Bitmin,"Ok so all this server is a hub for friends to play games, chat, hangout, and genrally have fun. This server is ment to be a replacement for the orginal frostbite server that has become very large and unwieldy. The orginal frostbite server has also become very inactive and stagnate as a result of its size. That is why am hopeing to keep this community relatively small so that we can be active and have fun."

Bitmin,oh I know that
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,I don't get their reasoning
Bitmin,but its not blocked now
Bitmin,so thats good
Bitmin,the dumb thing is that my dad is a web arcitech so he knows stuff about computers

Bitmin,I did
Bitmin,its the chronological order all the marvel movies take place in timeline wise
Bitmin,How was this timeline created?
Bitmin,people with alot of time on their hands
Bitmin,i mean it makes sense
Bitmin,starts with first captain america and ends with guardians of the galaxy
Bitmin,What the hell is Cloak & Dagger?
Bitmin,unreleased stuff
Bitmin,clock can travel into different dimensions and dagger kills people
Bitmin,its a little tv series that hasnt come out yet
Bitmin,"""clock"""
Bitmin,cloak*
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,I wasn't doubting the validness(?) of the timeline
Bitmin,I was just wondering how they determined it
Bitmin,Because I am interested in that stuff
Bitmin,for the released stuff its kinda obvious
Bitmin,since they use specific dates in the actual movies
Bitmin,so you can jsut be like oh yeah
Bitmin,there it is
Bitmin,and for the unreleased stuff i think its jsut Theory Crafting
Bitmin,okay so the list of currently Released Movies we need to watch in Order is...
Bitmin,"Captain America 1

Bitmin,I gotta go to work but legit think about it maybe over march break @The Rona
Bitmin,not all in one day obv
Bitmin,I'm down
Bitmin,yo lit
Bitmin,ill try and figure out which ones are on netflix and which ones ill need to pirate
Bitmin,bad
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,Pirating things is wrong
Bitmin,it is stealing
Bitmin,and if everyone did it no more movies would be made
Bitmin,just think about that
Bitmin,http://puu.sh/ujKXT/d8381d16a8.jpg
Bitmin,and by pirating something when not everyone else does it is like saying you are better than them
Bitmin,most things you dont even need to pirate
Bitmin,you know photoshop?
Bitmin,and other adobe products
Bitmin,i have the files from adobe im using their files
Bitmin,not third party
Bitmin,i just know how to mess with the security on it and make my free trial go from lasting 7 days to 1000 days
Bitmin,that is stealing and wrong
Bitmin,no third party programs or software adobe jsut has really loose security for being such a large company
Bitmin,thats on them
Bitmin,if a store had no alarm system and just a bad lock would it be okay to steal from that store?
Bitmin,no becuase that is stealing not pirating
Bitmin,PIRACY IS STEALING
Bitmin,there is no a finite amount of computer programs or files
Bitmin,there is a finite amount of objects
Bitmin,but you still obtain something without payment to the creator
Bitmin,"Piracy is a Victimless Crime, Stealing is not."
Bitmin,NO
Bitmin,if you made something and everyone pirated it you would be very upset becasue you would make 0 MONEY
Bitmin,"if its a small startup or something like and indie game/film from a small company i will pay for their products and support them if i think its worth my money, but if its a large company like Adobe or Marvel where my 1 Aquisition without payment will not affect them then i feel no shame in doing what i do"
Bitmin,how can you even defend yourself? you know its illegal and wrong yet you try to come up with reasons why it is okay even though you know you wouldn't like it if someone pirated something you made
Bitmin,Big companies deserve money for their work just as much as small ones
Bitmin,im not trying to defend myself
Bitmin,am i doing something illegal? yes.
Bitmin,do i feel remorse? no.
Bitmin,Piracy is Comparable to Jaywalking
Bitmin,yeah its illegal but nobody cares
Bitmin,that is so untrue
Bitmin,@The Rona I mgiht be Busy March 11-15 but im free the other days of march break i believe
Bitmin,@here games bois?
Bitmin,maybe
Bitmin,i'm kinda enjoying my pokemon and chill session ive got going on tho
Bitmin,you should join me and chris for a pokemans nuzlocke challenge at some point
Bitmin,Yo boyd
Bitmin,In a work meeting
Bitmin,I'm literally never not pirating something
Bitmin,@SWIRL GIRL It's ok I support your pirating 110%
Bitmin,thanks fam
Bitmin,np
Bitmin,"to put my two cents in about pirating, yeah it's illegal, yeah it's morally wrong, but it's prevelant enough that most companies work it into their assumptions about how much money they can make and at that point it's become so standard that it almost doesn't matter"
Bitmin,but personally
Bitmin,Sylki join so we can play my game when doctor comes back
Bitmin,"I only pirate stuff like books I can get from the library but am too lazy to walk to, old games that I'd be getting second hand so the original creators don't make any money anyway, or software that I already own but it's on my old computer and a massive pain to transfer"
Bitmin,doc is back btw
Bitmin,and textbooks cause they're crazy overpriced and there's no way to know if you're actually gonna need them till like 1/3 of the way through the course
Bitmin,also I'm busy and I'm not gonna be able to play tonight
Bitmin,okay
Bitmin,also how do you even pirate a textbook?
Bitmin,@The Rona Older misha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tSZEMc1CVk

Bitmin,He's the artist of that picture
Bitmin,He has a whole bunch of stuff like that that breaks perspective and positioning and it's super neat
Bitmin,I've only ever heard of him as the person who drew this picture
Bitmin,I had never heard of him before now
Bitmin,His stuff is pretty cool
Bitmin,honestly he's one of my favourite artists
Bitmin,he fiddles with the ways you have to draw to give the illusion of a third dimension in order to make trippy geometrically impossible pictures and they're always super interesting

Bitmin,Orisa
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,Go-to play overwatch
Bitmin,"What is this, a discord for owls?"
Bitmin,On YouTube
Bitmin,Send links
Bitmin,wow the alt fire sounds super OP
Bitmin,Yeah it does
Bitmin,She look really good
Bitmin,Also Bastion is getting a small nerf
Bitmin,"Instead of 35% damage resistance, they are lowering it to 20%"
Bitmin,Why do they gotta release the new hero when I have a test tomorrow ;-;
Bitmin,I don't think its for a while yet
Bitmin,Is just on ptr thou
Bitmin,She's on the PTR
Bitmin,The new hero sounds pretty bad
Bitmin,How so?
Bitmin,Her weapon slows her while firing
Bitmin,Also abilities just sound kinda useless in general
Bitmin,Non moving shields aren't that useful
Bitmin,Because people move a lot in overwatch
Bitmin,Fortify just sounds really dumb
Bitmin,If you slow down whole shooting
Bitmin,*while
Bitmin,Thoughts? @The Rona
Bitmin,How you gonna sit there and do my ass like that
Bitmin,I don't think the slowing while firing matters too too much
Bitmin,Especially since we don't know her damage right now
Bitmin,Depending on the shield cool-down the non moving might not be a problem
Bitmin,"The alt-fire seems pretty good, mini grav + hook, and it slows you"
Bitmin,I have more too add but I am in chem right now
Bitmin,I think that her abilities are counterproductive
Bitmin,Shut up
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane The alt fire can be used to pull people off of high ground
Bitmin,also dva slows down when she shoots and she's pretty good
Bitmin,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Bitmin,900
Bitmin,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Bitmin,900
Bitmin,"So, her gun it pretty good"
Bitmin,it's a bit weird tho
Bitmin,looks like it should be hitscan
Bitmin,isn't hitscan
Bitmin,"Yeah, it's projectiles"
Bitmin,seems strong tho
Bitmin,"she could be good, we'll have to see"
Bitmin,i like the gravity thing she has
Bitmin,welp I was just on a team with a 76 and a mccree who couldn't kill their idiot pharah

Bitmin,new hero?
Bitmin,yee boy
Bitmin,seems pretty cool. I could see playing her with mercy on defense instead of ana
Bitmin,I'm pretty sure the damage boost from her ult doesn't stack with Mercy's
Bitmin,that would make since
Bitmin,I have a feeling she's going to be the go to second tank in a bastion meta
Bitmin,esspecially on defense
Bitmin,"I can see her + rein being really infuriating to deal with, cause you're got two decently sized shields with the whole team hiding behind them, if you get too close you have to deal with the rein hammer and if you stay far out you have to deal with her machine gun mowing people down"
Bitmin,does her grav thing pull through shields?
Bitmin,it goes through shields
Bitmin,I don't think her gun has falloff damage
Bitmin,"nah I mean if you detonate it in front of a shield, will it pull the people behind it?"
Bitmin,it does for sure
Bitmin,starts at like 25-30 meters
Bitmin,wait
Bitmin,maybe not
Bitmin,I think it might pull through shields
Bitmin,I'm pretty sure there is no falloff
Bitmin,It's just her spread
Bitmin,spread gets crazy there though
Bitmin,making you hit less
Bitmin,I could see people getting crazy environmental kills with her grav though
Bitmin,like indoor nepal
Bitmin,I wonder if it pulls through walls
Bitmin,like Zarya's graviton
Bitmin,I dont think so
Bitmin,it looks like it needs los
Bitmin,You could use it on that wall on Lijang
Bitmin,If it doesn't need los
Bitmin,you wouldn't need the wall just shoot it off the stage and detonate it
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,Also I don't know if you guys know this but when she uses her fortify ability she gets a 50% damage resistance (I think)
Bitmin,but that makes me think that it shouldn't be able to pull through shields

Bitmin,ROB dropped 13 places

Bitmin,gg ROB
Bitmin,wait actually only 5
Bitmin,was looking at the wrong old tier list
Bitmin,Good mistake
Bitmin,still he's now in the bottom half of the list
Bitmin,why is sonic 5th
Bitmin,there's like one player who does ok with sonic ever and he's actually a cloud main
Bitmin,only 1.5 people do well with falco in melee and he is second
Bitmin,1.5?
Bitmin,mango is .5
Bitmin,westballz is 1
Bitmin,I see
Bitmin,and even westballz uses fox for certain matchups
Bitmin,so maybe 1.2?
Bitmin,"TIL Samuel L Jackson likes anime

Bitmin,Samuel L. Jackson Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions | WI...
Bitmin,"yes, but there's a lot of decent falco players or players with decent falcos"
Bitmin,you look at the top 50 or so players and there are a lot of falcos
Bitmin,Isn't ppmd a good falco?
Bitmin,"you look at sm4sh top 50, first sign of a sonic is at 12th, and the guy barely plays sonic anymore, instead focusing on cloud, and even then he doesn't have particularly good results"
Bitmin,He's a Marth main yeah
Bitmin,and the other 3 sonics in the top 50 never make top 8
Bitmin,rarely make top 16
Bitmin,"and yet he's over 4 characters who have won majors (mario, mewtwo, marth, zss)"
Bitmin,also somehow bayo snuck out on top
Bitmin,she's definately high/top tier but not the best in the game
Bitmin,don't think bayo's ever done better than 4th or 5th at majors
Bitmin,yeah her best ever result at a major (even pre-nerf) is 4th and somehow she's considered the best character in the game
Bitmin,What is the criteria for the tier list  though?
Bitmin,"it's also funny looking at this tier list in relation to kingston sm4sh, where, based on our current PR (which admittadly has some odd parts), from #1 down through the honourable mentions, we play 28th, 35th, 38th (working on switching to 4th), 36th, 17th, 40th, 7th/43rd (and he's far better at 43rd), 12th, 47th, 23rd/11th, and then honourable mentions play 12th/6th, 6th/37th, and 4th"
Bitmin,everyone who plays a character in S or A tier (1-12) are all 7th or worse
Bitmin,Your number 1 player plays DK?
Bitmin,"I'm pretty sure the list is supposed to be based on how good the character is on paper, which imo is kind of dumb when in some cases there's little to no proof that they're that good in practice, and some characters who suck on paper have pretty good results"
Bitmin,yeah DKBill
Bitmin,"DK, Ike, Shulk (trying to get a sheik going), wario, villager, g&w, fox/little mac (way better at little mac, is gonna be climbing back up now that he's switched back), ryu, kirby, captain falcon/zss"
Bitmin,"not counting the guy working on swtiching to sheik, our only person who plays an s-tier is an honourable mention"

Bitmin,Kameron that was so terrible stop this
Bitmin,you dont usually play this game straightfoward lmao
Bitmin,Kameron you threw

Bitmin,Why banished though?
Bitmin,so I don't get Ava sick
Bitmin,tell Ava to get bent
Bitmin,pull rank on her
Bitmin,you were there first
Bitmin,wait you are older right?
Bitmin,Ava and I hold the opinion that the sick person should concede their rights to the well person
Bitmin,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring
Bitmin,we have agreed on this in the past
Bitmin,I must honor my agreement
Bitmin,fair enough
Bitmin,Are you one of those older child supremacists?
Bitmin,are there any non-first-born older child supremacists?

Bitmin,boooooooooooooooooooooooo
Bitmin,And they are also removing the ability for Zen to apply discord orb through barriers
Bitmin,that kinda makes sense
Bitmin,nah im not an older child supremecist im actually the youngest in my family
Bitmin,i just run the house
Bitmin,then why did you need to mention that he is older?
Bitmin,cause he should pull rank on you
Bitmin,but he does not outrank me
Bitmin,"I made a youtube banner for my friends channel, any feedback or changes i should make before sending it to her?"
Bitmin,"nah, looks good"
Bitmin,"make sure the ""art and animation"" part has the same sized margins as the name"
Bitmin,cause right now they're tighter and it looks a bit odd
Bitmin,other than that it's lookin good
Bitmin,yeah thats my b I see it now too
Bitmin,also might want to make it not italicized
Bitmin,they were the same sized margins but then I made the aubtext italic so yeah forgot to account for that
Bitmin,it's up to you but I'm personally a fan of consistancy with this sort of thing so I'd keep it non-italic
Bitmin,well im using different fonts aswell for the titlw and subtext
Bitmin,im trying to break them up
Bitmin,I have no idea how it'd look but you might also want to try the same kind of text border thing you have going for hte main title on the subtitle
Bitmin,"different fonts works, but I prefer to keep them in a similar theme"
Bitmin,k thanks for the advice (not sarcasm)
Bitmin,"cause already you have different size, positioning, and font, adding the italics is just a tad too much imo"

Bitmin,mango never went mario I'm pretty sure

Bitmin,I don't think he's taken games with his sheik today
Bitmin,yes he has
Bitmin,"not sure tho, mostly been watching sm4sh"
Bitmin,he took 1 vs shroomed
Bitmin,and 1 vs hungry pidgeon
Bitmin,shrugs no idea then
Bitmin,whose your bet on the winner?
Bitmin,hbox of course
Bitmin,the safe pick
Bitmin,his only threat is m2k
Bitmin,no one else has even a small chance of beating him
Bitmin,hasn't m2k been beating hbox lately?
Bitmin,last set was summit where he lost
Bitmin,but prior to that was a local where they traded sets
Bitmin,could go either way
Bitmin,no player other than m2k can beat hbox
Bitmin,of moon and shroomed who do you think would do better if they make WF?
Bitmin,I think shroomed would have a better chance against both m2k and hbox
Bitmin,barring something insane (equivilant to that random wizzy over hbox) you're right
Bitmin,but I'm just gonna sit here and hope for more upsets
Bitmin,wizzy did it twice actually
Bitmin,once was vs a broken finger hbox though
Bitmin,I thought Armada was the best tho
Bitmin,"I woulnd't be super surprised if there were more upsets, it's been a fairly upset heavy tourney, in both games"
Bitmin,armada's not in the bracket
Bitmin,armada isn't attending

Bitmin,maybe i'll just harass kameron with them again
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,do that
Bitmin,no toxic
Bitmin,anime is cool tho :(
Bitmin,"Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world. Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves. All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people.

- George Bernard Shaw"
Bitmin,"Just playing devils advocate, based on his statement, stability and not being an asshole are the sole domain of the reasonable"
Bitmin,Which makes this a shaky argument for the unreasonable unless he enforced the importance of both
Bitmin,And you just didn't include the whole quote
Bitmin,"I think what is meant by this is that the people who ask ""so why isn't that possible"" are the unreasonable people because most people just accept it can't be done"
Bitmin,that is all of the quote I was given
Bitmin,if there is more that is my schools fault for not including the rest
Bitmin,Fair enough
Bitmin,I took it as a quote encouraging innovation and asking questions
Bitmin,which is something I appreciate
Bitmin,Based on the adapt to the world/adapt the world phrasing I think my point about the importance of both stands
Bitmin,I don't believe there is more to the quote
Bitmin,Adapting the world to you is the same as creating things to make your life easier
Bitmin,like making AC
Bitmin,the world is now whatever temperature I want
Bitmin,boom
Bitmin,Because if everyone tried to change the world to suit them we'd have a mess if t weren't for those who adapt to maintain it
Bitmin,world adapted
Bitmin,that is why most people are born with no sense of doing and are lazy
Bitmin,almost no one actually cares
Bitmin,Symbiotic n stuff
Bitmin,those who adapt to the world are mere followers
Bitmin,they can never make a difference
Bitmin,See a lot of you guys are very ambitious and want to have a huge impact with your job
Bitmin,Whereas all I really want is to get a good blue collar job
Bitmin,Not some field where I am a pioneer and I have to create and research new things
Bitmin,to each their own
Bitmin,"I'm not attacking the ones who make a difference, I'm just saying that both types are needed for those differences to become a part of a stable society"
Bitmin,You can't lead if everyone is a leader
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,I can lead but honestly I'd rather have my job clearly set out for me
Bitmin,but I believe that people are born in a proportion to what is needed by intelligent design
Bitmin,I get the work done and go home
Bitmin,"I'm reminded of a school trip I took back in middle school, at one point we had a motivational speaker talking to us, and he did a little ""repeat after me"" thing, going through stuff like ""I will live my life to its fullest"", ""I won't back down from a challenge"", etc, but then at one point he goes ""I will lead not follow"" and the whole room repeats this, with me and a friend just silently looking at each other and trying not to crack up"
Bitmin,"Most people are content as or would rather be followers, even if they'd say otherwise if you asked them"
Bitmin,that is accurate
Bitmin,see opinion above
Bitmin,"This was mostly in agreement with that (not a personal believer in intelligent design, but with the rest of it)"
Bitmin,"Personally, if the person I'm following is doing a better job than I could I'm fine not being in charge but if not Ill usually take charge"
Bitmin,The only issue with being a follower is making sure you are following the right leadee
Bitmin,"Which was a bitch for group projects in high school, where in my friend group I was at the top end of the bottom half, in terms of organization/leadership ability, so I'd always get stuck wrangling my super lazy/disorganized friends"
Bitmin,Sounds like every group project I've been in 
Bitmin,never done a group project but they sound horrible
Bitmin,They are
Bitmin,"Or consider our old tf2 team, where I main called for most of it just because I had more experience than you guys, despite not being a particularly great main caller and much preferring to manage a smaller chunk of the team (as roamer or scout I normally micromanage the flank, or as med usually just the combo) and let someone else handle the main strats"
Bitmin,us people who actually care get killed by those who are okay with a C
Bitmin,Any decent teacher groups you with people at your grade level or lets you choose your own groups
Bitmin,And the rare group projects with a good group are glorious
Bitmin,It's so dumb cause most teachers at my school assign groups
Bitmin,"One history project though I got the best group ever, like they were down to work on it outside of school and we ended up getting a 100% on it"
Bitmin,"Also, as a brief aside, some people who are happy with a C care quite a bit but just aren't equipped to do better (and yes they still drag you down but not for lack of caring)"
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak I invented a new melee crew battle format
Bitmin,it involves two teams of 6
Bitmin,and all the characters
Bitmin,in some way
Bitmin,"there's a guy in the kingston sm4sh discord whose current name is ""Darwid, Guac Master"""
Bitmin,what is that?
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,I DON'T KNOW
Bitmin,I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IT IS
Bitmin,wait actually it's probably derwood
Bitmin,It's me
Bitmin,no idea where the guac master came from
Bitmin,want to try my new format later today?
Bitmin,hellllllaaaa busy
Bitmin,two assignments and a test tomrrow
Bitmin,good luck
Bitmin,How does your format work Quick?
Bitmin,you ban and pick characters in the fairest order I could make until each player ends up with 6 characters then you play crew battle style
Bitmin,cool

Bitmin,evidence #2 - my dinner is pop tarts
Bitmin,sorry buddy
Bitmin,same tho
Bitmin,that means you are on the road to adulthood
Bitmin,it's basically just that I ate lunch at 4 and I've been snacking all day so I'm completely not hungry
Bitmin,and as a result don't have the energy for actual food
Bitmin,Poor Sylki and his poptarts
Bitmin,what flavor poptarts though
Bitmin,asking the real questions
Bitmin,the pop tarts are great but they are symbolic of my life's slow but inevitable descent into chaos and madness
Bitmin,um
Bitmin,one sec lemme check

Bitmin,lol what a loser
Bitmin,Bush had a higher approval rating than that
Bitmin,"and I don't even know what she did wrong, I've heard of no controversial bills, no scandals, no one expressing a particular dislike, nothing"
Bitmin,fake news?
Bitmin,but clearly something has gone horribly wrong
Bitmin,maybe she isn't disliked that much
Bitmin,"I'm assuming that yeah, she's not the target of strong dislike, just not many people particularly like her"
Bitmin,alternatively since it's provincial level I just haven't heard much cause it's smaller scale
Bitmin,but DAMN 12% approval rating is awful
Bitmin,What's her name?
Bitmin,kathleen wynne
Bitmin,or something like that
Bitmin,dunno exact spelling

Bitmin,but nope he's going to a sm4sh tournament
Bitmin,he just got basically jv3'd by a top 20 player
Bitmin,he only technically didn't jv3 him cause he took 1 damage from being too far offscreen while killing bizz
Bitmin,does he play ganon?

Bitmin,edgy long hair swordsmen?
Bitmin,i'd believe it
Bitmin,somehow neither of them is edgy in game
Bitmin,boi dunban is extra edgy
Bitmin,hello???
Bitmin,how is he edgy?
Bitmin,other than that he's metal af
Bitmin,err sorry not dunban i'm dumb
Bitmin,the other one is edgy
Bitmin,I mean I only just met him
Bitmin,he doesn't seem that edgy
Bitmin,dunban is not that edgy in fairness
Bitmin,oh oops no spoiling then
Bitmin,uh oh
Bitmin,suddenly very worried
Bitmin,ts nothing major just he becomes more edgy later on
Bitmin,aight
Bitmin,dunban is super metal tho
Bitmin,at least at the start
Bitmin,oh yeah totally
Bitmin,but he becomes less edgy as it goes on
Bitmin,"man burns out all the nerves in one arm fighting the good fight, waits a year, then comes right back in fighting with the other arm and giving zero fucks"
Bitmin,man runs straight down a cliff
Bitmin,yeah and then it turns out he's the mentor character like
Bitmin,
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,the other dude (lao?) is kinda like the opposite
Bitmin,@Zain what was network id and passowrd
Bitmin,starts out chill and develops the badass/edgy-ness?
Bitmin,yeah basically
Bitmin,lao's got nuts dps
Bitmin,also true
Bitmin,"for a sniper dude who keeps going ""it's not my forte, but..."" every time I go for melee combos he's got some damn good melee arts"
Bitmin,and that one art that buffs everyone's ranged stuff is so good
Bitmin,especially when my main character does giant laser beams
Bitmin,yeah lao is super good at the point where you first get to use him
Bitmin,its been to fucking long since i played x tho liek actually
Bitmin,I just got it a few days ago
Bitmin,thus far loving it
Bitmin,i played it on release which was like a few years ago i think
Bitmin,yeah I was hoping the price would go down before I got it
Bitmin,its a great game tho
Bitmin,ran out of patience
Bitmin,oh unlucky
Bitmin,Lin is such a good character
Bitmin,shame her design is super uncanny valley and all
Bitmin,just remember she's 13
Bitmin,"""13"""
Bitmin,yeah I know
Bitmin,I'm not saying she's attractive
Bitmin,she's just really funny
Bitmin,no i'm just making fun of the super young tech nerd cliche but she's a well developed character
Bitmin,and she's also funny which is nice
Bitmin,there's something just.... off... about her model
Bitmin,it's super unsettling and I can't put my finger on it
Bitmin,she has bug eyes curved downward which make her look a little off sometimes
Bitmin,that might be it
Bitmin,the characters have fairly normal eyes but lin has really big eyes in comparison
Bitmin,I mean I gave my character purple and teal cat eyes and it's somehow less unsettling
Bitmin,(also don't ask how purple and teal work together but somehow they do)
Bitmin,idk mans
Bitmin,Still the greatest sin this game has is not allowing us to play as Tatsu
Bitmin,noooo tatsu's annoying
Bitmin,never been a fan of the nopon
Bitmin,we need to successor to the heropon
Bitmin,didn't really like riki either
Bitmin,riki was hype
Bitmin,he's comic relief and occasional emotional crutch for melia and beyond that he serves no purpose
Bitmin,reyn and riki together made it much better
Bitmin,and he's not even a good party member
Bitmin,Wait that's actually not true riki is easily one of the better ones
Bitmin,really? I never figured out how to make him any good
Bitmin,he's a magic tank and he's got like half the statuses
Bitmin,yeah but he can't draw aggro
Bitmin,so being a tank is useless
Bitmin,he focuses on statusing
Bitmin,statuses draw aggro i believe
Bitmin,moreso than big damage
Bitmin,I could never get him to hold aggro
Bitmin,dunno
Bitmin,its nbd unless you're going for like max difficulty runs or something
Bitmin,shrugs he never did any work for me
Bitmin,best party for me was dunban fiora sharla
Bitmin,mad jukes and on the offchance you get hit sharla's got your back
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,dunban fiora melia is good for most of the game up until you start hitting frequent enemies with strong AoE that just kills melia without her even having aggro
Bitmin,i kinda gave up on sharla because overheating is a terrible mechanic
Bitmin,just never play as sharla and you won't notice
Bitmin,no i notices because she just doesnt do anything
Bitmin,and she eventually gets a skill that halves the time it takes
Bitmin,yeah but by then i could just use melia
Bitmin,eh she just has less overall healing
Bitmin,yeah but she's got more than enough damage to make up for it
Bitmin,and in the late game stuff gets AoE that can one shot her without her having aggro and without getting a vision
Bitmin,and then once you revive her it takes ages to get heals back up properly
Bitmin,reyn melia shulk/dunban is  how i went most of the game
Bitmin,yeah that's true
Bitmin,how on earth did you run reyn melia? melia never seems to give enough heals to sustain him at all
Bitmin,if the enemies were being aoe happy i'd just play her and play super conservatively
Bitmin,also can we talk about how shit melia's AI is?
Bitmin,absolutely
Bitmin,its terrible
Bitmin,"if you've got melia in the party, you play melia"
Bitmin,also sustaining reyn wasn't that bad
Bitmin,skyfactoryfb
Bitmin,what elementals did you use?
Bitmin,"melia had slow heals but she did work, and whenever i ran shulk we had monado shield and stuff too"
Bitmin,I mean melia's great for 4/5 of the time she's in the party
Bitmin,I hoenstly don't even remember its been way too longs since I played chronicles
Bitmin,actually what i think i did was
Bitmin,i'd healing gift and then hide int he back with water elemental
Bitmin,and then just try and pooke with fire and electric
Bitmin,huh I did basically the same
Bitmin,but it seemed like healing gift couldn't really keep up
Bitmin,yeah sometimes reyn would get low so i'd have to burn a water discharge
Bitmin,it seemed like the main issue was just the cooldown
Bitmin,shrugs
Bitmin,melia dunban was nuts tho
Bitmin,i dont remember the specifics my last full playthrough of chronicles was easily over three years ago
Bitmin,especially if you did water+lightning+wind and he just gets even more agility
Bitmin,dunban made me feel guilty using him lmao
Bitmin,he's so good

Bitmin,this would be like a hype mango vs armada themed tournament and hbox just wins
Bitmin,rosa > ness might be the worst matchup in any smash game
Bitmin,"this would be like, if at G3 mango went out to like abate and armada lost to like.... scar"
Bitmin,wow that extreme?
Bitmin,I have never heard of the guy who knocked zero out
Bitmin,then again he made top 96 so maybe a bit better
Bitmin,it'd be like if armada lost to trillium
Bitmin,or homemadewaffles
Bitmin,that would be super funny
Bitmin,the quivilant for armada to lose to like melee esam and then trillium
Bitmin,and then for mango to lose to like mafia and abate
Bitmin,who was ally's first loss?
Bitmin,trela
Bitmin,he's somewhere in the 40s I think
Bitmin,character?
Bitmin,ryu
Bitmin,oh actually he's 25th
Bitmin,what
Bitmin,oh it's almost a year outdated
Bitmin,was looking at the older rankings
Bitmin,trela's 42nd
Bitmin,"so if I'm gonna follow exact rankings, mang0 lost to Abu and Dizzkidboogie playing dk"
Bitmin,"actually going by position in the tier list, dkb's zelda"
Bitmin,and neither of the people zero lost to are ranked so I dunno how to compare it
Bitmin,there's also a link guarunteed at least 9th
Bitmin,that's the equivilant of a DK being guarunteed 9th at the most stacked melee tournament you've ever seen
Bitmin,this tournament is actually insane
Bitmin,DK is duuuuuuumb https://clips.twitch.tv/AggressiveSuccessfulCoyoteUncleNox

Bitmin,why?
Bitmin,this falcon player is by far the most fun to watch player I've ever seen in smash 4
Bitmin,dunno why they're outside
Bitmin,but yeah fatality's a crowd favourite for a reason
Bitmin,these are my two favourite players
Bitmin,I still want nairo to win tho

Bitmin,wow 3-0 comeback
Bitmin,hooooooly shit
Bitmin,fatality is soooo nuts
Bitmin,that pop off too
Bitmin,he's so hyped
Bitmin,that set was insane
Bitmin,that might have been the best set I've seen all year
Bitmin,that was also a really short set
Bitmin,is smash 4 usually that fast?
Bitmin,like games end quickly
Bitmin,nope
Bitmin,that's basically the peak of aggro play in sm4sh
Bitmin,if only the whole game was like that
Bitmin,"fastest players you're likely to see are nairo, fatality, SuperGirlKels (tho she's lower level), esam's pika, larry lurr"
Bitmin,also marss
Bitmin,forgot about marss
Bitmin,what about hax
Bitmin,sm4sh
Bitmin,not melee
Bitmin,only problem with fatality is he's really bad at slowing it down when he needs to
Bitmin,even if someone's doing a great job walling him out he'll keep bashing his head against it
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,I found the mythical 8
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,"commentators currently discussing whether to call the mewtwo combo abandango invented ""The Aba-combo"" or ""The Combo-dango"""
Bitmin,aba combo is better
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,I'm partial to the combo-dango
Bitmin,that one kinda sounds inappropriate
Bitmin,so?
Bitmin,it's so much more fun to say
Bitmin,esports needs to be esports
Bitmin,aba-combo is easier to say
Bitmin,"various sm4sh combos are commonly called ""The hoo-hah"", ""The ding-dong"", ""The beep-boop"", etc."
Bitmin,"I agree, and it sounds better"
Bitmin,aba-combo
Bitmin,we don't do legit sounding names of things
Bitmin,"I'm not sure if you guys have heard how abadango is pronounced, but the dango part sounds pretty similar to combo"
Bitmin,it basically ends up sounding like combo-dongo
Bitmin,which is why it's easy to replace dango with combo
Bitmin,shrugs
Bitmin,still more fun to say
Bitmin,but I'll agree to disagree
Bitmin,also I kinda just hate you so you know
Bitmin,kinda have to disagree
Bitmin,
Bitmin,DK IN TOP 8
Bitmin,another top 10 player out
Bitmin,7/10 have been eliminated
Bitmin,"only one in top 8 thus far, two of them are in losers"
Bitmin,wow
Bitmin,I was watching the DK set
Bitmin,DK's duuuuumb
Bitmin,that MU looks brutal tho
Bitmin,cause sheik has such a hard time killing
Bitmin,and DK's so heavy and he's never gonna let her get rage
Bitmin,I don't think mr r got over 100% that whole set
Bitmin,if you're still watching witness my least favourite character
Bitmin,fuck ryu
Bitmin,why?
Bitmin,"man has a kill confirm at like 65-90 (rage dependant) off uptilt or downtilt, both of which are somewhere between frame 1-3"
Bitmin,plus it's safe on shield
Bitmin,and he's super heavy so he always gets a ton of rage
Bitmin,he has a fast shield breaker so you can't just shield
Bitmin,on bigger characters (like ROB) he can nairplane you across the stage into a spike
Bitmin,he has a cancellable super-armour move
Bitmin,that is also a free setup into his best kill move (aka you die at like 65 if he's got rage)
Bitmin,rob even has a decent matchup against ryu (pretty close to 50/50 imo) but he's just such a pain to fight against
Bitmin,"cause ryu has trouble approaching through projectiles, but he touches you and you're boned"
Bitmin,nairo why would you go to T&C and give ryu a lower cieling
Bitmin,you have to play so campy against ryu and it's so boring and also terrifying
Bitmin,noooooo fuck ryu
Bitmin,8/10 of the top ten eliminated before top 8
Bitmin,"silver lining, canada made top 8"
Bitmin,but ugh fuck ryu
Bitmin,9/10
Bitmin,9/10 of the top ten out before top eight
Bitmin,what the hell
Bitmin,4/5 of the top 5 out
Bitmin,jesus christ
Bitmin,who is the one still in?
Bitmin,dabuz
Bitmin,#4
Bitmin,My personal pick for who I want to win is captain zack because bayo is super cool
Bitmin,or fatality
Bitmin,hhahahaha clearly you've never fought a bayo
Bitmin,no I never play this game
Bitmin,yeah I know
Bitmin,cool to watch
Bitmin,like falco
Bitmin,falco is super bad in smash 4
Bitmin,too bad
Bitmin,I'm cheering for fatality or marss
Bitmin,"safe money is on dabuz, kirihara, or captain zack"
Bitmin,"but then again, safe bets have very much not prevailed this tournament"
Bitmin,at the same time it'd be so sick to see T or Hikaru win for the low tiers
Bitmin,it'd be like DK or Yoshi winning evo for melee
Bitmin,are they in the same approximate place on the tier list or same level of viability because I don't think that those two things are equal comparing smash 4 and melee
Bitmin,approximate tier list placement
Bitmin,basically just did ((sm4sh tier list placement) / (number of characters in sm4sh)) * (number of characters in melee) and rounded it
Bitmin,but honestly in terms of viability it wouldn't be much different
Bitmin,then again I guess you could argue that this shakes things up (ie if they're making top 8 clearly they're underrated on the tier list and in general considerations of their viability)
Bitmin,"to summarize, you see why I don't feel like I'm handicapping myself by playing 33rd on the tier list?"
Bitmin,"I made it on one team, but I have another tryout later"
Bitmin,gg
Bitmin,where is my mans @Mr. Airplane
Bitmin,@Max if you're not still watching we're in top 8
Bitmin,I'm watching
Bitmin,what is it with japanese players and covering their faces?
Bitmin,it's a thing you do when you're sick
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,kids at my school do it
Bitmin,thats nice
Bitmin,"or if people aroudn you are, and I'm assuming they're all mostly staying together so if one of them's sick they're all gonna cover up"
Bitmin,well the ones from most Asain countries that is
Bitmin,also captain zack's american
Bitmin,oh really?
Bitmin,rip i wanted to watch top 8
Bitmin,just physicall y janapense
Bitmin,but now I have csgo stuff
Bitmin,"even though I'm not a fan of bayo, I'm still cheering for captain zack cause I really want to see someone who's never won a major win the most stacked sm4sh tourney to date"
Bitmin,I don't like bayo either
Bitmin,so unless they fight each other I'm cheering against dabuz and kirihara
Bitmin,that combo was lit though
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,I'm a little behind you
Bitmin,should be caught up now
Bitmin,what character is that little doll that dabuz has with him?
Bitmin,I don't like bayo but I do like the way captain zack plays
Bitmin,I missed it I dunno
Bitmin,description?
Bitmin,pink hair yellow and black outfit
Bitmin,it will probably show up again
Bitmin,shrugs I'll keep an eye out
Bitmin,same color scheme as his rosa skin
Bitmin,but with pink hair?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,no idea what the doll is
Bitmin,dabuz has the freest bracket tho
Bitmin,he's basically guarunteed 2nd
Bitmin,I wonder if links super lame style or falcons super fast style will be the dominant style of this match
Bitmin,T's actually pretty aggro for a link
Bitmin,but that's till not that aggro
Bitmin,my guess is that Link's gonna dictate the pace just cause it's Fatality
Bitmin,man has no chill
Bitmin,but it might not matter
Bitmin,we shall see
Bitmin,see? link's not that lame
Bitmin,I used to play a lot of link
Bitmin,wouldn't mind seeing him win
Bitmin,I'm still cheering for fatality
Bitmin,even if T might be better against dabuz
Bitmin,cause a) fatality's awesome and b) rosa link would be soooo slow
Bitmin,do bombs have kill potential?
Bitmin,sort of
Bitmin,bombs themselves don't kill
Bitmin,but they can set up into kills
Bitmin,T's nuts
Bitmin,T's nuts
Bitmin,fucking insane
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,what % chance would you give him vs dabuz?
Bitmin,I have no idea what the matchup's like
Bitmin,hm
Bitmin,70-30 in dabuz's favour
Bitmin,maybe 65-35
Bitmin,"I can see the sword being able to contest rosa's range, but then also link can't cover his landings with dair cause rosa's up air is so disjoined"
Bitmin,I wonder if bombs on shield will mess with luma
Bitmin,I honestly have no idea how the matchup's gonna go
Bitmin,the more I think the better it seems for T
Bitmin,"dabuz is a studier and a learner, and I'm gonna assume he didn't really look at T or Link"
Bitmin,I'm gonna end at 60-40 dabuz
Bitmin,my god zack what was that combo
Bitmin,that was disgusting
Bitmin,and why are you surprised they ranked this character first?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,due to the lack of results
Bitmin,I don't think it's reasonable to say someone's the best character when none of the best players play them
Bitmin,think about the last 2 years of melee. the top fox placing in a tournament is usually 2nd or 3rd while peach's is 1st and fox is still ranked 5 places higher
Bitmin,and she may have mad punishes but she loses some pretty key matchups and can struggle to approach (did you see how much trouble he was having getting anything started on dabuz)
Bitmin,I'm not saying you should do it purely by player ranking
Bitmin,but it's definately a way to get a partial judgement
Bitmin,"the fact that there's only one puff and one peach in the top 20 or so (I forget where macD is, possibly top 30) should tell you that they aren't as good as their best players make them look"
Bitmin,whereas there's a ton of fox
Bitmin,or the characters are seen as boring by the general public so the people attempting to play them are much fewer in number
Bitmin,which is actually true
Bitmin,if you look at the distribution of mains
Bitmin,oh my goodness the disrespect
Bitmin,CZ gives no fucks about his opponants' feelings
Bitmin,zero fucks whatsoever
Bitmin,I missed it what happened?
Bitmin,"taunted in game, taunted in real life"
Bitmin,he's taunted so many times
Bitmin,fthrow taunt is a true combo
Bitmin,is her taunt an attack?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,he just throws people and then taunts
Bitmin,let's goooo fatality
Bitmin,that was probably a hype set too bad I missed it
Bitmin,I saw the final kill
Bitmin,and thats it
Bitmin,fatality's nuts
Bitmin,kirihara almost reverse 3-0'd him
Bitmin,and then fatality turned up out of nowhere in the last 30 seconds or so
Bitmin,@everyone anyone want to play secret hitler tonight
Bitmin,maybe
Bitmin,depends how long this tourney goes
Bitmin,cause this might be the hypest sm4sh tourney I've ever seen
Bitmin,I agree with that because I find it interesting and i usually don't care to watch smash 4
Bitmin,a lot of unexpected aggro players doing really well
Bitmin,I'm hoping the meta evolves this way in the future
Bitmin,so apparently T has beaten kirihara (the other best rosa) so he might have a chance here
Bitmin,how much money does the winner get?
Bitmin,not sure
Bitmin,not something I really pay attention to
Bitmin,did you see how much shield damage that fair did? that's like half the shield
Bitmin,"on an unrelated note, kingston sm4sh discord has seen the return of our most cancerous community member"
Bitmin,haven't seen him since last year
Bitmin,the most toxic person I've ever talked to
Bitmin,the guy who basically stole from me
Bitmin,"he hosted a tourney at his house, I knocked him out at 4th, got 3rd, he declared only top 2 get money, then on the drive home (with 1st and 2nd) they counted their money and there a chunk missing"
Bitmin,and now he's back and already trying to start shit
Bitmin,just kick him from the discord then
Bitmin,if everyone agrees he is toxic
Bitmin,except not everyone does
Bitmin,and he's surprisingly good friends with one of our community leaders
Bitmin,and the guy who owns the discord
Bitmin,also I don't want to start shit with him
Bitmin,and there are even people who argue that the trash talk and stuff is good for the community
Bitmin,"""your popoff sucks"""
Bitmin,from the crowd
Bitmin,lololol
Bitmin,everyone hates dabuz for some reason
Bitmin,I love kingston sm4sh discord tho
Bitmin,"one guy (actually the melee zelda main) comments that, while he doesn't have a winning record against a lot of people, he couldn't think of anyone in the discord that he hasn't beaten"
Bitmin,then out of nowhere
Bitmin,"top player in ottawa shows up like ""yo what up?"" and has apparently been here for like half an hour just watching the conversation"
Bitmin,top tier lurking
Bitmin,what I want to see more than almost anything right now is fatality to 3-0 zack then give him the irl show me your moves
Bitmin,but I don't think he's that mean
Bitmin,let's gooooo fatality
Bitmin,that was crazy good
Bitmin,fatality's nuts
Bitmin,you almost got to see the fatality combo but T was juuuuust too low percent
Bitmin,that stomp footstool stomp footstool thing?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,so good
Bitmin,fatality in grands let's gooooooo
Bitmin,if he wins that would be so hype
Bitmin,he could do it
Bitmin,hard but doable
Bitmin,this guy makes smash 4 interesting to watch
Bitmin,these commentators are too loud
Bitmin,DMs ARE A THING
Bitmin,USE THEM
Bitmin,there used to be three of us watching
Bitmin,sorry
Bitmin,@here overwatch?
Bitmin,@Max almost done with tourney?
Bitmin,possibly
Bitmin,could be anywhere from one to seven more games
Bitmin,*one to eight
Bitmin,no one to seven
Bitmin,I have not finished my placements
Bitmin,I'm bad at math
Bitmin,can't play comp with you
Bitmin,booooo
Bitmin,fatality lost
Bitmin,it was so close but that early kill in the last game ate all his momentum
Bitmin,still crazy that he got 2nd
Bitmin,who won the whole thing?
Bitmin,dabuz
Bitmin,ah
Bitmin,"I am 57,358 of all faceit users"
Bitmin,"out of the 200,000 some that play"
Bitmin,VP just went 2-13 at half to overtime now
Bitmin,what map?
Bitmin,train
Bitmin,isn't train pretty one sided? didn't we do a similar thing the one time we played train?
Bitmin,eh it can be
Bitmin,where we got destroyed CT and then did pretty well on T?
Bitmin,but still
Bitmin,13-2
Bitmin,still impressive
Bitmin,both teams destroyed ct side though
Bitmin,shrugs
Bitmin,and they won

Bitmin,So I'm playing FE Heroes and mother of god look at this fabulous man I just summoned
Bitmin,LOOK AT HIM
Bitmin,most of the art in this game is either crap or super deep into the fanservice pit but with this alone it has redeemed itself

Bitmin,unfortunately Xander is quite easily the worst of the 4 fanservice characters
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,I got chrom too and he's kicking ass
Bitmin,he's just so much less fabulous tho
Bitmin,I'm also grudgingly impressed that they managed to somehow make Camilla even MORE fanservice-y

Bitmin,Competitive overwatch: episode 1
Bitmin,so apparently back in the '90s my university's student government had a 3-hour debate on whether or not to approve a campus Star Trek club because their constitution had a policy banning Klingons from being club members which the student government thought failed to promote equality
Bitmin,wat
Bitmin,http://kingstonherald.com/news/klingon-equity-queens-university-2010310319
Bitmin,"Klingon ""Equity"" Cited in Free Speech Grade for Queen's Universi..."
Bitmin,"AMS ""Student Union actions & practices"" gets a B in national report"
Bitmin,and yes that is a picture of a klingon photoshopped onto a picture of part of our campus
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Thats super dumb
Bitmin,who cares
Bitmin,that's a good question
Bitmin,really funny tho
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,also proof that it's not just millenials who do weird things in the name of equality
Bitmin,in your country it started much earlier
Bitmin,oh don't give me that
Bitmin,I'm sure if you dug around the states you'd find stuff
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,but you guys have been more progressive from farther back in time
Bitmin,"yeah, but I don't really qualify this as ""progressive"""
Bitmin,"more as ""slightly insane"""
Bitmin,its progressivism taken too far
Bitmin,although from the article I gather the issue was more about that other actually exclusive clubs could crop up using this as a precedent
Bitmin,oh that makes sense
Bitmin,"I mean I feel like it'd be pretty easy to make an argument against that working (""banning a fictional group is very different than banning an actual one, doesn't count as a precedent"") but at this level stuff like this has some legal standing so I can understand the caution and not wanting to have to have that argument"
Bitmin,My mic wasn't working
Bitmin,I'm pretty sure sm4sh wario mains have some of the best tags around
Bitmin,when I was in quebec over the summer there was a guy whose tag was WAHrrior and apparently there's some guy whose tag is EnigWAH
Bitmin,r/place has ended ;-;
Bitmin,"so I had this bright idea that cause I'm feeling pretty stressed I'm gonna work while listening to the upbeat/relaxing chunks of the chrono cross ost, and now I'm stuck cause I really just want to go play chrono cross and if there's one thing I really don't have time for it's a ~60 hour rpg"

Bitmin,"best profs I've had these two years have been differential+integral calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math (only in second year, first year discrete math the prof was pretty bad)"
Bitmin,so math profs are pretty good then I guess
Bitmin,it's a pretty well funded department cause it overlaps with so many other ones so I assume they can afford really good ones
Bitmin,"but they're all really good at explaining stuff, have tons of office hours if you need to go in for help, do extra help stuff for tests and exams, have really comprehensive online resources, etc etc etc"
Bitmin,and as good as it is I kinda wish the prof quality was spread a little more evenly cause some profs suuuuuuck
Bitmin,possibly the most frustrating is this one guy who's a top guy in his field (his field is pretty specific) but he just can't teach it for shit
Bitmin,sad
Bitmin,If anyone was wondering
Bitmin,
Bitmin,ABSA IS BAD !?
Bitmin,Every character is close I just think absa is the worst
Bitmin,still totally viable
Bitmin,loud crying
Bitmin,just my opinion

Bitmin,me being wrastor may influence that
Bitmin,YEAH YA THINK?

Bitmin,I'm not good with her tho
Bitmin,oh I see
Bitmin,also airdash cancling is super easy
Bitmin,grumbles
Bitmin,you made it sound impossible
Bitmin,I don't have the fast hands for it
Bitmin,you just input a ground dash
Bitmin,or I'm just doing something wrong mentally
Bitmin,in the air
Bitmin,tap foward twice
Bitmin,then do a move
Bitmin,yes but I can never seem to do it fast enough for the combo to keep going
Bitmin,"maybe it's a tighter window on fortune than whoever you're learning (if it's not fortune I'd assume filia, but if it's fortune then I just don't have the hands for it)"
Bitmin,maybe
Bitmin,I'll have to try whatever combo your doing and see
Bitmin,"I'm probably gonna drop fortune, focus on the parasoul (sure her combo's hard but I think with a bit more practice I'll be able to get it) plus I'm way more comfortable with her neutral and openers"
Bitmin,I do not like fighting characters that outrange me by a significant degree
Bitmin,this is why I need big band
Bitmin,she's basically marth with samus missiles
Bitmin,it's great
Bitmin,so dumb
Bitmin,I did a thing
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I am a totally different person without hair and it's kind of scary
Bitmin,So did i
Bitmin,lol what is that?
Bitmin,Getting stitches soon
Bitmin,No games 4 me
Bitmin,ouch
Bitmin,Yup
Bitmin,wait what happened @Jed
Bitmin,Was working on a model rocket and xacto knife slipped
Bitmin,I cut pretty deep
Bitmin,It was a new blade though so that's nice
Bitmin,yay for not getting tetanus
Bitmin,although an old one might not have cut as deep
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,rip octagon
Bitmin,also wow I never knew what Sylki looked like
Bitmin,Yeet
Bitmin,"Most of my pc parts have been delivered, I'm just waiting on my case and operating system"
Bitmin,"In case anyone was wondering/cared, which, no-one does..."

Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane
Bitmin,Are you prepared to build it
Bitmin,The first one is always scary D:
Bitmin,DONT WORK  ON CARPET DO IT ON A COUNTER
Bitmin,MAKE SURE TO TOUCH THE CASE A LOT TO AVOID STATIC FRYING TF OUT OF YOUR MOTHER BOARD
Bitmin,just use a static grounding glove its not that bad
Bitmin,But thats an extra thing to buy and is annoying
Bitmin,Not really?
Bitmin,subjective.org
Bitmin,already bought one gottem
Bitmin,Nice job kameron
Bitmin,zz
Bitmin,good luck with the PC at least you were gone during my finals week
Bitmin,quick what game are you playin rn
Bitmin,wait actually that was so perfectly timed
Bitmin,this is simulator simulator
Bitmin,renamed it
Bitmin,your card-game?
Bitmin,Kameron is forced to study for his exams in Junior year how about that
Bitmin,its as if Kameron was blessed by the gods
Bitmin,yeah whenever I'm playing nothing it will now say I'm playing my card game instead of simulator simulator

Bitmin,I'm gonna assume this is a joke unless you elaborate
Bitmin,w h a t ? ?
Bitmin,this is most certianly false
Bitmin,lies
Bitmin,this should.... probably be in the memes channel
Bitmin,you think this is a meme?
Bitmin,the probably is there because I'm not sure I wanted to read that regardless of where it was
Bitmin,triggered
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,is Sylki offended
Bitmin,less by the content than the style and the intentional amount of cringe
Bitmin,he tried to take credit for writing that
Bitmin,I did?
Bitmin,no trap
Bitmin,I suck at green texts @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,The only one I tried to write go no comments on 4 chan
Bitmin,:[
Bitmin,you poor soul
Bitmin,Green texts = favorite memes though
Bitmin,I don't really have a general class of favourite meme
Bitmin,my memelord level is insufficient
Bitmin,do you want some edgy memes?
Bitmin,Sure
Bitmin,I want Luke Skywalker level edges

Bitmin,@here
Bitmin,who made this server and can I please become  a master meme
Bitmin,memer
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,why dad
Bitmin,kys
Bitmin,it's fusion's server I think
Bitmin,aye
Bitmin,alright cool
Bitmin,I thought it was chikons
Bitmin,But then I realized he doesnt have the highest tier role
Bitmin,I think old frostbite was
Bitmin,also I'm pretty sure he's a master memer too
Bitmin,:[
Bitmin,also why do you want to be a master memer? what would you do with this untold power?
Bitmin,Nothing I just want to be up there with you guys
Bitmin,:[
Bitmin,the only thing I've used it for is to add the  emote
Bitmin,I would add a meme emote? and monitor the memes channel to ensure safety of users
Bitmin,what meme would you use to encapsulate the entirety of meme-hood?
Bitmin,Holy shit
Bitmin,P.E.P.E
Bitmin,actually
Bitmin,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CekwfI7VL._SX300_QL70_.jpg
Bitmin,All hail the mighty kek
Bitmin,Lord over all memes
Bitmin,what
Bitmin,Praise his name forever on high
Bitmin,This is lord kek
Bitmin,THe mightiest of all memes
Bitmin,He only appears one in every 69^(infinity) memes
Bitmin,I'll reserve judgement and leave it up to fusion
Bitmin,@Zain
Bitmin,I am the highest tier memer here
Bitmin,"also I'm considering changing my tag for smash at least, should I go to Young Irish Stew or Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer?"
Bitmin,Can I have a role that shows up above master memers that has no powers but says master master memers
Bitmin,Y O U N G I R I S H S T E W
Bitmin,! ! !
Bitmin,@everyone I want an opinion
Bitmin,I like Young Irish Stew
Bitmin,Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer is a mouthful
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Yung without an o
Bitmin,just for the meme
Bitmin,"if I do it like that I'd have to shorten every word a bit, I can't thing of a good way to shorten Irish and Stu will make people think that that's my name"
Bitmin,I guess I could do Yung Irish Stoo
Bitmin,but I don't think it's as good
Bitmin,The other name is longer though
Bitmin,How would you shorten it?
Bitmin,probably just to Lermon Squerzer
Bitmin,and the shortening of this one was to have consistency with Yung instead of Young
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane are you done building your comp
Bitmin,@here games?

Bitmin,"no dungeons, supid quest system, terrible story, no cool items, and way too much just wandering around trying to find your next objective"
Bitmin,I think they focused on the open world part way too much
Bitmin,YES
Bitmin,and there's a lot of random grinding for no reason
Bitmin,I hate the fact that it is non linear
Bitmin,it makes it hard to tell a good story and properly scale difficulty
Bitmin,I keep running into enemies that kill me in one hit
Bitmin,why
Bitmin,git gud solved yo problem
Bitmin,did you know that your opinion of open world games is negative does not mean the game is objectively bad
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak chill avec moi
Bitmin,Young Irish Stew is typing...
Bitmin,"For example, what you just described is part of what I like about xenoblade x - they tell you right out the gates that the world is incredibly hostile and you're constantly hearing about people getting attacked and killed by super strong monsters and then it happens to you and you're kinda like ""damn.  Fortunately unlike these sucker npcs I can revive at checkpoints"" and it adds to all the world building"
Bitmin,"Also I can't right now, maybe later tonight"

Bitmin,Gyazo
Bitmin, 
Bitmin,what
Bitmin,I need this next year
Bitmin,I don't remember exactly how it works but if you make an amazon account with a student email you can get free prime
Bitmin,OP
Bitmin,within canada at least
Bitmin,so if any of you non-uni kids in canada want to order stuff off amazon you can probably do it through me (although paying me back would be complicated)
Bitmin,"oh also of note, that free shipping is free ONE-DAY SHIPPING"
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,Yeah just make an account with your student email
Bitmin,free for a whole year
Bitmin,pretty sure I've had it more than a year
Bitmin,really? mine ran out after a year
Bitmin,pretty sure I used it at some point during first year
Bitmin,I dunno

Bitmin,"toronto weather has gone from ""comfortably cool in jeans and a sweatshirt"" to ""sweating in shorts and a tshirt"" overnight"
Bitmin,No kidding
Bitmin,I was dying yesterday
Bitmin,I was kinda hoping it'd be a one day thing but it seems like it's sticking around
Bitmin,I feel no sympathy it's hot here all the time
Bitmin,it's not so bad when you're used to it
Bitmin,if it was this hot during the summer we wouldn't be complaining
Bitmin,but it jumped twenty degrees celsius overnight and that's bullshit
Bitmin,Around here this is basically considered part of summer
Bitmin,We get summer weather from May to October
Bitmin,"in fahrenheit, it went from 50 to 86 overnight"
Bitmin,that's not ok
Bitmin,86 is comforable
Bitmin,I wish I had heat
Bitmin,Comfortable*
Bitmin,"86 is slightly too hot, but when you're not used to it it's brutal"
Bitmin,also it's super humid
Bitmin,Ideal to me is 78
Bitmin,What humidity number is it?
Bitmin,69%
Bitmin,It's even worse when your AC isn't on
Bitmin,ahahaha our AC's semi busted so it doesn't get everywhere in the house
Bitmin,Okay I feel sorry for you guys now no ac is rough
Bitmin,Rip
Bitmin,fans have become a crucial commodity
Bitmin,I'm so tired
Bitmin,I fell asleep at like 3 last night
Bitmin,So I drank a monster and i was good for a whilr
Bitmin,But now I am tired again
Bitmin,I'd say my perfect temperatures are 22 (72ish) or 13 (55ish) depending on what I'm doing
Bitmin,also ouch
Bitmin,just force yourself to stay up as long as you can
Bitmin,Monsters are death in a bottle I would advise against drinking them
Bitmin,Nah
Bitmin,eh energy drinks are only bad if you drink like 5
Bitmin,I mean I don't drink them every day
Bitmin,admittadly I've never had energy drinks but so long as you don't go crazy with how many you drink and develop a dependancy you're fine
Bitmin,same with coffee
Bitmin,I know someone who drinks an energy drink every day and he just went to the dentist and apparently he has a cavity in every tooth
Bitmin,"when my mum was in college she also worked a night shift, and they had a coffee machine with free coffee and one day she realized that she couldn't function without 13 cups of coffee"
Bitmin,If I have lot of work to do sometimes I will get a drink with 6 shots of espresso 
Bitmin,Little bit Overkill but it does the job
Bitmin,I can stay up super late and focus with no assistance from coffee or monsters
Bitmin,You also don't go to school
Bitmin,Being social take a lot of energy
Bitmin,"Patch Notes For 1.3

Bitmin,The biggest MCG update yet
Bitmin,2 new pages of cards
Bitmin,"I can focus late without caffeine or energy drinks, but not for more than two, maybe three days in a row"
Bitmin,also Octagon feeling the introvert struggle
Bitmin,I feel your pain
Bitmin,I'm not even an introvert
Bitmin,It's just that being social is a lot of work
Bitmin,that's the actual definition of introverted
Bitmin,you can be a super social introvert
Bitmin,it just takes a ton of your energy
Bitmin,wanna play games?
Bitmin,@here
Bitmin,maybe later tonight
Bitmin,@everyone Looking for beta testers for MCG 1.3 on tabletop simulator!

Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane
Bitmin,Can I get help with one permutations problem
Bitmin,@everyone
Bitmin,In how many orders can four students be lined up against a wall if there are six to choose from
Bitmin,that makes no sense
Bitmin,I think 6P4
Bitmin,360?
Bitmin,it's been awhile since I did permutations and combinations
Bitmin,im so confused fml
Bitmin,I think its 360
Bitmin,"l;'kadfs;'klafds'lk;fkasd;'lk;l'afdsl;'kkl;'fadslk;'dfaskl;'rewqoip[reqwio[preqwio[prqewio[preqw[iopreqwio[pvcxzm,./cvxzmn.,cvzxnm,.zcvxnm.,zvc"
Bitmin,if I remember correctly it's 6P4
Bitmin,if that's an option on your calculator
Bitmin,thats the equation for permuations taken at a time
Bitmin,there should be an nPr thing
Bitmin,tell me if it ends up at 360
Bitmin,I don't think it's going to
Bitmin,it doesn't matter that they're taken all at once
Bitmin,it'd be the same thing if you picked one at a time
Bitmin,I'm 95% sure it's just 6P4
Bitmin,"(which actually is 360, either max is a god or he just plugged it in)"
Bitmin,I did not use a calculator
Bitmin,I did it in my head
Bitmin,actually not true
Bitmin,but I didn't use a P function
Bitmin,I'm gonna assume you know the full formula for it tho?
Bitmin,its 6x5x4x3
Bitmin,easy
Bitmin,suddenly realizes I've been using the overcomplicated version for if you have repeated elements
Bitmin,goddamn it higher education for making me forget about simple solutions to stuff
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,figured out why my ping was bad
Bitmin,I have 2 exchange students staying at my house
Bitmin,and they are both simultaneously using their phones and laptops
Bitmin,gg
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,dumb chinese people
Bitmin,jk
Bitmin,Does anyone here think its normal to call your friends by their last name?
Bitmin,I think first name is more friendly so yeah last name is a little wierd
Bitmin,why?
Bitmin,someone is trying to convince me it is normal but nAH
Bitmin,I want opinions of people who arent homeschool though
Bitmin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gia6en2R0Q&feature=youtu.be I heard you guys like sick tracer highlights
Bitmin,sick tracer highlight
Bitmin,we still lost that push and the game :)
Bitmin,we still lost that push though and the game 
Bitmin,It is normal in some culture
Bitmin,And I'm sure if ur name is something hard to say like Uvuvwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwembubwem Ossas then people would probably call you by urn last name
Bitmin,Some of my friends call me by my last name occasionally
Bitmin,@Feral Nebula it can be used kinda like a nickname
Bitmin,Like you don't always call the by their last name
Bitmin,But sometimes
Bitmin,I think we need a wall between China and the us
Bitmin,it very much depends on the person
Bitmin,"it's rare, but some people prefer last name or middle name to first name"
Bitmin,there was a guy at my elementary school who everyone called Mac and I didn't learn until grade 4 that that wasn't his actual name
Bitmin,Our school have a guy we call max but that isn't his realy name
Bitmin,also a lot of asian kids have a legal name and a given name and would much prefer if you used the given one
Bitmin,"for example, I have a friend whose actual name is Xenswe, but we all just call him Ben"
Bitmin,(might be a bit off on the spelling it's been awhile since I've actually seen it)
Bitmin,It happens a lot in sports too. Probably because your last name is what's on all of your stuff
Bitmin,also in sports some people's last names are just so clearly better than their first names
Bitmin,like Stan Warinka
Bitmin,@waowder csgo?
Bitmin,Aren't you in school
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,we had a test today
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,play with us too
Bitmin,I'm sorta in school though
Bitmin,What is up my dudes
Bitmin,Does anyone here find shoulders to be sexy or distracting
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,lol no
Bitmin,literally no one does
Bitmin,my high school was HILARIOUS(ly dumb) about it tho
Bitmin,"Can't wear: Shirt that exposes your shoulders or stomach
Can wear: Shirt that exposes a solid 50% of your boobs"
Bitmin,"I mean if you're gonna bring up the whole distraction thing, boobs are clearly way more distracting than shoulders"
Bitmin,They tried to send me home
Bitmin,"but even then, NO ONE IS ACTUALLY IGNORING CLASS TO STARE AT PEOPLE"
Bitmin,Wait they tried to send you home because you were exposing your shoulders?
Bitmin,wait they tried to send YOU home for exposing your shoulders?
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,your a dude
Bitmin,WAIT WHAT
Bitmin,why
Bitmin,hahahaha
Bitmin,Yup
Bitmin,that's amazing
Bitmin,thats so dumb
Bitmin,your school is a trainwreck
Bitmin,like are you just wearing a tank top?
Bitmin,Apparently 2 teachers told the office person that I was wearing a tank top
Bitmin,Like come on don't be a little bitch just dress code me yourself
Bitmin,Sorry I am a little heated
Bitmin,I mean I totally would be to
Bitmin,dress code is dumb enough already
Bitmin,the shoulders thing is even dumber
Bitmin,but I've literally never heard of a GUY getting dresscoded for shoulders
Bitmin,"""oh no his sculpted physique is distracting the class"""
Bitmin,wait octagon showed his shoulders in school what a slut
Bitmin,Ha
Bitmin,I know I'm a whore
Bitmin,But get this
Bitmin,Girls are allowed to wear tank tops
Bitmin,you should have told them it's within your rights to embrace your physical attractiveness
Bitmin,WAIT WHAT
Bitmin,Yup
Bitmin,why is your school so dumb
Bitmin,Do you understand my frustration now
Bitmin,thats so wierd
Bitmin,I mean I understood it before
Bitmin,but it just keeps getting worse
Bitmin,WHAT IS YOUR SCHOOL
Bitmin,凸( •̀_•́ )凸
Bitmin,Who knows
Bitmin,"in general, I would say either have no dress code whatsoever or do uniforms, don't half-ass it"
Bitmin,"and yeah, uniforms kinda suck but there are arguments to be made for it, and most places would just not have a dress code"
Bitmin,but god damn your school actually sounds like it has the worst implemented dress code I've ever heard of
Bitmin,Yes it also is dependent on if the office people like you or not
Bitmin,@Bitmin @Zain trio queue?
Bitmin,oh well that's always how this sort of thing works
Bitmin,
Bitmin,That's what I'm wearing
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,Basically a slut
Bitmin,And the only reason I wore the tank top is cause nothing else goes with these shorts
Bitmin,Pretty much
Bitmin,Yall are nerds
Bitmin,Also fuck torque
Bitmin,wait am gonna restart my router

Bitmin,if you want a good team at least

Bitmin,I basically get to design my courses for the first year or so before picking what I want
Bitmin,cool
Bitmin,You have to pick something that you're going to enjoy doing in the future
Bitmin,So keep that in mind I guess
Bitmin,That was the main reason I decided I probably shouldn't do a science job because I don't really enjoy doing math and I don't want that to be my job
Bitmin,What type of business do you want?
Bitmin,business management I think
Bitmin,don't have to decide the specific type until year 3
Bitmin,That's pretty cool
Bitmin,but the general look of the course seems like something I would enjoy and be good at more than the engineering degrees I was looking at before
Bitmin,Mine is the same
Bitmin,It is the same in that the specific doesn't come until year 3?
Bitmin,"Yeah, I have until year 3 to declare a major"
Bitmin,But I can do it whenever
Bitmin,Anniversary event

Bitmin,and the other team isn't letting me play cause I have silver experience from two years ago
Bitmin,"welp I just rang for a team, and I knew they sucked, but damn they just kicked their roamer cause he didn't know how to rocket jump"

Bitmin,why does it cost so much to attend GOML?
Bitmin,venue fee mostly
Bitmin,wow thats a big venue fee
Bitmin,"$45 for three days of venue fee, twenty dollars for two events, tax"
Bitmin,the venue fee at TGC the biggest tournament I ever went to was like $5
Bitmin,"it's pretty rare to see more than 5-10, but I'm not surprised it's more for a major"
Bitmin,"they have to cover the venue somehow, and I'm sure booking somewhere this big for a whole weekend isn't cheap"
Bitmin,Done with finals and got a 100% on my last one
Bitmin,noice noice
Bitmin,also do you already have your marks back or was it just that easy?

Bitmin,@everyone Question 6 is up
Bitmin,Who is the person who answered ambidextrous?
Bitmin,"@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Any opinions before I officially change the cards?            Patch Notes For 1.4 
Necromancer- Cost reduced from 4>3. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 1 creature at night was removed. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 2 creatures was restricted to night time only. 
Poison Pump- Name changed to Catapult.
Soldier- HP decreased from 4>2
Barbarian- HP decreased from 2>1
Tribesman- Attack decreased from 2>1
Field Medic- Attack increased from 0>2
Break- Added effect “If this card is countered shuffle it into your deck instead of discarding it.”
Counterspell- You now lose 3 life if you play counterspell by sending a card to the void.
 Extract- The player who played extract now chooses which card gets discarded.
Banish- Added effect “You may not have more than 2 banishes in play at a time”.
Knight- HP increased from 3>4.
Spearman- HP increased from 3>4 Attack decreased from 2>1 Damage dealt by ability increased from 3>4.
Stasis Chamber- HP increased from 2>3
Sage- Cost increased from 1>2 Ability changed to “When Sage destroys a creature or damages a player you may add a spell or instant costing 2 or less to your hand”. Rather than playing the card for free and shuffling it back into your deck.
Zombie- HP increased from 1>2 Attack decreased from 3>2. Now only resurrects if you pay 1 resource.
Thundersurge- HP of creatures killed decreased from 3>1 cost decreased from 3>2.
Dig- HP gained by opponent decreased from 2>1.
Sword- Attack gained by equipped creature increased from 3>4."
Bitmin,I was fond of old necromancer but I think that's why he's getting nerfed
Bitmin,old necromancer was OP
Bitmin,"I don't think soldier was all that good, maybe do 4->3 instead, cause otherwise he's almost too squishy (and you've not got that many cards with more than two hp)"
Bitmin,18/27 of my creatures have more than 2 HP
Bitmin,"one necromancer tweak I think would be interesting would be something like you have to sacrifice creatures such that the total health of your sacrificed stuff equals the number of resources you'd need to summon the thing you're bringing back, and maybe half that during the night, cause I liked that aspect of him"
Bitmin,join voice if you can
Bitmin,so basically you can drop a creature with only two health left to summon one that would require 2 resource to summon
Bitmin,I can't
Bitmin,there are two reasons I didn't do that
Bitmin,also I don't think barb/tribesman were OP
Bitmin,1 is there isn't enough room on the card to describe such an effect
Bitmin,2 is that creatures with high attack on low HP would be to good with it
Bitmin,how so?
Bitmin,"you're not doing health -> health, you're doing health -> effective resources"
Bitmin,oh in that case wall would make that super OP
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,didn't think of that
Bitmin,I think the counterspell nerf is unecessary
Bitmin,me neither
Bitmin,also I haven't played with or against a bunch of the cards you're tweaking so I'll leave those up to you
Bitmin,I'm considering how to make necromancer more interesting in the future but for now I just wanted him to not be OP so we can use him
Bitmin,he is one of the more unique cards
Bitmin,also I vote changing the name of poison pump to swarm
Bitmin,ooh I like that
Bitmin,thats good
Bitmin,I'll use that
Bitmin,cool-cool my work here is done
Bitmin,I think I'm going to reduce the nerf to soldier and counterspell
Bitmin,I like the extract change
Bitmin,but doesn't it mean that you see the other person's hand? or you just pick randomly?
Bitmin,New changes Soldier- HP reduced from 4>3 Counterspell- Lose 2 HP instead of 3 as I plannned before
Bitmin,you see the other persons hand
Bitmin,I feel like that makes it really good then
Bitmin,not as good as before
Bitmin,it used to be unquestionably the best card in the game
Bitmin,and it controlled the meta
Bitmin,then I nerfed it so hard that no one has really used it since
Bitmin,I'm trying something new in the hopes that extract will become a good but not OP card
Bitmin,getting ready for that extract banish combos tho
Bitmin,oh I didn't think of that
Bitmin,now I'm glad I nerfed banish a little
Bitmin,rip my cool ideas
Bitmin,having half of your deck be dead is an unwinnable position
Bitmin,also your idea still works
Bitmin,"yeah, if you can get both in your starting hand that is really good"
Bitmin,Patch 1.5 might include new cards. If so you guys can recommend some ideas for them.
Bitmin,time to start working on my storm cycle deck which I will of course be calling storm warning
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,@Rotomotorz league
Bitmin,dude... wall + sword = op?
Bitmin,maybe
Bitmin,wall fury was a deck in the original version of my game
Bitmin,nice
Bitmin,Also I forget a patch note
Bitmin,Archives- Added effect “You may not use this ability on cards that can be recasted”
Bitmin,MCG V1.4 is now live!
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane I made a storm warning deck
Bitmin,but I was gonna do that tho
Bitmin,you can also do one
Bitmin,k
Bitmin,I just wanted to see the different designes we could come up with
Bitmin,"did you use like scout, dig, visions, wall and stuff"
Bitmin,some but not all of those
Bitmin,cool-cool
Bitmin,My deck can be reduced to I think 4 cards
Bitmin,all others banished
Bitmin,although that may not be necessary
Bitmin,nice dude
Bitmin,we can test it later
Bitmin,"as in like, a different day, I'm bouta go to sleep"
Bitmin,Cool card idea: Watch 3 (Equipment)- Target creature exists in its own time which can be chosen and changed at any time by whoever controls the Watch.
Bitmin,I like it

Bitmin,"also an unrelated question for all you americans, do ketchup chips actually not exist in the states?"
Bitmin,i have no idea what a ketchup chip is
Bitmin,nah i'm pretty sure ketchup chips are just a canada thing
Bitmin,I don't even like ketchup chips but I cannot imagine them not existing
Bitmin,like
Bitmin,"literally any time anyone is getting chips for a party or something, you can't NOT bring ketchup chips cause someone there is going to love them"
Bitmin,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Bitmin,17 quadrillian degrees dude
Bitmin,Is it a ketchup flavored chip?
Bitmin,nah it's chip flavored ketchup
Bitmin,yeah there's like a ketchup powder thing on it
Bitmin,that feel when you remember bitmins name used to be bitshock
Bitmin,WHAT
Bitmin,I THOUGHT THOSE WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
Bitmin,well it took the temperature going up to 34 for my family to turn on the AC but at this point I'm just glad it's on
Bitmin,(also for you americans that's like 93 fahrenheit)
Bitmin,It's supposed to get that hot in a few days where I am
Bitmin,And I'm excited
Bitmin,I love hot weather
Bitmin,this is too hot for anything other than going to the beach
Bitmin,ideal temperature is 15-22
Bitmin,(basically 60-70)
Bitmin,I prefer between 70-80
Bitmin,that's probably the second best range
Bitmin,"also -10 to 0 is pretty nice for winter stuff, cause there's still snow but it's not actually all that cold"
Bitmin,We rarely get snow FeelsBadMan
Bitmin,Though we did this year and schools were closed multiple days for like 3 inches
Bitmin,lololol if canadian schools closed for three inches we'd be off from like mid december till mid march
Bitmin,with a few weirdly warm days in the middle
Bitmin,@Jed I'm at a lake so we can use our boat
Bitmin,"USA and  Canada World Cup teams will be revealed this Thursday at E3 at 5 PM PST, will play against each other in showmatch"

Bitmin,I was driving through LA yesterday
Bitmin,And I realized 2 things
Bitmin,1. Driving in big cities sucks balls
Bitmin,2. E3 is happening in LA this week
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane meme with me
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,pls
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,y
Bitmin,how could you
Bitmin,ur not a tur fren
Bitmin,tru*
Bitmin,not on computer
Bitmin,So???
Bitmin,I'm sulking
Bitmin,meme on phone then
Bitmin,too busy sulking
Bitmin,lameo
Bitmin,"He got dumped ok, let him sulk in peace"
Bitmin,can't spell kameron without name
Bitmin,cuz his name is trah lmao gg
Bitmin,i cry
Bitmin,and also sulk
Bitmin,that too
Bitmin,shulk?
Bitmin,monando
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,nintendo's presentation kinda sucked btw
Bitmin,did we get anything on xenoblade 2?
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,some anime trailers
Bitmin,no gameplay really
Bitmin,E3 was pretty lacking this year
Bitmin,agreed
Bitmin,suddenly remembers that a) I don't have a switch and b) they're like $600 and c) I don't have $600 to spend on a switch
Bitmin,nothing was really stand out in any of the presentations
Bitmin,My friend just got one today
Bitmin,He went to ebgames during lunch and they had 3 in stock
Bitmin,naisu
Bitmin,still not worth tho
Bitmin,no games
Bitmin,also he should sell it and profit
Bitmin,And it was only ~$550 including Zelda
Bitmin,kameron they have a 40 minute xenoblade gameplay video
Bitmin,that is a lot of gameplay
Bitmin,that's not the presentation bruh
Bitmin,and goddamn it they kept the main character's hella dumb design
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,the game is honestly pretty ugly
Bitmin,man is wearing hollow harem pants with short shorts under them
Bitmin,why
Bitmin,also yeah it doesn't look great
Bitmin,like ps2.5 graphics
Bitmin,literally looks worse than x
Bitmin,which has the terrifying uncanny valley people
Bitmin,"looks almost as bad as the original, but they don't really compensate with cool looking stuff"
Bitmin,"but the environments just aren't great in this one, and sure the stylization for the characters means they don't look bad graphically, but they just look awful aesthetically"
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,also the fuck is that girls bust
Bitmin,I'm 95% that's not how boobs work
Bitmin,what are you some kinda doctah?
Bitmin,remembers Fiora and Sharla and basically every female character other than Melia ok I guess that's always kinda been there
Bitmin,doctor ur supposed to respond because I mentioned medical professionals
Bitmin,starts watching the trailer THAT IS THE CHRONO TRIGGER OPENING YOU JUST STOLE
Bitmin,after a brief double check it's the same composer so I guess it's fine
Bitmin,also HYPE it's the same composer as chrono trigger
Bitmin,I have not been super hyped for a game and then actually liked the game in such a long time
Bitmin,last game may have been rivals of aether
Bitmin,literally after looking at what they have to show the only thing I'm hyped for in xenoblade2 is the soundtrack
Bitmin,also the boat is still broken rip
Bitmin,seriously the world looks pretty awful and the character design is actually horrible
Bitmin,"I swear to god the previous games have so many good character designs (if occasionally poor implementation cause meh graphics), and then SERIOUSLY WHAT IS THIS SHIT https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/e/ee/Switch_XenobladeChronicles2_E32017_character_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20170613180929"
Bitmin,I left my computer ok man
Bitmin,DO YOU REALLY NEED ALL THOSE BELTS
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,Those belts aren't even holding anything
Bitmin,Except for the one around his waist
Bitmin,"and the main female character is made of fanservice - super skinny, giant boobs, basically no clothing, and shorts so short they barely even qualify as shorts"
Bitmin,thats just sad
Bitmin,I mean there's always been a bit of fanservice in this series but that's taking it up a few too many levels
Bitmin,they're basically at the level before kill la kill and THAT SHIT WAS A PARODY OF OVERDONE FANSERVICE
Bitmin,I'm ok witht eh guy design but the pyra girl whatever is a little much
Bitmin,"that also somehow managed to slip some actual good character designs in around the fanservice, which xenoblade 2 is very much not"
Bitmin,"I was kinda hoping they'd do something about the characters after the first trailer came out way back when and everyone kinda went ""wow those characters look terrible"" but nope"
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Bitmin,"on the plus side, unless they pull their shit together I no longer have a reason to drop $600 on a switch"
Bitmin,Splatoon 2?
Bitmin,Mario Odyssey?
Bitmin,Kirby Switch?
Bitmin,FE Switch?
Bitmin,can we talk about mario oddesssy for a second
Bitmin,Arms?
Bitmin,arms is bad
Bitmin,Metroid 4?
Bitmin,the free trial was 0 fun
Bitmin,and how fucking bizzare a cartoonish character looks in a moderately (or at least anatomically accurate) world?
Bitmin,But it doesnt even look that bad
Bitmin,I'm not sold on it
Bitmin,it's a pretty clashing visual style
Bitmin,"both can work well on their own, but together it's just weird"
Bitmin,it'd be like anime characters showing up in american cartoons
Bitmin,also why does nintendo keep making dynasty warriors style games
Bitmin,"sure hyrule warriors was kind of a cult classic but I feel like a lot of that was people following the LoZ train, and they're kinda boned doing it with series with smaller fanbases"
Bitmin,Fire Emblem has a respectable fanbase
Bitmin,"Fire Emblem, sure, but why are they making a Fate/ one? no one actually likes anything other than the animes and the vn"
Bitmin,they'll lose it if they only have awakening fates and marth so
Bitmin,"lol ""respectable fanbase"""
Bitmin,maybe if they added some of the other games
Bitmin,it'll probably still sell fine with just awakefates + marth
Bitmin,I mean they got a decently spread cast for heroes (sure it's pretty skewed but at least they got SOME from other games)
Bitmin,Lmao these Splat Tim memes are so good
Bitmin,huh?
Bitmin,In the splatoon tournament at E3
Bitmin,Tim is a us memeber who got like a 3v1 doubel
Bitmin,and now the chat memes whenever he does something
Bitmin,he's not even the best player on the US team but he's a good meme
Bitmin,(I know nothing about splatoon but that seems cool)
Bitmin,oh boy the US won
Bitmin,does this mean the US is finally good at an esport lmao
Bitmin,@Rotomotorz league
Bitmin,Actually
Bitmin,looking at Pyra she's not much worse than fiora
Bitmin,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,kys
Bitmin,will do budy
Bitmin,am not your buddy pal
Bitmin,am not your pal buddy
Bitmin,your not my friend unfriended on bnet get fucked lil bitch
Bitmin,oh......
Bitmin,com'on man that was too far...
Bitmin,good god the final mission of xenoblade x is hard
Bitmin,I mean I might be like 5 levels lower than the boss I'm trying to fight but still
Bitmin,I keep knocking off most of his health and getting so damn close and then he kills me
Bitmin,"fuck you, fat man in a large mech"
Bitmin,"FUCK IT I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW A FEW LEVELS HIGHER AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHOSE BIRTHRIGHT IS PAIN, ASSHOLE"
Bitmin,lol someone is a little upset
Bitmin,bastard has so much health
Bitmin,and he keeps spawning stuff that has lots of health
Bitmin,and then he goes invincible AND REGENS HIS HEALTH
Bitmin,AND THEN SPAWNS MORE THINGS
Bitmin,wow that sounds terrible to play against
Bitmin,I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S THE FINAL BOSS I'M ONLY ON PART 3/5 OF THE MISSION
Bitmin,also it's actually a pretty fun fight
Bitmin,but I'm really feeling the AI handicap
Bitmin,I feel like if somehow I could have three additional humans handling my party members I could win this fight
Bitmin,Is that possible?
Bitmin,nope
Bitmin,but hey at least the ai's not as bad as in the original
Bitmin,and at least the music's hella badass
Bitmin,@Rotomotorz league?
Bitmin,sure hold up i'm patching
Bitmin,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch

Bitmin,congrats
Bitmin,also there was a twist where I had almost the right idea and I'm so mad
Bitmin,I almost predicted it
Bitmin,my logic was so almost but not quite correct
Bitmin,was it a good game?
Bitmin,yee
Bitmin,"definately have some issues with the game, but overall good"
Bitmin,(also I'm hella nitpicky so most of the issues are pretty minor)
Bitmin,Going to attend the MCG conference tomorrow?
Bitmin,probably yeah

Bitmin,also I swear they saved like all the best songs for the last little bit
Bitmin,pre-final boss - awesome music
Bitmin,final boss - awesome music

Bitmin,credits theme - damn good
Bitmin,"most of the rest of the game - occasional scattered good songs here and there but the ones you hear a lot (normal battle theme, hub area, etc) kinda crappy"
Bitmin,aw really you're gonna end it on another twist and leave some stuff totally unexplained
Bitmin,dammit
Bitmin,you'd better make a fucking sequel
Bitmin,that looks better than xenoblade2
Bitmin,Still a good game

Bitmin,"I mean they have an actual full-time job and stuff, this is just for a side thing they're doing"

A blooperberry

Bitmin,What is a smokers favorite kind of berry?
Bitmin,A rasp-berry
Bitmin,oh my god
Bitmin,I am the pun king
Bitmin,@Zain can I make a daily pun text channel?
Bitmin,sure
Bitmin,NICE
Bitmin,Oh I forgot to say last night about the Your Eternal Reward that your cloak drains 50% faster
Bitmin,@Max @Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,wow that's awful
Bitmin,I mean no one used it anyway
Bitmin,but why encourage people to not use it even more
Bitmin,That's what I'm saying
Bitmin,I like how it is now
Bitmin,"It's supposed to be a fun gimmick, not a viable weapon"
Bitmin,@here ovahwatch???
Bitmin,@Bitmin @Zain
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane level up that alt man
Bitmin,mmmmk
Bitmin,Rip computer
Bitmin,IM DECAYING :[
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane @Zain 6 wins and 2 losses so far in my placements.
Bitmin,I think my mother board is dead
Bitmin,wow that sucks
Bitmin,didn't you just get a new computer
Bitmin,Well it isn't new
Bitmin,The motherboard was still stock
Bitmin,And had been used somewhat
Bitmin,@Bitmin 5 mins
Bitmin,oh shit I though the life is strange sale was $5 per chapter but it's $5 for the whole thing
Bitmin,I MUST GET IT
Bitmin,that is cheap
Bitmin,"Did you paly the demo, Quick?"
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,I still haven't finished the demo but I'm liking what I've seen so far (and yes I know that wasn't directed at me)
Bitmin,but 5 dollars for the whole thing is worth it
Bitmin,"it's on sale till the 5th, give the demo a shot first"
Bitmin,"Also by demo, it's actually the full first episode"
Bitmin,Also I got a Switch today!
Bitmin,
Bitmin,cool-cool
Bitmin,nice nice
Bitmin,SYLKI HOW DARE YOU STEAL MY SAYING AFFIRMATIVE WORDS TWICE THING
Bitmin,thats my thing
Bitmin,I SAY NICE NICE ALL THE TIME
Bitmin,THATS A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Bitmin,YOU'RE A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Bitmin,THATS NOT VERY NICE NICE TO SAY
Bitmin,also code geass is really good
Bitmin,yeeee
Bitmin,how far are you?
Bitmin,curently on episode 15
Bitmin,and the code geass binge continues
Bitmin,it's impossible to not binge your first time through
Bitmin,feelsbadman?
Bitmin,I watched the whole thing in four days
Bitmin,both seasons?
Bitmin,and the first 46 episodes in 3
Bitmin,yeah the whole thing
Bitmin,wait how many seasons are there?
Bitmin,just two right?
Bitmin,just the two
Bitmin,c2 is confusing
Bitmin,they're doing a third but there's a decent chance it's just a cash grab cause apparently the studio's not doing so well and it does seem odd that they'd suddenly rejuvinate the series like 9 years later
Bitmin,WOW CHIKON YOURE SUCH A WEEABOO
Bitmin,yur bad at overwatch
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,at least I'm not a filthy weeb
Bitmin,OH WAIT XDDDD
Bitmin,yeah I was gonna say
Bitmin,you have an animoo profile picture
Bitmin,shhh
Bitmin,we dont talk about that
Bitmin,at least you're not like the closet weeb from kingston
Bitmin,"apparently, changing his tag to Kaneki ""wasn't a weeb thing or anything"""
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,"but at the moment his profile picture is Rem from re zero and that whole ""not a weeb thing"" is looking even less plausible than before"
Bitmin,he just needs to accept it
Bitmin,being a weeb is fun
Bitmin,hear hear
Bitmin,"(don't kill me kameron, hear hear is a thing that needs to go twice)"
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,YOU SHALL BE PUBLICALLY EXECUTED SYLKI FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST MY IDIOSYNCRASIES
Bitmin,OBJECTION!
Bitmin,you can't make me
Bitmin,"also, @Mr. Airplane @The Rona @Rotomotorz you guys want to try starting the race over tonight?"
Bitmin,Maybe
Bitmin,If I'm not caught up playing Zelda :L
Bitmin,Maybe as well

Bitmin,That's what happens every game in masters
Bitmin,@Zain
Bitmin,Can you review a vod for me later
Bitmin,Im uploading it to youtube and could really use some feedback on this particular loss 
Bitmin,sure
Bitmin,@Zain
Bitmin,"Thank you im uploading it now. I played mostly mcree, but threw in some stall heroes at the end"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,@everyone
Bitmin,so close to my season high
Bitmin,Oh wait this belongs in the memes channel
Bitmin,@everyone i lent trap my adblocker account and he won feelzgoodman
Bitmin,Feels good man
Bitmin,"don't know if anyone here still plays fe heroes but the voting thing is crazy close - they're apart by ~1.2 million points, which seems like a lot execpt that the scores are both almost thirty BILLION"
Bitmin,aka they differ by 0.012%
Bitmin,voting on what?
Bitmin,it's basically waifu wars
Bitmin,"(this time at least, normally it's not JUST girls)"
Bitmin,who are the two characters being voted on?
Bitmin,this time around it was basically who's the best healer character and it's ended up narrowed down to elise and priscilla
Bitmin,and given that I never used priscilla in fe7 I'm backing elise
Bitmin,we're down 1.2 million
Bitmin,So your supposed to vote on character strength?
Bitmin,naw just how much you like the character
Bitmin,So even if one is clearly better you could still vote for the other just because you like them better?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,also all the healers kinda suck in this game
Bitmin,so you're not really voting for whoever's the strongest
Bitmin,and while you do get slightly better prizes if you win it's not really that significant
Bitmin,i am confirmed masters player
Bitmin,Just got signed on with envyus\

Bitmin,I remember when he died I had two thoughts. #1 Hooray a dangerous terrorist is dead. #2 Oh darn this will make Obama look good (I think the election was soon to occur).
Bitmin,is making Obama look good a bad thing?
Bitmin,I wanted him out
Bitmin,why?
Bitmin,because his political opinions didnt align with his
Bitmin,Too many reasons to explain in text but to put it simply I am a Republican and he is not so why wouldn't I want him out.
Bitmin,I mean being a Republican doesn't mean you have to dislike a Democratic nominee.
Bitmin,A nominee which I disagree with on 90%+ of issues is not going to have my support.
Bitmin,^^^
Bitmin,truth
Bitmin,Well what did you not agree with him on?
Bitmin,nearly everything
Bitmin,Remember the part where he said there was too much to explain over text
Bitmin,^^^
Bitmin,"also I wasn't trying to disprove your statement, just bringling light to the fact that the ""He's Democrat i'm Republican"" thing doesn't hold much weight on it's own"

Bitmin,@everyone
Bitmin,ava gets all the credit for the business cards
Bitmin,100% royalty to her

Bitmin,@Trapezoider

Bitmin,time to spam andrew with voicemails
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,do it
Bitmin,you won't
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,already did it
Bitmin,I just had the dumbest shift of my life
Bitmin,shift was 300-530
Bitmin,"I get paid by the delivery, and no one orders food during that time period"
Bitmin,normally I'd get two or three deliveries for that
Bitmin,"I got one delivery, and I had to wait till 445"
Bitmin,wow that sucks
Bitmin,delivery fee - $7
Bitmin,tip - $21
Bitmin,I'll take it
Bitmin,"so basically I sat around for two hours, worked for twenty minutes, made almost $30"
Bitmin,sounds like a weird job
Bitmin,like not profitable very much
Bitmin,or am I wrong?
Bitmin,yeah it's super not profitable
Bitmin,"it pays well per hour, especially if you can get a dinner shift (530-830 is suuuuch a good shift to get), but there aren't many shifts"
Bitmin,seriously the 530-830 pays about $20 an hour

Bitmin,@Master Memers we should get more dude Bros in here
Bitmin,why though
Bitmin,IDK
Bitmin,Why does hyp keep getting kicked
Bitmin,He doesn't do anything wrong
Bitmin,because no one likes him
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,Mrd do you like hype
Bitmin,"To me, it seems like he doesn't care about us. Maybe? Dunno."
Bitmin,No he likes being in here. He really wants to be involved
Bitmin,that's too bad
Bitmin,Who keeps kicking him?
Bitmin,he is banned
Bitmin,Really?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,fusion was the one who kicked him the first time and trap invited him back
Bitmin,I honestly have no clue.
Bitmin,Why is he banned
Bitmin,What did he do
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,I did have one experience where he just joins a channel other people are in and just leaves.
Bitmin,I do that
Bitmin,Maybe invite him back and ask him
Bitmin,"And if he gives a valid reason, ban him again, unless you hate him"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Okay okay point taken!
Bitmin,it was agreed upon by many people to ban him
Bitmin,so it stands
Bitmin,I didn't hear about that so I didn't know.
Bitmin,Nah
Bitmin,That's not valid there wasn't a vote
Bitmin,When fusion gets back we're taking a vote
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,max is admin
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,For now
Bitmin,Then ask him
Bitmin,I will talk to Fusion about this when he gets back for now I will drop it
Bitmin,4 of the master memers agreed
Bitmin,fusion kicked him in the first place
Bitmin,4 out of 8
Bitmin,That's not even a majority
Bitmin,"(for the record I just kinda shrugged my shoulders and didn't vote, but I'm not against it, I can see why he rubs a lot of people the wrong way)"
Bitmin,and the others don't even know him
Bitmin,That doesn't include the other members
Bitmin,"also let's be fair, smithy and bitmin are hardly around, fusion's gone and left max in charge"
Bitmin,"All I'm saying is when fusion gets back, I'm going to ask to have this reconsidered"
Bitmin,"He's my friend, and I really like having him around"
Bitmin,That is all
Bitmin,/End
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,private calls are a thing
Bitmin,who knew
Bitmin,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitmin,/End
Bitmin,"Who knew, weaponized autism is a thing that infects over 69 million 8 sided shapes a year"
Bitmin,༼ つ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ  that's where you're wrong kiddo
Bitmin,aight if this keeps devolving into throwing shit at each other I'm gonna have to request that you just do it in pms
Bitmin,when you lose control of a situation it automatically shoots to insults huh
Bitmin,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Bitmin,I'm done
Bitmin,also I realize I could have done a sick pun with pms and PMs but I wasted the opportunity
Bitmin,dang
Bitmin,"""If you guys are gonna go all PMS on each other I'd appreciate if you did it through PMs"""
Bitmin,boom
Bitmin,what a missed opportunity
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,I'm not the one who started with a bad attitude about this. Also okay @Sak von Sak I'll move this so I don't end up bannerinod
Bitmin,"wasn't a threat, just a request so we don't clog the chat with you two having a discussion mostly meant for each other"

Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,newt films?
Bitmin,one of the things I love about one of the webcomics I'm reading is that everyone who reads it has been conditioned to it being depressing so that any time something nice happens we all get really scared
Bitmin,even though nothing particularly bad has happened for like five chapters (of seven)
Bitmin,but you can't just kill off half the cast two chapters in and not expect people to be constantly nervous
Bitmin,@Jed thank you yes
Bitmin,yeah boi

Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,The feeling when you skip your families arbitrary religious weekly ceremony of church so your parents unplug the router and lock the door leaving you home alone without internet
Bitmin,But then you discover you have an lte hotspot your pc can connect to
Bitmin,Feelsgoodman
Bitmin,Can't you just plug the router back in?
Bitmin,The door to the router is locked
Bitmin,I don't know where the key is
Bitmin,:(
Bitmin,Use a Bobby pin
Bitmin,How tho
Bitmin,Is it ez
Bitmin,??
Bitmin,It's just one of those little hole locks right?
Bitmin,Ye I think so
Bitmin,Lemme check
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,I used to do that all the time as a kid
Bitmin,if you have enough data to get on discord you have enough data to look up how to pick locks
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Okay
Bitmin,Let me discover a Bobby pins
Bitmin,Pin*
Bitmin,although you may end up convincing your parents that you're basically just slowly backing into the depths of hell and you'll be in even more trouble
Bitmin,just a warning
Bitmin,Yeah if you plug it back in they'll be angry
Bitmin,Risk/reward
Bitmin,My parents think I'm going to hell because I subscribe to evolution as the most practical model of biological origins
Bitmin,So that's a good point
Bitmin,I mean aside from the hell thing you'll still probably get in more trouble
Bitmin,They half jokingly talk about it like that. Not sure if they mean it
Bitmin,Feelsvadman
Bitmin,Pc thrown in trashcan 
Bitmin,Lol
Bitmin,I would kms
Bitmin,And sabotage my dad
Bitmin,oh yeah that was just fantastic when it happened
Bitmin,I just used it as a metaphor/emphasis thingy/whatever you would call it dammit it's been too long since I took english as a class
Bitmin,Wait
Bitmin,Jed will tweezers work?
Bitmin,I can't find Bobby pins
Bitmin,Probably not
Bitmin,if you're talking about a regular locked door a screw driver works
Bitmin,That too
Bitmin,at least my type of doors
Bitmin,A tiny one?
Bitmin,I have a tiny one
Bitmin,try it
Bitmin,Does it need to be flathead?
Bitmin,idk
Bitmin,@Jed joinup

Bitmin,Just general theme n stuff
Bitmin,"it looks nice but one small thing, why is youtube green?"
Bitmin,All the bright colors make me feel like its and ad
Bitmin,maybe that's just me
Bitmin,they're not that bright
Bitmin,You got a reason why blue green yellow purple are your main colors
Bitmin,im gonna try and figure out how to change the stuff to red black and white
Bitmin,Thats our colors
Bitmin,I agree that youtube should be red for recognizeability
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,Cant figure out how to do it with the assets Im using
Bitmin,said bois
Bitmin,Oh in that case it's fine then
Bitmin,also a newt film logo or something instead of the cavern maybe?
Bitmin,thats why I asked if anyone is good with wordpress
Bitmin,or something film related at least
Bitmin,ALso thank you for feedback
Bitmin,okay our logo actually looks like ass
Bitmin,No if those are you colors then it makes more sense to stick to those instead
Bitmin,whats wrong with your logo?
Bitmin,I thought it was fine other than the art maybe having a few minor mistakes
Bitmin,
Bitmin,that just looks so ugly to me
Bitmin,Bleh

Bitmin,
Bitmin,This one looks good
Bitmin,On business cards
Bitmin,Just elegant
Bitmin,Simple
Bitmin,Not so IN YOUR FACE BYATCH
Bitmin,Eh
Bitmin,"I think if you put the newt on tip of films, starting from the right edge of the F and then extending to the end of the S, it'll look fine"
Bitmin,lol that logo took our guy like 6 months because hes a lazy piece of shit. I hardly want to ask him to do another thing. Gotta find another guy tbh
Bitmin,does anyone have the old frostbite logos. Also thank you @Rotomotorz
Bitmin,"However also make the height of the word newt taller than the gap between the top of the F and the top of the I, so it doesn't look like Fnewt films lol"

Bitmin,Mob Psycho 100
Bitmin,"Eighth-grader Shigeo ""Mob"" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks. In order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Reigen Arataka, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Bitmin,oh shit that's out?
Bitmin,goddammit I'm still stuck with my terrible internet
Bitmin,When do you think you'll be back?
Bitmin,shrugs
Bitmin,he's not getting better as fast as he was supposed to (largely because he's super stubborn and not doing all the stuff he's supposed to to help him get better) so I can't even really follow the doctor's estimate cause that was supposed to be sunday
Bitmin,is he fun tho?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,However I'm still in the SDing when going offstage due to not knowing when I can jump out of my arials phase.
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,His recovery is definitely the best in the game if you are high and definitely the worst if you are low
Bitmin,well actually wrastor is probably better high
Bitmin,All around air is just as good as I thought it would be
Bitmin,he seems pretty nuts from what little I've seen
Bitmin,and I feel like he's gonna be one of the those characters with a steep learning curve
Bitmin,aka I'll probably suck at him
Bitmin,From what I can tell his weakness is having 0 kill setups
Bitmin,still gonna give him a shot once I'm back home
Bitmin,I think I'm going to try and get good at him
Bitmin,wait that seems kind of crippling
Bitmin,or does he just have enough stuff that can kill that it doesn't really matter?
Bitmin,His smash attack hitboxes are REALLY BIG
Bitmin,like BIG
Bitmin,its insane
Bitmin,like etalus big?
Bitmin,bigger
Bitmin,the fuck
Bitmin,etalus fsmash actually covers 1/4 - 1/3 of the stage (depending on the stage)
Bitmin,That is because he moves
Bitmin,not because the hitbox is big
Bitmin,it covers less space than etalus fsmash but the hitboxes on upsmash and downsmash are huge
Bitmin,so basically big band? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/276801025258684416/288837755247525889/bb-cmk.png
Bitmin,but with a small hurtbox
Bitmin,not that big
Bitmin,at some point we eventually need to play more SG
Bitmin,(I say while trying to learn blazblue)
Bitmin,Ori will be good at edgeguarding etalus
Bitmin,he has a move that is almost exactly like wrastors down smash
Bitmin,return of the downsmash vs tech wars of early 2017
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak I think Ori is going to be one of my favorite characters
Bitmin,@Jed ROA?
Bitmin,in a bit]
Bitmin,@ me when ready
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,@Max what are the best melee ai?
Bitmin,Link and captain falcon in vanilla
Bitmin,umm
Bitmin,But probably fox on the latest 20xx since he has actual tech skill
Bitmin,that's not what max said he said gannon was best
Bitmin,i don't remember the other one though
Bitmin,Max has done several ai tournaments and pretty sure link has won them all almost
Bitmin,Luigi
Bitmin,Wait.falcon may have been bad
Bitmin,Yeah Luigi and link I think
Bitmin,Me
Bitmin,Yeah kameron too
Bitmin,@here pubg?

Bitmin,thats false
Bitmin,welcome to oregon
Bitmin,in the winter
Bitmin,there was a break yesterday for a few hours
Bitmin,and its only been three days
Bitmin,too bad its rain and not snow xd @ oregon
Bitmin,we actually had snow last year
Bitmin,but also rain
Bitmin,mostly just rain
Bitmin,I've seen it snow enough in a single night that it practically shut down the city for about a week
Bitmin,yay canada
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,same
Bitmin,"except it was like 4"""
Bitmin,still basically shut down the city 
Bitmin,Yeah seriously
Bitmin,Oregon drivers are pussies
Bitmin,yeah thats pathetic
Bitmin,Gets single snow flake
Bitmin,to be fair
Bitmin,west salem is hills
Bitmin,"""SHUTDOWN WHOLE DAMN ROAD"""
Bitmin,and it was ice under snow
Bitmin,Ava Texans are no better with snow xD
Bitmin,also we have like what 1 snow plow?
Bitmin,"well there is no snow to speak of, ever"
Bitmin,"it was some weird freak of temperature and stuff where it snowed a ton, rained a bit, then the rain froze, the whole city was under like a foot of ice, massive power outages across the city, technically drivable but horrifyingly unsafe roads (which we used anyway to make it somewhere with power)"
Bitmin,at least in southern texas
Bitmin,one of my friends who lives three blocks from me had no power for three weeks
Bitmin,aaaAAAA
Bitmin,no power makes me wanna die
Bitmin,"no internet, no a conditioner/heater, to way to make food"
Bitmin,try no power and temperature below freezing
Bitmin,how did you live
Bitmin,we ran away to somewhere with power
Bitmin,"if you couldn't do that, layers and layers of clothing and blankets, use of fireplaces, sharing body heat, etc."
Bitmin,sounds terrible
Bitmin,sometimes im salty I never get snow but then I hear about how bad snowy places have it
Bitmin,"""sharing body heat"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Bitmin,"that's by far the worst I've seen, usually it isn't so bad"
Bitmin,but honestly snow's not all it's cracked up to be
Bitmin,it's nice for the first month or so
Bitmin,then it's kinda annoying
Bitmin,my childhood dreams are crushed
Bitmin,and come february/march you just want nothing to do it anymore
Bitmin,
Bitmin,yeah its novelty wears off fast
Bitmin,"skiing and skating and sledding and snowball fights are still fun, but you kinda stop doing any of that after the first bit"
Bitmin,I love ice skating but the nearest rink is like an hour away
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,nowhere I've stayed in canada has had a rink more than like a fifteen minute walk away
Bitmin,time to move
Bitmin,15 minute WALK?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,How many ice rinks must there be to have one so close to everyone
Bitmin,shrugs welcome to canada
Bitmin,also generally I've only stayed in family-focused residential areas so those tend to have rinks nearby
Bitmin,"To be sure of hitting the target, shoot first and call whatever you hit the target."
Bitmin,some quote ^
Bitmin,That sounds so awesome
Bitmin,I'm really into skating sports
Bitmin,I'm kinda good for a novice

Bitmin,that means max wouldnt go either
Bitmin,nah max is an adult
Bitmin,he's 17
Bitmin,and living at home
Bitmin,but will be 18 by the time we go anywhere
Bitmin,yeah but I'm sure our parents will still stop him
Bitmin,I'm just sad we don't have enough west coasters to justify going somewhere where there's in&out
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,I mean if you guys want to come out I wouldn't be opposed
Bitmin,eh transport'll be way more
Bitmin,and this way I don't have an excuse
Bitmin,they have them in texas
Bitmin,thats the furthest east I think
Bitmin,This is getting insane
Bitmin,I saw someone riding a jet ski on a road I sometimes drive on...
Bitmin,oh god that's amazing
Bitmin,Not if you live here and may have to evacuate.
Bitmin,We might be running out of roads to leave on.
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,So are you gonna leave soon
Bitmin,are things still good where you are?
Bitmin,We just learned that leaving is impossible at this point. So it looks like we are going to have to camp on our second story if things get bad.
Bitmin,For the moment though things are still okay.
Bitmin,but you mostly live up there anyway so...
Bitmin,True but we will have to cut the power to the house.
Bitmin,Well shoot
Bitmin,Stay safe man
Bitmin,that sucks
Bitmin,yeah stay safe and keep us posted
Bitmin,I'll update you guys if things get worse
Bitmin,Thanks for the support
Bitmin,np
Bitmin,Yo if you have to cut power you won't have discord right?
Bitmin,don't die
Bitmin,I have a phone now
Bitmin,do you have data tho?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,That's my number
Bitmin,(oh right it's the states data's way cheaper)
Bitmin,"@Max  question, if you do have to camp on the second floor, would it be possible just to cut power to the first floor?"
Bitmin,I'm not sure
Bitmin,woah what an idea
Bitmin,that could save my sanity
Bitmin,i ask cause one of my friends is in the same situation you might be in and they only cut breakers to the first floor
Bitmin,Ava it's literally flooding and you worry about wifi
Bitmin,it isnt about wifi

Bitmin,"INT. STUDIO-DAY
Donald J Trump sits straight up in his interview chair. In his pitifully tiny hands, he hold a smartphone. He is using the front facing camera to check himself out, and preen himself up as he prepares to be on camera
TRUMP (TO SELF)
You're a winner Donald, a winner I tell yah
Donald winks to himself and clicks off the phone, and puts it into his pocket
DIRECTOR
President Trump, are we ready to roll yet sir?
TRUMP

You bet it James! 
Trump says as he winks
TRUMP
Are the incredible men and women on this set ready to capture my fantastic appearance today? 
JAMES
Yes President Trump. We have been preparing for this shoot for a few weeks. Were all very eager to get this over with.
TRUMP
Fantastic!
James walks out of frame and trump sits up extra straight in his seat. 
JAMES
Alright Everybody!
A grip walks across frame carrying a boom mic, people are scrambling into posistion
JAMES
LIGHTS
Bright lights turn on to illuminate trumps and his interview area
2."
Bitmin,"JAMES
CAMERA
Camera heads swivel into posistion
JAMES
Action!
A slate man appears in front of the main camera and clicks the slate board.
James nods to trump
TRUMP
I will never forget, the day I won the election in 2016. It was amazing, truly fantastic. Really shows that america is a nation of faith, a nation of faith in me. Donald J trump. 
Trump looks down and takes a deep breath through the mouth
TRUMP
Sadly folks, crooked Hillary is trying to bring me down this election cycle. Shes trying to say I worked with Putin, really great guy by the way, to win last years election. That's why I need your help. I need you, and the rest of America to come together, and make this election great. So that I can win, and keep crooked politicians like Hillary and Berney out of office! They would make a huge...
Trump suddenly gets distracted and pulls his phone out of his pocket.
TRUMP
Hehe, Megan Kelly responded to my apology tweet
TRUMP
In Megan Kelly Voice Impersonation Mr Trump I find your lewd comments, rude and offensive
Rolls eyes at camera
TRUMP
I demand you make a more formal and respectful apology, I am uphalled!
3."
Bitmin,"JAMES
whispering Donald, we need to get this back on track!
TRUMP
Oh, right
Trump puts the phone back into his pocket
TRUMP
And that is why I need your help to keep berney and Hillary out of office by voting me in instead. I promise, if you vote for me, I will literally buy all of your children I phone 8's. I have HUGE amounts of money because of how successful and fortunate I am! I swear if I wasn't for TRUMP brand I couldn't count a dime to my name, but I swear to God, you put my name and some god damned gold on a building, and you will be rich out of your mind
James can be seen making huge x motions with his hands
TRUMP
James why are you doing that with your hands
James walks into frame, and on set. 
JAMES
Donald, we talked about this extensively before hand. This is network television, you cant swear and say whatever the hell you want! I need you to tone it back, or were going to have to cancel this broadcast.
TRUMP
...
TRUMP
You know what James. I'm going to make you an offer.
James sighs and shakes his head in regret
JAMES
Whispers to self Oh lord what this time...

Bitmin,"TRUMP
 James, M gonna make you an offer, here it is. I will buy your entire studio and network, and you let me run this cast how I see fit. I have a HUGE message I am trying to get to the american people James. 
JAMES

JAMES
You know what Donald, you do whatever the hell you want. You have infinite money, if you fuck up this broadcast, and get me in trouble with the network, I will let you handle it.
TRUMP
Ah boring James over here. Always such a prude with keeping it clean on tv. Can we get back to work here?"
Bitmin,My software wont let me send it so ill just POST THE WHOLE THING

Bitmin,I cant believe im comstock
Bitmin,Just finished
Bitmin,BruH
Bitmin,what an ending
Bitmin,yaw it's a crazy ending
Bitmin,Fantastic game
Bitmin,great game in general
Bitmin,Brilliant example of how to make a great single player experience
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,literally my main complaint is that that one semi-automatic rifle was kind of op but not super exciting to use
Bitmin,The carbine?
Bitmin,I think so
Bitmin,Yeah that thing was busted
Bitmin,yeah its was
Bitmin,I only use the pistol in machine gun for the first half of the game
Bitmin,Then shit got way too hard so I started using real guns
Bitmin,yeah the difficulty ramps way up in the last third or so
Bitmin,Now my go play Bioshock and BioShock 2 right
Bitmin,I should probably play those too
Bitmin,I bought the package all three remastered for 20 bucks
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,also imo the most fun gun combo is hand cannon + that rebel shotgun that lights people on fire
Bitmin,That thing didn't have any ammo though
Bitmin,yeah they're both pretty low on ammo
Bitmin,I wish I'd had more money on my plate through cause then I could have got more cool upgrades
Bitmin,I didn't say it was practical
Bitmin,I think we can all agree the repeater was booty though
Bitmin,which one's that?
Bitmin,It was like the machine gun but with the less ammo in the slower rate of fire. It was a vox gun
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,and takes fire up to be accurate
Bitmin,dude the insane asylum part was spooky
Bitmin,when ben franklins head rolled out i paused and walked away
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,Oh
Bitmin,I didn't get spooped
Bitmin,But it was very atmospheric
Bitmin,I expected a big attack after it
Bitmin,Jed
Bitmin,Gaymez?
Bitmin,what
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,oh god the asylum
Bitmin,fuuuuck that was some creepy shit
Bitmin,yes

The demo is available to download through battle.net. It doesn't matter if you are new to the game because if we manage to get a big enough game the large number of players will balance out the more skilled players as they can be teamed against.

Bitmin,I feel sorry for you
Bitmin,also haha I have another week before classes
Bitmin,I start tomorrow as well
Bitmin,I actually start wednesday
Bitmin,I have another week
Bitmin,but won't be up late tomorrow
Bitmin,and my first day of class I don't start till 130 and I only have one class
Bitmin,tuesday is hell tho
Bitmin,"830-930, 1000-1130, 100-230, 230-330, 630-8"
Bitmin,Ouch
Bitmin,yikes
Bitmin,6.5 hours of class spread haphazardly across 12 hours of time
Bitmin,HaA
Bitmin,Sucks for you mAtE
Bitmin,also what kind of whack scheduling led to this being a thing https://gyazo.com/66af9112c8a2d59d60c1de02a293ddcc
Bitmin,Gyazo
Bitmin,Jed come do college with me dork
Bitmin,nah
Bitmin,You're dumb
Bitmin,Die
Bitmin,Gayms when I get home Bois hype
Bitmin,"two 1.5-hour segments of the same class, an hour and a half apart, in different lecture halls"
Bitmin,"on the flip side, for winter term (january-april) I have 7 fewer hours of class per week"
Bitmin,and no classes friday
Bitmin,seriously winter term is a joke for me https://gyazo.com/f2346dd6cd66473f5a2477a1cbe7f2a1
Bitmin,Gyazo
Bitmin,"12 hours a week, no friday classes, one online course"
Bitmin,Why would you get your classes so far apart?
Bitmin,Mine are 10 minutes apart
Bitmin,although for one of those I'll have to cross the campus in those 10 minutes oops
Bitmin,"cause these are all the only timeslots for these classes, or I used these specific ones in order to not have friday classes"
Bitmin,"also I like having spaced out classes, gives you time to relax and do nice things like eat or chill at the library in between"
Bitmin,I'd much rather have three hours of class with 3 hour gaps than three hours of straight classes with ten minute breaks and the rest of the day off
Bitmin,and honestly I'd put up with a lot for perpetual 3-day weekends
Bitmin,"which will probably translate to me doing a lot more out of town smash tournaments, especially if I can find people to carpool with -_-"
Bitmin,@Max how was your first day of college?
Bitmin,It was fine
Bitmin,Had to park super far away from my class
Bitmin,How were the classes tho
Bitmin,First day was just learning about the course
Bitmin,no real work
Bitmin,"oh yeah you've never had syllabus days before, have you?"
Bitmin,expect that for the whole first week
Bitmin,That's how it usually is
Bitmin,Whole first week?
Bitmin,"One of the first things my EDUC prof said to us is ""I like to cuss a lot so if that offends you please switch classes""."
Bitmin,yeah profs are also an interesting mixed bag
Bitmin,EDUC?
Bitmin,It is a required course where you learn about college and how to succeed in life
Bitmin,"also yeah for uni it's usually the first week, cause you've got your courses spread out by day (you start doing stuff in some courses but it's mostly review of previous material)"
Bitmin,seems like an easy A
Bitmin,that sounds either really useful or incredibly boring
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane you have scrims?
Bitmin,ye boi
Bitmin,dang
Bitmin,@Jed @Max you guys wanna queue a couple of overwatch games?

Bitmin,pretty proud of that
Bitmin,I already have homework
Bitmin,gg
Bitmin,So do I
Bitmin,I mean to be fair its in my only AP class

Bitmin,also by fire drills I mean drunk assholes pulling the fire alarm
Bitmin,What's the point of that?
Bitmin,Ah
Bitmin,I see
Bitmin,"we were famous as ""the residence where we pulled the fire alarm a few years ago and the firefighters came to us instead of an actual fire cause we're higher priority cause tons of people live there and some people died"""

Bitmin,I could actually do well in it
Bitmin,like top 3

Bitmin,I already had an 830
Bitmin,and I have classes today until 8pm

Bitmin,My mondays suck
Bitmin,But your tuesday seems worse than my monday
Bitmin,All my days are the same
Bitmin,I have class from 8:30-6:50
Bitmin,I've only got 6.5 hours total but they're spread out and I'm basically stuck on campus all day
Bitmin,That's the same with me
Bitmin,all my classes are like an hour apart
Bitmin,"I've got some half hour breaks, some hour and a half, some two hours, but never at convienient times to go back home until the end of the day"
Bitmin,You need that briefcase setup
Bitmin,"He just put up a slide that just says ""How not to fail STAT263 and any non-fakeable course"""
Bitmin,shots fired
Bitmin,"he just showed us his first year transcript, his highest mark is a 67 and he failed some"
Bitmin,what a baller
Bitmin,"and now he's literally going ""english.  I could fake that.  Calculus, not so much"""
Bitmin,his average was a 48
Bitmin,How did this mans become a professor?
Bitmin,he's telling the story of how he turned his life around
Bitmin,"and he actually just said ""I'm probably the only person teaching right now who had a year like this"""
Bitmin,"he says he's willing to print out a certificate that says ""For what it's worth, this is to certify that [YOUR NAME HERE] is, in fact, smarter than Professor Charles Arthur Molson"""
Bitmin,man gives no fucks
Bitmin,"""What I hope to hear said about me is 'Damn, that dumb son of a bitch can really teach'"""
Bitmin,and he's now pulling bad reviews from his own ratemyteacher page
Bitmin,"""if you're sleeping in my class, that's fine"""
Bitmin,now he's using a picture of grafitti from a queen's bathroom stall to demonstrate statistics
Bitmin,what a god
Bitmin,he's planning to use the distribution of cell phones ringing during his lectures as something we're going to study
Bitmin,"""When the grim reaper comes for you, you will never get these stat263 hours back"""
Bitmin,"""Ha! And you were wondering what scary thing to dress up as for halloween? LURKING VARIABLES"""

Bitmin,thats fine

Bitmin,sounds good
Bitmin,What is your main race?

Bitmin,white
Bitmin,dabbled in zerg but I don't really remember most of it
Bitmin,I usually play Terran but I've considered swapping to Protoss
Bitmin,i too dabbed on zerg
Bitmin,my brother played terran and I vaguely remember swarms of marines and medevacs that were a bitch to deal with as protoss if I didn't have templars
Bitmin,that can happen
Bitmin,medivacs I think
Bitmin,"shrugs I wouldn't really know, I was just mashing medicine and evacuate together"
Bitmin,Evil Emperor Zurg?
Bitmin,Woah
Bitmin,also if I remember correctly the reason I ended up mostly not playing zerg was cause my brother and dad both played a lot of protoss and used mostly flying stuff that I couldn't seem to beat cause the only big zerg units could only hit ground -_-
Bitmin,I'm sure there's a way around that but I have no idea what
Bitmin,Hydralisks
Bitmin,Corruptors
Bitmin,Vipers
Bitmin,"everying zerg is a -lisk, you'll have to remind me what all these things ar"
Bitmin,are hydralisks the flapping things that shoot bouncing shots?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,those are mutalisks
Bitmin,those suck at anti air
Bitmin,they are flying anti worker mainly
Bitmin,shrugs for now I'll stick to protoss
Bitmin,you should because if you do we will have all 3 races in our ffa
Bitmin,noice
Bitmin,diversity
Bitmin,Diversity is our strenght. Socialism our goal. Equality our ideal. WE ARE LIBERALS!

Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Is it possible to use a calculator to solve matrix's?
Bitmin,You would probably need a sophisticated calculator to do so
Bitmin,if you've got a graphing calculator
Bitmin,there's definately some online stuff that'll do it for you tho
Bitmin,My friends calculators have them
Bitmin,well rip I don't
Bitmin,"also, matrices is the plural of matrix"
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,whatever
Bitmin,I've been at this for like 4-5 hours

Bitmin,What platform is that game on?
Bitmin,ps3 and ps4

I don’t know any veterans who are college aged, but if I did I would definitely tell them about the veteran’s benefits they can receive. Getting a good job is probably the most common goal for college students. Everyone with this goal should pay a visit to the CASA building to see career counselors and advisors. The CASE building is definitely a fun place to hang out and play video games!"

Bitmin,"""I would rather have a goat than a Ferrari"" - Professor David Molson"
Bitmin,Ferrari's require maintenance while you can make a profit from selling goat milk.
Bitmin,"naw they're just super loud, and apparently goats are really friendly and stuff"
Bitmin,he had partial ownership of a goat while he was in the military and he loved it
Bitmin,it was his platoon's goat
Bitmin,Why does a platoon need a goat?
Bitmin,no idea
Bitmin,"but I vaguely remember it's a thing, at least it used to be"
Bitmin,according to google a few canadian regiments have had goat mascots
Bitmin,I mean take the ferrari and sell it to buy lots of goats?

Bitmin,this is part of a proof we covered in my algorithms class today https://scontent.fybz1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21994323_10213840279302832_1370287803129051811_o.jpg?oh=9f0bbbe4eabb7d161100e1cf8a793f31&oe=5A4C09DE
Bitmin,what a mess
Bitmin,was not a fun proof
Bitmin,I despise any subject which requires proofs
Bitmin,I actually really like proofs
Bitmin,but this one was terrifying
Bitmin,"I much prefer traditional equations, inequalities, and graphs."
Bitmin,proof are pretty much just applications of all of those things
Bitmin,but yeah I can see why you don't like em
Bitmin,I hated proofs initially
Bitmin,but I'm always a sucker for puzzle styled stuff so once I started getting the hang of them I had a good time
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,yeah?
Bitmin,sc?
Bitmin,sure just a sec
Bitmin,Proofs are basically Satan's butthole

Bitmin,I might play
Bitmin,In like a while
Bitmin,RIP my awesome winter term schedule
Bitmin,"dropped one of my courses for this term, replaced it with a different one next term (that everyone says is easier and the prof's not an ass, and where I can take either for my degree), and now I've lost my super easy schedule and no friday classes"
Bitmin,Rip
Bitmin,"on the flip side, at least this term should be manageable"
Bitmin,cause that one course was occupying like half my time and I was doing terribly
Bitmin,and I'd already gotten in a mini-fight with the prof
Bitmin,Yeah that's no good
Bitmin,What class is this?
Bitmin,"digital systems, it's basically agressive circuitry and the nuts and bolts of how computers are put together"
Bitmin,which should be super interesting
Bitmin,I agree
Bitmin,"but the prof subscribes to this ""innovative"" teaching model which is really good in theory - the dry lecture learning stuff is done outside of class, then class time is for application of what you've learned and you can ask questions and stuff really easily"
Bitmin,the problem is that he kinda forgot about the whole applying stuff in class part
Bitmin,"so it's pretty hard to make sense of anything cause a) first class after readings is a test on the readings without an opportunity to ask about anything you're confused about, then in between that and the other class of the week there's an ""in-class assignment"" which isn't done in class, and he doesn't reply to email questions about it so you still don't really know what you're doing for it, then the second class he takes up the test and stumbles around trying to answer questions about the actual content we're confused about"
Bitmin,"on top of which, there's labs every couple of weeks, which are even more complicated, and by terrible scheduling, I have other lectures during almost all the open lab sections where you can show up and work with the TAs to get stuff done (the only one that I can show up to I can only show up to half an hour of it, which isn't enough), and the software we have to work on is super buggy on my computer and periodically just freezes and deletes whatever project I was working on if I kill it with task manager"
Bitmin,"and when I asked him for an evening-long extention in light of this (was due at 4pm, but there was an open lab for it from 5-7 that night which I could go to), not only did he not give an extention, he also just gives instant zero to a late submission"
Bitmin,and that was going to happen pretty much every lab
Bitmin,so we got into a bit of an argument about that
Bitmin,this is also the course where everyone is slowly bailing
Bitmin,"I started out in a 5-person group, two people dropped, he mashed the remaining three together with two other groups so we then had an 8-person group, which has now dwindled to a 5-person group (4 now that I've dropped)"
Bitmin,"td;dr - cool sounding course, prof butchered any reasonable chance of understanding it and is also stupidly rigid in how he handles things, about half the class has dropped and I'm incredibly happy to be part of that half"
Bitmin,Sounds like hell
Bitmin,Meanwhile I am sitting here trying to be productive during my unexpected 1 hour break by writing out code on my phone
Bitmin,
Bitmin,you really need a laptop
Bitmin,Check it out
Bitmin,I really do
Bitmin,This is kind of painful
Bitmin,I can imagine
Bitmin,but seriously how are you doing the whole uni thing without a laptop?
Bitmin,are you taking notes by hand?
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,It's not too bad
Bitmin,It just sucks when I have these breaks
Bitmin,"get a cheap laptop, do work during breaks"
Bitmin,I spend most of my breaks off the corner of one of the libraries doing assignments or studying
Bitmin,it's honestly really good for productivity
Bitmin,you can probably get a laptop that does what you need for a couple hundred bucks at most
Bitmin,somewhat related but Android studio makes me want to rip my toenails out
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak I approve the switch back to your old (and obviously superior) profile picture
Bitmin,eh I like them both but this one shows better in the discord bubble
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether games?
Bitmin,I'm in
Bitmin,Girls can now join the boy scouts
Bitmin,...
Bitmin,Yup
Bitmin,I happen to remember something called the girl scouts existing so this seems pointless
Bitmin,Girl scouts leadership ran it into the ground
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether games?
Bitmin,in a few minutes
Bitmin,"well rip me, 2-0'd one of my melee demons only to immediately lose my next two matches and not even make top 8"
Bitmin,"on the flip side, my record against sasquatch is now 3-15"
Bitmin,a marked improvement
Bitmin,also I had a weird run through like all the people I usually fight
Bitmin,"please let me fight someone other than sasquatch, dayman, and milk"
Bitmin,I almost always fight two or more of them per tournament
Bitmin,3/4 tournaments I've fought dayman and at least one of milk or sasquatch
Bitmin,holy shit one of the compsci academic advisers here is named Erin Gunsinger and that might be the most badass name I've ever heard
Bitmin,oh snap
Bitmin,thats lit
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Bitmin,COLLEGE APP DUE TOMORROW YOU FOOL
Bitmin,don't worry about it i believe in doing everything at the literal last second
Bitmin,SCREW YOU
Bitmin,@games here?
Bitmin,@here
Bitmin,im down later
Bitmin,@Jed gamezzz?
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Bitmin,did you deafen me fusion?
Bitmin,I got through the entire starcraft brood war soundtrack (47:50) 3 and a half times while doing homework. Why must it be so long.
Bitmin,are Koth maps bo3 now ? in comp ?
Bitmin,indeed my dude
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak

Bitmin,my dude
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,SLEEP
Bitmin,SOON
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,LEAVE ME ALONE
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak sleep is for the week
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak would you rather sleep or watch anime i already know its watch anime to comoooon
Bitmin,grumble
Bitmin,what would we watc
Bitmin,"black clover, my hero academia, monster"
Bitmin,I've already watched like all of mha
Bitmin,at least all that's dubbed
Bitmin,"ew Sylki, you refuse to watch subbed even if thats all there is ? ? ?"
Bitmin,no that's not what I said
Bitmin,I've watched a lot of things that have only sub
Bitmin,sounds like it
Bitmin,and a lot of subs for stuff where I didn't like the dub
Bitmin,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Bitmin, An error occurred: Error: socket hang up
Bitmin,"also ava just to clarify that discussion cause I wasn't paying a ton of attention (and was also like half asleep), MHA has simultaneous sub and dub, the dub is really good but delayed by about a week, which I'm willing to wait"
Bitmin,o h  I see
Bitmin,Is being straight kinda gay
Bitmin,i mean think about it
Bitmin,you're into someone who sucks dick
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak rivals in 30?
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,eh sure
Bitmin,we could do a 4 man tourney if @Max is down
Bitmin,yee
Bitmin,@Max you down my dude?
Bitmin,octagon why
Bitmin,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitmin,I can't tell if you just did that as a counterpoint to my name or if you're carefully avoiding Zack Attack
Bitmin,Doing school reading. We'll see if i can play or not.
Bitmin,the world may never know
Bitmin,people only play ori now and its annoying as hell
Bitmin,ori's kinda broke
Bitmin,and easier rushdown than wrastor
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Bitmin,"kk, gonna make a bathroom run first"
Bitmin,Can't sorry busy with school work
Bitmin,just play anyways
Bitmin,read while playing=profit
Bitmin,do school later
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,ez
Bitmin,
Bitmin,also if we do a tourney you can play during offtime
Bitmin,@Max doki doki literature club?????
Bitmin,what?
Bitmin,it says you're playing it
Bitmin,It's more important than his schoolwork
Bitmin,I just finished my school work
Bitmin,then join us my dude
Bitmin,eh
Bitmin,mini tourney
Bitmin,I only have like 25-30 minutes of free time before I need to start on more school
Bitmin,that's enough time
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,Ava's comments on this game make me want to continue
Bitmin,we wanna see where everyone stands in skill rn
Bitmin,and octagon's like good at this game now
Bitmin,keeping it close with me in kragg dittos
Bitmin,I know I've played him a lot
Bitmin,come on you can play it whenever
Bitmin,Also I'll lose because you are all warm and my first 5 or so games I suck
Bitmin,wrastor is hard man
Bitmin,we'll open with round robin
Bitmin,"and then top two play for 1st, bottom two play for 3rd"
Bitmin,Another time
Bitmin,bruh
Bitmin,I don't feel up to it right now
Bitmin,and I know it will take longer than I have
Bitmin,30 MINUTES HUH
Bitmin,dear friendo
Bitmin,if you don't want to play with us
Bitmin,just say so
Bitmin,don't make them excuses

Bitmin,"@Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane I started my assignment at 11:00 which is almost exactly 30 minutes after I sent my message. I do not lie and I did indeed have a school assignment to do. After I finished it, you guys were playing csgo which I had no interest in therefore I didn't feel the need to say anything about finishing. I don't make things up or lie. If I simply didn't want to play I would have said so, like I do whenever Overwatch is suggested. In those cases I'm sure you can remember many ""no I don't want to""'s. If you want I can even screenshot my ceritficate of completion of the assignment that I am emailed if you do not believe me."
Bitmin, best emote
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"K fair @Max, you can understand our assumption tho"
Bitmin,"Yeah I understand, I just wanted to clarify my innocence."
Bitmin,Idk still seems shday to me
Bitmin,"on an unrelated note, who's down to do a 5-queue with our names as Zack Attack, Zack Defense, Zack Sp. Attack, Zack Sp. Defense, and Zack Speed? @Cs:go"
Bitmin,"not now, but like, tonight some time"
Bitmin,I call Zack Speed
Bitmin,Yee
Bitmin,also I have more work tonight so maybe not
Bitmin,we'll see
Bitmin,I'm doing math now but I have a paper later
Bitmin,we'll see I guess
Bitmin,try to get as much done as you can
Bitmin,btw I'm going to be carving my profile picture into a pumpkin for halloween
Bitmin,the terran crest?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,that's pretty sweet
Bitmin,Its probably my favorite faction logo of all time
Bitmin,"all the sc ones are pretty sick, personally I prefer the protoss one"
Bitmin,go figure
Bitmin,its also cool
Bitmin,"I'm also pretty partial to the persona 5 player faction/crew logo, though it's not the kind of thing you can engrave on a pumpkin, at least not easily"
Bitmin,thats in interesting one
Bitmin,it's also kinda weird cause you don't actually get a character who wears a hat until pretty late in the game
Bitmin,and it's not even really a top hat
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak  I just started doki doki and i'm so on edge because the only thing i've heard about it is what you put in the memes channel
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,I haven't gotten far enough for anything to actually happen either
Bitmin,but I'm terrified of everything
Bitmin,Its quite an experience
Bitmin,and there's this tiny part of me that thinks it might all just be a huge meme and it's actually a totally normal story and they just got everyone to say it goes hard in the psychological horror
Bitmin,which would be really funny
Bitmin,but I'm hoping that doesn't happen
Bitmin,
Bitmin,oh dang I have to write a poem?
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,it doesn't have to make sense
Bitmin,just do what I did and choose your favourite word from each page and see where it ends you up
Bitmin,or be super tactical and choose the ones you think will impress your future waifu(?)
Bitmin,you guys gotta pick words to please a specific girl!!
Bitmin,^ was about to say that
Bitmin,yea
Bitmin,WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBS
Bitmin,"yeah I noticed, but they jump when I pick darker words"
Bitmin,I picked based that way and 16/20 seemed to make the purple hair girl happy so.... shrugs
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I think they jump for the stuff they like
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,
Bitmin,THATS STILL SPOOKY
Bitmin,also I've barely gotten past the poem bit so don't say anything that happens after that
Bitmin,got it
Bitmin,"except maybe who ended up the happiest from your poem, cause curiosity"
Bitmin,spoiler-free catholic discord
Bitmin,yeah I wanna know too :0
Bitmin,whoever you choose the most words for you spend the day with at the club before reading poems
Bitmin,well obviously i'm going for yuri because she's best girl
Bitmin,nO
Bitmin,ew
Bitmin,Natsuki > Sayori > Yuri
Bitmin,wow
Bitmin,i guess it's ok to be wrong
Bitmin,Sayori > Natsuki > Yuri
Bitmin,Natsuki is a weeb and a tsundere ! ! Tsunderes are funny characters
Bitmin,natsuki is trash
Bitmin,Yuri is trash
Bitmin,no u
Bitmin,chill
Bitmin,in the small portion I've played I'm gonna have to agree with smithy here
Bitmin,oh boy
Bitmin,aaAAAAA
Bitmin,not necessarily on the best girl part cause I'm not far enough to have an opinion on that yet
Bitmin,but on the fact that natsuki seems annoying
Bitmin,shes funny imo
Bitmin,shrug
Bitmin,I don;t like tsunderes
Bitmin,"the general archetype works fine, it's just when it's played totally straight that it's annoying"
Bitmin,"you can either use it as a small part of the character (see: kurisu in steins gate), or blow it wildly out of proportion for comedic purposes (see: nichijou)"
Bitmin,"wait, who's the tsundere in nichijou?"
Bitmin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQq5d6v59xg

Bitmin,oh right I totally forgot about her lol
Bitmin,literally the most tsundere character I've ever seen
Bitmin,welp
Bitmin,"in an epic lack of proper group communication (my fault as well), two separate group members each did about half of the project"
Bitmin,now we're gonna have to compare and see whose stuff to keep
Bitmin,You mean you split into 2 teams and each did the same half?
Bitmin,naw we just figured we'd get started on it before discussing it with the group (I didn't bother telling them cause they didn't start early last time and I just dropped a 2/3 finished project on them and said do the rest and that worked out just fine)
Bitmin,but we both decided to start and not tell anyone
Bitmin,oh okay
Bitmin,Mine would have been funnier
Bitmin,and cause it's programming it's entirely possible that even if we did exactly opposite halves we won't be able to just mush them together
Bitmin,well it does look like we did nearly opposite halves
Bitmin,so at least it'll be easier than if we'd both done totally different parts
Bitmin,"@Rivals of Aether My opinions on each characters worst matchup                                                  Wrastor>Maypul
Zetterburn>Wrastor
Absa>Kragg
Etalus>Zetterburn
Orcane>Etalus
Kragg>Orcane
Zetterburn>Absa
No apparent counter>Forsburn"
Bitmin,btw Good in matchup>Character being countered
Bitmin,not sure about the kragg > orcane thing
Bitmin,In my experience it is true because he can power through bubbles
Bitmin,his only way to power through bubbles is sideb
Bitmin,which is really easy to counter
Bitmin,thats enough
Bitmin,you can get through and immediately put yourself in a terrible position
Bitmin,worst matchup does not mean bad
Bitmin,its cause max always beats me in that matchup 
Bitmin,I don't think orcane has any matchups that are very bad at all
Bitmin,altought i agree that kragg counters orcane for the following reasons
Bitmin,all of his moves slightly outrange or outprioritize orcanes options
Bitmin,"I feel like zetter, absa do better against orcane"
Bitmin,orcanes biggest strength is edgegarding and kragg cant be edgeguarded
Bitmin,you can't out-camp absa with bubbles
Bitmin,orcane beats both of them imo
Bitmin,the weight matchup is wierd
Bitmin,rocks>bubbles
Bitmin,and I dunno if zetter's actually good but I randomly pulled my half-decent zetter and beat kameron
Bitmin,if you get hit by kragg as orcane you're pretty much dead
Bitmin,eh only if he's got the right setups in place
Bitmin,like only if I can bully you offstage into rock rock rock rock
Bitmin,Kragg gets huge punishes of almost everything
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,you just have not figured it out yet
Bitmin,yes but I feel like he blows at getting in
Bitmin,his biggest weakness is his approach sucks
Bitmin,i kinda disagree
Bitmin,eh
Bitmin,His approach is fine
Bitmin,my defense on orcane is just good
Bitmin,speaking of rivals anyone wanna play
Bitmin,im down after dinner
Bitmin,I'm down
Bitmin,lol maybe in a little bit
Bitmin,4 man tourney les go bois
Bitmin,maybe we'll get that 4-man tourney going
Bitmin,surprised one challenged my forsburn statement
Bitmin,i have to do it soonish tho
Bitmin,none of us know forsburn
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,i think he gets countered by iceguy
Bitmin,he can combo etalus really well but maybe
Bitmin,"generally speaking though, my general reasoning for why kragg >>> orcane doesn't entirely hold up is just from fighting kameron a ton, going more or less even with my kragg and then doing about the same with my worse characters"
Bitmin,which doesn't quite make sense
Bitmin,you put orcane >>> etalus and my etalus usually does alright
Bitmin,Kameron plays against 3 Kragg players and is just good at the matchup
Bitmin,well i have tons of practice against kragg
Bitmin,fair
Bitmin,also yeah we have all kind of gravitated over to the rock beetle
Bitmin,I'm going to make a more detailed ROA stats/opinions list shortly
Bitmin,also I've gotta say I love octagon's kragg
Bitmin,it's got the same dumb reads I get only more
Bitmin,although as soon as I started reading his reads things went downhill
Bitmin,cause he goes for the same reads a lot
Bitmin,ill be there at 7 and then we can do a 4 man tourney
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak GET IN HERE BOIIII
Bitmin,finishing a bagel then I'm in
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak how long does it take to eat a bagel?
Bitmin,long time
Bitmin,is actually several bagels
Bitmin,with a bunch of stuff on them
Bitmin,"I just got my first ""ending"" and I don't know how I feel"
Bitmin,"good job, queen's 
http://www.cp24.com/news/330-charges-laid-33-arrested-during-homecoming-at-queen-s-university-1.3634572"
Bitmin,"330 charges laid, 33 arrested during homecoming at Queen's University"
Bitmin,"Police say they laid hundreds of charges during Queen's University homecoming celebrations in Kingston, Ont., over the weekend."
Bitmin,"and I'm assuming one of those would involve one the brother of one of my housemates, who got stabbed in the face"
Bitmin,"(he's fine, more or less, but he'll probably have a scar)"
Bitmin,good old homecoming
Bitmin,props on them for doubling the numbers
Bitmin,on them?
Bitmin,to them?
Bitmin,I think 'to them'
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,unfortunatley I care not enough to fix my bad grammar
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak friendlies?
Bitmin,sure
Bitmin,get in here nerd
Bitmin,"sec, bathrooming first"
Bitmin,"This is very important
Some guy on our team was 1-13 and we're like ""Darius you're shit at this game""
AND THIS MAN GOES ""Oh yeah well i can speak 2 languages"""
Bitmin,"like good for you, you still suck ass at league dont play ranked"
Bitmin,Gottem
Bitmin,Welp today's the day we get new rivals characters and I've got lectures and meetings till 930 and a few tests to study for
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,I actually have my first class off
Bitmin,So I'm testing the new characters right now
Bitmin,Clairen is super fun
Bitmin,Ranno as seems fun
Bitmin,general playstles?
Bitmin,Clairen looks like she will be a all around character. Her neutral and punishes both look good. Ranno looks to be a powerhouse on stage that will be easily gimped.
Bitmin,first impressions
Bitmin,I have a feeling there is going to be at least 1 character (I'm thinking absa at the moment) who is going to do AWEFUL against Clairen.
Bitmin,do either of them have the nice movement à la zetterburn?
Bitmin,"mostly clairen, I enjoy not getting gimped a ton so I feel like I'll probably like her more"
Bitmin,Froggy boi seems op
Bitmin,"all in all, we need more non-kragg mains in this discord so maybe this will help"
Bitmin,Yeah I'ma get the dlc
Bitmin,"we basically have two and a half kraggs, one and a half orcanes, and a wrastor"
Bitmin,I'm kinda an everything
Bitmin,yeah but your kragg's probably your best
Bitmin,"maybe I'll adjust down to just two kraggs - me, kinda you, kinda max"
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether If anyone wants to help me test Ranno and Clairen just @me.
Bitmin,The amount of creative potential present in Clairen's increased hitpause on tipper is huge.
Bitmin,I'm already in the lab making setups.
Bitmin,OH SHIT CLAIREN'S GOT TIPPERS?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,sweet
Bitmin,lemme at them tippers
Bitmin,later -_-
Bitmin,"Yo mans, when are we gonna watch RWBY?"
Bitmin,I'm down pretty much whenever
Bitmin,"it's not out for non-members yet, I don't think"
Bitmin,Let me check
Bitmin,@Max wanna play?

Bitmin,we needed a hype falcon
Bitmin,nah
Bitmin,too many falcons
Bitmin,two?
Bitmin,two is too many?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,I'm pretty sure S2J has never done better than 0-2 at summit
Bitmin,he really shouldnt go
Bitmin,i just wish pewpewu got the w
Bitmin,what about the eight foxes (and m2k's kind of a fox)
Bitmin,that's literally half the summit
Bitmin,because screw you
Bitmin,get logicked
Bitmin,"character breakdown (including dual mains):
Fox - 8
Falco - 1
Marth - 1
Sheik - 3
Puff - 1
Peach - 1
Falcon - 2
Luigi - 1
Yoshi - 1"
Bitmin,the best part is that a fox probably wont win
Bitmin,unless you count armada
Bitmin,which I did
Bitmin,the real dream is amsa winning
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,"the highest paying tourney, ever"
Bitmin,m2k winning is the dream
Bitmin,"just, surprise yoshi wins"
Bitmin,"rough order of what I want to see: Amsa, Plup, Hax, Blea Gelo, S2J, Axe"
Bitmin,pulpW

Bitmin,cause it's so good
Bitmin,but I'm so full
Bitmin,and it's so salty
Bitmin,what is it?
Bitmin,there's like no moisture left in my mouth
Bitmin,I made the most badass sandwich
Bitmin,"i say, toss it in da trash"
Bitmin,and come play with me

Bitmin,World's Best Smash 4 Player Is Worn Down By Haters And Harassment
Bitmin,"For 13 minutes, Gonzalo “Zero” Barrios’ face barely moved. It was the Grand Finals match of a Super Smash Bros. Wii U tournament, and Barrios, the best Smash player in the world, was squaring off against a formidable opponent. A few feet away, Barrios’ bodyguard kept a lookout for a man who’d threatened to be there, in wait, with a gun aimed at the champion gamer."
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane Someone asked me to tutor them how much should I charge?
Bitmin,"I don't know what a reasonable amount is, but make sure you start by asking what they'd be willing to pay first, in case it's way more than what you were gonna ask for"
Bitmin,also depends on what you're doing
Bitmin,i charge people $5 to look at their completed code if it doesnt work and i fix it
Bitmin,one guy literally just forgot to indent something
Bitmin,i hit the tab key once and got $5
Bitmin,but if its something more important and difficult like physics definetly raise ur price
Bitmin,also little haggling tip if they tell you to make an offer always ask more than you want
Bitmin,that way when you lower your price to what you want they feel like they're getting a deal
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether games?
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,What is it?

Bitmin,What did you think of the game?

Bitmin,I have reached an impressive level of simmering anger at this point
Bitmin,nah just do it
Bitmin,play me fool
Bitmin,I GOT 17TH
Bitmin,I DID WORSE THAN SENDO
Bitmin,AND I LOST TO BUCKTOWN
Bitmin,yeah but you can get first in the 1v1 against me in rivals

Bitmin,and there's a monthly tomorrow and my confidence has gone down the drain
Bitmin,"lololol I was on commentary for a bit on the stream, I watched a bit and due to our shitty mic it sounds like I have some super weird accent that's a blend of like scottish and australian"
Bitmin,@Rotomotorz do you want to do 5 tp mission
Bitmin,i already did
Bitmin,@everyone Sylki and I are currently hosting a creative writing project. In this project we are going to be agreeing on a basic story premise and taking turns writing chapters after that. We already have 4 people and are looking for 1 more so please PM me if you're interested. We are looking to make a serious story so if you plan on meming your way through it don't bother signing up.
Bitmin,"Sylki, that's just how you sound normally"
Bitmin,What do you mean?
Bitmin,look up a couple of messages
Bitmin,I was replying to his earlier statement
Bitmin,"also, I did better at the monthly (waaaay more stacked) than the weekly -_-"
Bitmin,wait the pyro has a jetpack now\
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,It's shit
Bitmin,It's really really bad
Bitmin,okay but like
Bitmin,still
Bitmin,I've been playing all of yesterday and today
Bitmin,@Max I met a good wrastor
Bitmin,"welp at the monthly, top 8 was initially 5/8 kingston people, and now we've reached top 3 and it's just the out of town people"
Bitmin,"also top two seeds from my pool both made top eight, backing up my claim that I got the hardest pool"
Bitmin,"except maybe the ryan ford, sandman, sasquatch pool"
Bitmin,that one was pretty viscious
Bitmin,@everyone I need a new headset anyone have any legit suggestions
Bitmin,"I've got a razer kraken, it's pretty good"
Bitmin,thats what i got right now
Bitmin,i was gonna get another one unless i got a better suggestion

Bitmin,im guessing you dont want to play rivals
Bitmin,Hyperx cloud 2's
Bitmin,MAX YOU'RE SCARING ME
Bitmin,why?
Bitmin,I just meant that most people playing DDLC don't want to stop because they want to see what happens
Bitmin,this game's scary enough without slightly suspect phrasing outside it too
Bitmin,@Jed fite me
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,@Max i downloaded starcraft
Bitmin,"Doing something, I'll be there soon"

Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether I beat someone on the ladder who had around 1200 rank points!
Bitmin,Noice
Bitmin,"My group for one of my classes is writing a report, one section is on ""issues and lessons learned"", and one thing that happened was we asked our assigned TA - a guy named Hang - for help and advice on part of our presentation (which was a required thing) and he didn't get back to us for like a week, literally until the evening before the presentation and after we'd handed in the slides and couldn't change them anymore.  We're having a dilemma on whether we should phrase that problem as ""he left us Hanging."""
Bitmin,Fucking Hang
Bitmin,he was actually super nice
Bitmin,"but at the same time, he'd better be given that he left us hanging for a week and we ended up handing in slides with a few major mistakes"
Bitmin,"also, high quality google docs recognizes all of these names except one"
Bitmin,how does it recognize Sandarusi but not Mallany?
Bitmin,the glock is better than the deagle because it has more bullets
Bitmin,Is that why the zeus is the worst weapon
Bitmin,

Bitmin,True
Bitmin,Yo
Bitmin,You wanna help me code
Bitmin,Tru
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,Go away Jed

Bitmin,big group thing
Bitmin,Double baited

Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,happy birthday tomorrow bro
Bitmin,Update your steam wish llist
Bitmin,FeelsBirthdayMan
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Happy 17
Bitmin,but for real update that wishlist boiiii
Bitmin,I do not require games
Bitmin,this match is nuts
Bitmin,I've been thinking and I think its possible we will have more fun at a meetup if we don't go to an event. Does anyone else think this may be the case?
Bitmin,"the meetup might be more fun, but if I'm paying for travel and a hotel I'd prefer to get both that and an event out of it"
Bitmin,if we need to schedule it so that we can all come and it doesn't line up with an event I'm fine with that too
Bitmin,im kinda with max on this one
Bitmin,but an event would be fun tho
Bitmin,would it have to be an event with melee tho?
Bitmin,probably since that is the only game that enough of us play
Bitmin,also the only game we could enter as well as spectate
Bitmin,Someone could bring their laptop for rivals?
Bitmin,I could
Bitmin,I'm sure someone else could as well for multiple setups
Bitmin,That's be dope
Bitmin,Idk if I can come though
Bitmin,i could prolly run roa on my surface XD
Bitmin,I could bring mine
Bitmin,but me being able to go is gonna depend on a whole bunch of stuff
Bitmin,I'd need to get an internship over the summer and be able to take some time off
Bitmin,Depends on the price for me
Bitmin,well we should try to make it happen bois
Bitmin,we've been planning something like this for 1.5 years now
Bitmin,agreed
Bitmin,Yeah I'm saving up to move out though so I have to decide if I'm willing to spend
Bitmin,And set myself back
Bitmin,to move out???
Bitmin,why would you move out
Bitmin,I'll be 18 in a yeat
Bitmin,yeah but why would you want to move out
Bitmin,I'm ready to be independent
Bitmin,you've got a free home w/ utilities and food and everything
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,its not ideal but it is super practical
Bitmin,I mean basically I get rekt if my parents find out
Bitmin,So if that happens leaving will be necessary
Bitmin,it's something you should take advantage of until you have a consistent source of money that can cover your rent and food and utilities
Bitmin,Thats called addiction folks
Bitmin,Willing to alter your life for a substance
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,That's one reason
Bitmin,also that's not the definition of addiction by a long shot
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,addiction is defined by a physical and mental dependance on a substance
Bitmin,I'm aware thats not the definition
Bitmin,If I get a roommate or 2 I could cover rent rn
Bitmin,I'm just ready to be on my own
Bitmin,"also, just a recommendation, don't just drop this on your family out of the blue"
Bitmin,Idk my family is great and I love them
Bitmin,so tell them
Bitmin,don't make it a surprise
Bitmin,I will
Bitmin,or they'll be incredibly pissed
Bitmin,OR just dont and stay with them
Bitmin,Breaks over boiz
Bitmin,breaks?
Bitmin,I'm loving how all the dreamhack trophies are breaking
Bitmin,did Hbox's break?
Bitmin,someone's buying cheap trophies
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,the base came off
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,https://twitter.com/LiquidHbox/status/922288824620695553
Bitmin,sigh
Bitmin,also do you guys think hbox is #1 in world rn?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,me too
Bitmin,yeah he's going pretty ham
Bitmin,also s2j definitely top 10 at this point
Bitmin,even though I think he's boring
Bitmin,but do I really wanna play doki doki
Bitmin,also @Mr. Airplane I was on break at work
Bitmin,Play it
Bitmin,Play it
Bitmin,@The Rona How far are you?
Bitmin,This is a fun game
Bitmin,Yuri is coming over to my house today
Bitmin,hawt
Bitmin,❤
Bitmin,I chose Natsuki
Bitmin,Ew
Bitmin,We got to make cupcakes
Bitmin,so this is a dating sim?
Bitmin,it looks like one but it really isn't
Bitmin,its a psychological horror game
Bitmin,It needs to be played blind so don't look up stuff about it
Bitmin,is it a sound based game?
Bitmin,smell?
Bitmin,its a visual novel
Bitmin,do I need to provide my own blindfold?
Bitmin,how do I play a visual novel blind?
Bitmin,bad game design imo
Bitmin,you really don't need to take that out of context
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,but it was funny
Bitmin,btw @The Rona I only chose Natsuki because Sayori wasn't an option. She was my favorite.
Bitmin,why the heck is everyone so obsessed with Yuri
Bitmin,shes dumb
Bitmin,I'm not sure
Bitmin,Once everyone has completed the game I'm going to make a poll
Bitmin,Yo I read a book with Yuri ok
Bitmin,best girl poll?
Bitmin,She liked my poem
Bitmin,You do things with whichever girl liked your poem
Bitmin,So if a different one had you would have done something with her
Bitmin,shhhhhhhh
Bitmin,Maybe
Bitmin,not maybe its a fact
Bitmin,I wanted Monika but then I realised that she wasn't an option
Bitmin,;-;
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether someone fight me real quick
Bitmin,Fuck me this game
Bitmin,Oh poor doctor
Bitmin,You ain't seen nothing yet
Bitmin,how long is the game?
Bitmin,This just got super weird

Bitmin,Can it be considered growing up when Kameron's testosterone levels stay negative every year
Bitmin,"so for a big group project, we have do peer reviews where we basically give all our group members marks based on how good they were, and we have to write a paragraph or so for each of them explaining why we gave those marks"
Bitmin,which is a pain
Bitmin,but at least the sample paragraphs are hilarious
Bitmin,here are a few samples:
Bitmin,"""Candorsnaffity Hixelbröd was an annoying teammate"""
Bitmin,"""he agreed that he'd do the sushi-ionization module by Sunday afternoon"""
Bitmin,"""Prosnitau Sgrachita de la Mnirhoihoi was good, helpful and co-operative."""
Bitmin,"""V'snl'chm'tkn!k of the Fortress of Doom (that's me) was an effective worker in this
assignment"""
Bitmin,"also I just skimmed over the way you're supposed to break down marks (that I totally ignored initially), which contains this gem: A mark of seven indicates someone who leaps tall buildings in a single bound, walks on water, and solves NP-complete problems in linear time."
Bitmin,@here gamerinos anyone???
Bitmin,Yee
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak play dem games with me and birthday boi
Bitmin,@Max you too
Bitmin,gotta finish these stupid peer reviews
Bitmin,just do it later
Bitmin,boom problem solved
Bitmin,it's due tonight
Bitmin,I already left it to the last minute
Bitmin,Doki Doki is okie doki
Bitmin,     
Bitmin,same
Bitmin,"My stats prof: ""Just then, you assumed that I was telling the truth, because what I was saying was plausible.  Just like how you assume I have the credentials to teach this course."""
Bitmin,Same
Bitmin,The teachers are on strike where I live and i am not getting compensation for the missed school even though i paid for it if you guys can take like 1 minutes jsut to fill out this petition giving students compensation for missed days i will personally suck your dick and give you a high five at the same time https://www.change.org/p/college-employer-council-students-demand-a-tuition-refund-for-each-day-missed-in-case-of-an-ontario-college-strike/nftexp/ex15/v6/818679301?recruiter=818679301&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial.combo_new_control_progress_bar&utm_content=ex15%3Av6
Bitmin,Sign the Petition
Bitmin,College Employer Council: Students demand a tuition refund for each day missed in case of an Ontario college strike
Bitmin,damn they're on strike again?
Bitmin,"not as sure about college profs, but for uni and high school they have an insanely good setup"
Bitmin,"as in high pay, low hours, good benefits"
Bitmin,and they still strike
Bitmin,"the people a year older than me got screwed for uni applications cause the public school board teachers aren't legally allowed to strike, so the union just strongarmed all the teachers into stopping extracurriculars so basically everyone who was applying to post-secondary stuff had a big empty extracurricular section on all their applications"
Bitmin,the worst part is that most teachers didn't even want to do it but you can't teach in a public school without being part of the union so they had no choice
Bitmin,and the union's pretty screwed up even when no one's going on strike
Bitmin,"one of the major things is that your ability to get placed where you want is based 100% on seniority, so if you're an awful teacher who's been around for 30 years you can teach what you want, where you want, and if you're a brand new teacher living paycheck to paycheck you probably can't even get a job"
Bitmin,"one of my uncles has been a teacher for six years, he couldn't get a job for the first three years except as a substitute teacher or an LTO (long term occasional, basically if a teacher goes on maternity or sick leave for awhile he would come in and pick up a poorly documented class for a few months then he'd be out of a job again), then he got a really good slot for a year.... only to get kicked out by someone with more seniority and he had to spend the next two years at a place for kids who've been expelled or are in juvie but can't technically not get school (read: everyone's an asshole and/or doesn't give a fuck and it's in the middle of a super dangerous area) before he's finally managed to get a decent placement and who knows how long that's gonna last, cause based on their system by the end of the year he'll only have 4 years of seniority"
Bitmin,Teachers unions are just terrible
Bitmin,Looks like we agree on one more thing
Bitmin,"some unions are alright, especially in dangerous jobs (like factory work), but a) unions in public funded areas are generally terrible cause they're fairly essential services where it has a large, negative impact on society if and when they strike, b) teachers already have a pretty damn cushy gig and really, really don't need a union, and c) this union in particular has a tendancy to kinda sorta work against the best interests of its members in an attempt to make things marginally better for a small handful of them"
Bitmin,holy shit
Bitmin,I leave this chat for a couple weeks and come back to find deep discussion on politics
Bitmin,nice
Bitmin,Welcome back
Bitmin,hey boys
Bitmin,yee
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,how is mcg development going?
Bitmin,Its going good
Bitmin,Is there a new build I could play tonight?
Bitmin,ooh ooh play with me later
Bitmin,I was planning on patching it soon
Bitmin,maybe I can get the new build together today
Bitmin,yes @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,I can't now tho
Bitmin,just took an hour-long melee break
Bitmin,and I've got a midterm at 7
Bitmin,is anyone here getting destiny 2? It looks kinda gay but im down if you guys get it
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,how difficult are exams?
Bitmin,also @Max @Sak von Sak college life is crazy
Bitmin,gotta love it though
Bitmin,I just took a midterm and it was pretty easy
Bitmin,"I'm not that worried, I've done a ton of old midterms and I basically know every questions he's gonna throw at me"
Bitmin,we're allowed a cheat sheet too
Bitmin,thats OP
Bitmin,I want a cheat sheet
Bitmin,honestly I'm usually more worried about tests where they let you have a cheat sheet
Bitmin,cause that means it's hard
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,"and it's gonna be more questions testing your understanding and application than your knowledge, which is really all the cheat sheet helps with"
Bitmin,I got a cheat sheet for my math midterm and I didn't even need it
Bitmin,@Trapezoider Even if I don't make a new build today the build we are on will be new for you
Bitmin,@Trapezoider you should get a copy of the cards and make a few decks before we play
Bitmin,I sent him the pdf
Bitmin,"just to warn him tho, there's a few cards with two versions in the pdf (at least if it's the same one I've got) and a bunch of unimplemented/banned cards"
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,"from what I remember, knight, scholar, goblin, and berserker are banned atm due to being more than a little OP, there's two versions of stasis chamber (I think the actual one is the one with 1 attack), two grand arbiters (3-cost one is the real one), wild magic is banned, power cultivation might be banned, replicator is banned or at the very least it's getting removed next patch, time walk shouldn't exist anymore, and once there stop being pictures for stuff everything unimplemented"
Bitmin,at least in my version
Bitmin,Power cultivation isn't banned
Bitmin,He has the same version as you @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,oh I thought it was
Bitmin,my bad
Bitmin,Tonights games will probably be the final testing before 1.18 is implemented
Bitmin,I found another good wrastor
Bitmin,he wrecked me the first few games but I brought it back
Bitmin,The mythical good wrastor player
Bitmin,many deny the very existence of such a player
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak @Trapezoider @me when you want to play MCG and I'll set up the server
Bitmin,"I just finished my midterm, I'm gonna get a pizza (which will put me over budget for the week but fuck it I deserve a pizza) and then I'm down to play"
Bitmin,"it won't actually put me much over budget cause pizza pizza has a clutch deal - large pizza, 3 toppings, dipping sauce, $13 including tax"
Bitmin,and I can just bring the couple of leftover slices for lunch tomorrow and save some there
Bitmin,pizza pizza coming in clutch
Bitmin,@Trapezoider fight me mcg
Bitmin,@Trapezoider you're letting me down
Bitmin,@here games?
Bitmin,I'm waiting on @Trapezoider to come play mcg with me
Bitmin,he ded
Bitmin,but if he's not back by the time I'm through my pizza I'll play wiht you

Bitmin,but even if you block it I force you to waste a turn blocking it
Bitmin,and I get at least a knight and a bishop out
Bitmin,Raven ate the entire stem off of one of our pumpkins lol
Bitmin,Eww
Bitmin,Why did you just call her Raven?
Bitmin,ha
Bitmin,thats my dog's name
Bitmin,Oh
Bitmin,No that's Ava
Bitmin,Stop lying
Bitmin,I didn't mean Ava if some of you thought that
Bitmin,We all know she craves pumpkin stems
Bitmin,I totally thought you meant Ava
Bitmin,lololol
Bitmin,Yeah me too
Bitmin,I was pretty sure you meant ava
Bitmin,did ava name herself after the dog or the dog after ava?
Bitmin,Ava named her online alias after the dog

Bitmin,I wanna share my Halloween art
Bitmin,God bless my architecture prof and his wonderful curves
Bitmin,I live to study another day
Bitmin,"I finally finished persona 5 last night, man that was a game"
Bitmin,"Indeed, it is a game"
Bitmin,"I'm still cracking up that I told kameron I was halfway through the final boss at around 830, which was 100% true, and the game wasn't actually over until 11"
Bitmin,game's ending was longer than most movies
Bitmin,and it made me feel a lot of things
Bitmin,That's like the ending of Pokemon sun and moon
Bitmin,most of them good
Bitmin,I hate it when you think you are gonna beat a game
Bitmin,Then the ending takes a million hours
Bitmin,And you end up staying up all night
Bitmin,god the ending was so good though
Bitmin,@undertale
Bitmin,I wouldn't have cut any of it out
Bitmin,It's like 30+ minutes of unskipable cutscenes
Bitmin,this was about two hours
Bitmin,two glorious hours
Bitmin,What game is it sylki?
Bitmin,Nice
Bitmin,scroll up a wee bit
Bitmin,you'll see
Bitmin,Persona 5 you drunk
Bitmin,Sorry
Bitmin,I was thinking about rough completion times for most rpgs
Bitmin,and it's like
Bitmin,pokemon: 20-30 hours
Bitmin,chrono trigger: 30-35
Bitmin,chrono cross: 50ish
Bitmin,@bois I'm becoming a PI today. Get to go investigate a sketchy corp and acquire police reports and records from the capitol of my state
Bitmin,xenobladeX: 65
Bitmin,persona 3: 75
Bitmin,@wolfstein 20
Bitmin,xenoblade: 80
Bitmin,"persona 5, according to my game file, 94 hours"
Bitmin,that is insane
Bitmin,Those are looking like my CSGO hours
Bitmin,Except mine are like +60
Bitmin,So
Bitmin,Not that close actually
Bitmin,"at least on steam, the only games I've played more than 94 hours are tf2, csgo, and rivals"
Bitmin,"seriously though, incredible game"
Bitmin,and all I want to do is start again
Bitmin,try and get all the stuff I missed
Bitmin,WHOS HYPED FOR NEW WOLFENSTEIN
Bitmin,I didn't play the first one
Bitmin,there's a whole bunch
Bitmin,Oh
Bitmin,I've played none of them
Bitmin,I have also played none of them
Bitmin,"one of my favourite things about studying is coming up with really, really shitty acronyms for things, only for them to actually be useful if only because I'm amused by how terrible they are"
Bitmin,I sometimes make acronyms too
Bitmin,"current highlights are SDVE (pronounced like ""Steve""), and SCURP (which is just fun to say)"
Bitmin,bonus points to myself for figuring out the Steve thing cause the acronym has to be in that order
Bitmin,nice
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether @Cs:go games?
Bitmin,fuuuuck I missed it
Bitmin,"m2k's in toronto for canada cup, showed up to a weekly"

Bitmin,Unfortunate that you missed it
Bitmin,from what I can see m2k went pichu and won 3-0

Bitmin,"so I started a new p5 file with the intent of optimizing the shit out of it, made it like five or six hours in, and I'm now seriously considering restarting, just so that I can name myself 'Locke McLocklin'"
Bitmin,why am I like this
Bitmin,yur dumb
Bitmin,"it's like, five or six hours in a nearly hundred hour game is not all that long, and when's the next time I'm gonna have the opportunity to a) choose first and last name for a characters, and b) have the name 'Locke' be thematically appropriate?"
Bitmin,"I'm not gonna do it, cause those five or six wasted hours aren't worth the shitty joke"
Bitmin,I'll save it for if I ever run a rogue in D&D
Bitmin,"lol ""Guys, the audio seems delayed because light travels faster than sound. The stream is coming from Canada so the difference in speed is magnified."""
Bitmin,real talk the canada cup stream is messed up in so many ways right now
Bitmin,"the game audio was a good five seconds delayed for awhile, they also messed up the overlay so the sidese of the game video don't match up with the sides of the box alotted to it"

Bitmin,that was sick
Bitmin,and n0ne's playing crazy too
Bitmin,but he's against armada so he's still losing
Bitmin,he's moving tho
Bitmin,that was depressing
Bitmin,n0ne's offense was incredible
Bitmin,but armada's defense was even better
Bitmin,"like n0ne was moving insanely fast and getting really neat followups but anything that wasn't 100% guarunteed just wasn't hitting, ever"
Bitmin,"welp kage's getting m2k, rip canada"
Bitmin,@here games?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,essential if youère gonna be in this server
Bitmin,heh
Bitmin,I mean
Bitmin,okay
Bitmin,"they need to include some mix of @ here and the tags, so you can @ here + a specific game tag"
Bitmin,@Homies
Bitmin,is that better @Eric Working From Home
Bitmin,you didn't give it to yourself lol
Bitmin,I gave it to him
Bitmin,oops
Bitmin,so uh games or what?
Bitmin,watching canada cup
Bitmin,poor kage's got his third straight sheik after this
Bitmin,did he play gay sheiks before?
Bitmin,kirbykaze then android
Bitmin,"3-1, 3-1"
Bitmin,but now he's got m2k
Bitmin,who is a very different beast
Bitmin,Did you not get his joke?
Bitmin,prolly ignored cause it was a dumb joke
Bitmin,oh lol
Bitmin,that took me a few seconds
Bitmin,my god they're both nuts
Bitmin,that was way closer than I was expecting
Bitmin,"and then n0ne just kinda goes ""oh shit it's game five last stock, better turn up"""
Bitmin,honestly kage did better than I expected
Bitmin,lolol they're singing him happy birthday
Bitmin,"well top 4 is gonna be hype : armada, leffen, m2k, n0ne"
Bitmin,"lolol street fighter is doing crews, the grand finals is Team Japan 2 vs Team Japan 3"
Bitmin,"street fighter crews seem weird cause nothing carries over between matches, so it's entirely plausible to just send out your best player first and have them sweep the whole other crew"
Bitmin,rip n0ne
Bitmin,that poof kill was so sad
Bitmin,I'm personally glad to see m2k re-mastering his vs falcon game
Bitmin,"cause n0ne kept it even all the way till that, and was outplaying him after it, but he died at like 40% and he wasn't playing well enough to bring it all the way back"
Bitmin,I honestly don't feel like m2k was playing that particularly well
Bitmin,yo m2k with the quick classic - weak upsmash to tipper fsmash
Bitmin,Good to see the player I always copy copying me for once
Bitmin,yo that was awesome
Bitmin,M2K catches the close range stitch and kills armada with it
Bitmin,YESSSSSS
Bitmin,4th time
Bitmin,that was quite the pop off
Bitmin,first time ever in a game 5
Bitmin,he just vanished from the playercam for a good 5-10 seconds
Bitmin,I missed the stitch catch tho and that makes me sad
Bitmin,i dont think that there is any doubt now that hbox > armada
Bitmin,are leffen and plup gonna surpass the other 3 gods tho?
Bitmin,m2k pogchamp
Bitmin,m2k's feeling himself
Bitmin,hopefully he can keep it up for both sets
Bitmin,I think if he wins it would be his biggest win of all time
Bitmin,WHAT
Bitmin,THESE TECS
Bitmin,Repeat of the 6-0 meme?
Bitmin,OH MY GAWSH
Bitmin,HES CRAZY
Bitmin,He is definitely above plup this year if he wins
Bitmin,who?
Bitmin,m2k
Bitmin,leffen or m2k
Bitmin,possibly also leffen
Bitmin,"i mean, plup beat leffen like 4 times"
Bitmin,h2h doesn't really matter as much in melee
Bitmin,chu is up 4-1 vs m2k but no one says he should outrank him
Bitmin,this is true
Bitmin,good god m2k's going ham
Bitmin,60-40 XD
Bitmin,NA crowd
Bitmin,imo its 50-50
Bitmin,i know the crowd is chanting 60-40
Bitmin,it's weirdly stage dependant tho
Bitmin,yeah I heard
Bitmin,FD it's like 65-35 for marth
Bitmin,dream land 60-40 fox
Bitmin,"it seems like except for hbox, the top 6 is really a toss up right now"
Bitmin,m2k's going haaaaaaam
Bitmin,calm down m2k
Bitmin,Lets go 6-0
Bitmin,DAT UPSMASH THO
Bitmin,lol there's one guy cheering for leffen in the crowd
Bitmin,rip 6-0 dream
Bitmin,i cry 
Bitmin,bad melee
Bitmin,oh no
Bitmin,damn
Bitmin,LETS GOOOOOO
Bitmin,M2K
Bitmin,that was a nutty last two matches
Bitmin,summit is gonna be really hype
Bitmin,hbox v plup on stream rn
Bitmin,@Max you can not disown me anymore
Bitmin,Why?
Bitmin,cause I quit being dumb
Bitmin,What changed your mind?
Bitmin,not worth the risk
Bitmin,smart move
Bitmin,also dumped the dumb hoe
Bitmin,Was this the conservative girl?
Bitmin,well
Bitmin,politcally conservative yes
Bitmin,You know what I meant
Bitmin,yeah was clarifying
Bitmin,Welcome back
Bitmin,this was the girl who seemed kinda sketchy about the whole relationships thing?
Bitmin,she just kinda ignored me all the time
Bitmin,after I asked her out
Bitmin,"(on an unrelated note, someone in the crowd for sfv at canada cup has a massive sign that just says 'SORRY')"
Bitmin,yeah that seems like a good call
Bitmin,she didn't ignore me when I said we were done though
Bitmin,and she sent a snap of her drinking with some dude
Bitmin,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,Don't respond
Bitmin,FeelsBadMan
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,"I think that's supposed to be a ""I don't need you"" kinda thing"
Bitmin,That's what your supposed to feel
Bitmin,which is a massive dick move
Bitmin,but seeing as you kinda already figured she didn't give much of a fuck about you
Bitmin,hopefully it's not as bad
Bitmin,I know I made the right choice and had good reasons but I still feel bad
Bitmin,"not for her, just bad in general"
Bitmin,I know that feel
Bitmin,relationships are weird
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,akwardly sits with absolutely nothing to add
Bitmin,it's honestly made me kinda hesitant to try em out again
Bitmin,should probably try to get over that
Bitmin,"also max, you're at college give it a shot"
Bitmin,There is no one good
Bitmin,fair
Bitmin,I feel that
Bitmin,but you should at least try to make some friends
Bitmin,No one good... yet
Bitmin,there prolly is
Bitmin,you just always find the bad ones first
Bitmin,that's the best way to find people imo
Bitmin,damn apparently people sponsored by echo fox won all the smash events at canada cup
Bitmin,"melee singles: m2k
melee dubs: m2k leffen
sm4sh singles: mkleo
sm4sh dubs: m2k mkleo"
Bitmin,also just a really good tournament for m2k in general

Bitmin,I think I successfully built the most defensive deck ever seen
Bitmin,"I won by wearing his health down one by one (eventually two by two and for the last few turns three by three) with swarm -_-
It wasn't supposed to be like that but the deck I was against prevented me from winning in any other manner"

Bitmin,I watched Kimi no Na Wa in theatres and it made me feel strange things. So I decided to write another brain fart and see where it took me. This is the result...

Bitmin,Kotonoha no Niwa
Bitmin,"On a rainy morning in Tokyo, Takao Akizuki, an aspiring shoemaker, decides to skip class to sketch designs in a beautiful garden. This is where he meets Yukari Yukino, a beautiful yet mysterious woman, for the very first time. Offering to make her new shoes, Takao continues to meet with Yukari throughout the rainy season, and without even realizing it, the two are able to alleviate the worries hidden in their hearts just by being with each other. However, their personal struggles have not disappeared completely, and as the end of the rainy season approaches, their relationship will be put to the test. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Bitmin,Kuzu no Honkai
Bitmin,"To the outside world, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are the perfect couple. But in reality, they just share the same secret pain: they are both in love with other people they cannot be with. Hanabi has loved her childhood friend and neighbor Narumi Kanai for as long as she can remember, so she is elated to discover that he is her new homeroom teacher. However, Narumi is soon noticed by the music teacher, Akane Minagawa, and a relationship begins to blossom between them, much to Hanabi's dismay. Mugi was tutored by Akane in middle school, and has been in love with her since then. Through a chance meeting in the hallway, he encounters Hanabi. As these two lonely souls spend more time together, they decide to use each other as a substitute for the one they truly love, sharing physical intimacy with one another in order to stave off their loneliness.

Bitmin,Ouran Koukou Host Club
Bitmin,"Haruhi Fujioka is a bright scholarship candidate with no rank or title to speak of—a rare species at Ouran High School, an elite academy for students of high pedigree. When she opens the door to Music Room #3 hoping to find a quiet place to study, Haruhi unexpectedly stumbles upon the Host Club. Led by the princely Tamaki, the club—whose other members include the ""Shadow King"" Kyouya, the mischievous Hitachiin twins, and the childlike Haninozuka ""Honey"" and his strong protector Mori—is where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls in the academy. In a frantic attempt to remove herself from the hosts, Haruhi ends up breaking a vase worth eight million yen and is forced into becoming the eccentric group's general errand boy to repay her enormous debt. However, thanks to her convincingly masculine appearance, her naturally genial disposition toward girls, and fascinating commoner status, she is soon promoted to full-time male host and plunged headlong into a glitzy whirlwind of elaborate cosplays, rich food, and exciting shenanigans that only the immensely wealthy Ouran Host Club can pull off. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"
Bitmin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/245/Great_Teacher_Onizuka
Bitmin,Great Teacher Onizuka
Bitmin,"Onizuka is a reformed biker gang leader who has his sights set on an honorable new ambition: to become the world's greatest teacher... for the purpose of meeting sexy high school girls. Okay, so he's mostly reformed. However, strict administrators and a class of ruthless delinquents stand between Onizuka and his goal and they will use any means, however illegal or low, to drive the new teacher away. Perfect, because Onizuka's methods won't be found in any teaching manual; he cares about the difference between legal and illegal activities about as much as he cares for the age difference between himself and a high school girl. So get ready for math that doesn't add up, language you'd be slapped for using, and biology that would make a grown man blush... unless of course, you're the Great Teacher Onizuka.

Bitmin,Ye I'm just glad I'm alive kameron
Bitmin,@everyone in case I spontaneously die thank you all for imporving the quality of my life the last 2 years. You guys are great
Bitmin,fishtailed means that someone hit the back of your car right?
Bitmin,um
Bitmin,should we be worried?
Bitmin,he got in car crash
Bitmin,"I got that part, was mostly worried that there might be something in the aftermath"
Bitmin,but I guess he meant more in the general case of if he dies cause unforseen circumstances
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,not sudoku
Bitmin,I'm very aware right now. Of how fragile life is
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak have you been in a car crasherino?
Bitmin,I got hit by a bus while on my bike once
Bitmin,How did you not die.exe?
Bitmin,"and I distinctly remember falling towards the side/wheels, and thinking ""SHIT""  and then ""Come on man, if you die here, is that really the last thing you want to think?"""
Bitmin,Then what :0
Bitmin,and then some 30-120 second gap in my memory
Bitmin,next thing I remember is propped up against a building on the side of the road with all the people I was with gathered in a terrified semi-circle around me
Bitmin,and being sooooo deep in shock
Bitmin,We're you injured?
Bitmin,"I survived by not getting hit on, I swerved, my back wheel popped up and I spun into the side then fell off, then.... something"
Bitmin,"nothing serious, my knees have been even more screwey ever since"
Bitmin,"he ended up running over my bike, thought he'd run me over and was honestly the most relieved person in the whole event"
Bitmin,I still have the decimated bike seat
Bitmin,How long ago was this
Bitmin,"summer after grade 10, so.... 5 years ago?"

Bitmin,pubg?
Bitmin,Leffen got possibly the hardest bracket possible
Bitmin,yeah thats what the casters just said xd
Bitmin,Mango>Plup>Armada>Hbox
Bitmin,"bruh if leffen was on the other side of the bracket, then this would be ez tourney 4 plup"
Bitmin,now its ez tourney for hbox
Bitmin,unless big leff goes ham
Bitmin,but i dont think that plup can win the tourney anymore
Bitmin,Since leffen won't kill hbox for him?
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,unless mango beats hbox in winners and big leff beats him in losers
Bitmin,but that prolly wont happen
Bitmin,ez 4 the box
Bitmin,"full predictions: hbox 3-0 SFAT, Mango 3-1 Axe, Armada 3-2 wizzy, plup 3-2 leff, hbox 3-1 mango, plup 3-2 armada, hbox 3-0 plup"
Bitmin,I think armada wizzy will be a 3-0
Bitmin,yeah you're prolly right
Bitmin,hbox 4-stock pogchamp
Bitmin,so much for the 3-0
Bitmin,3-2 ecksdee
Bitmin,but my preds are already wrong
Bitmin,i thought axe's yung link would beat mango's mario
Bitmin,but it didnt
Bitmin,you still have gotten set winners correct
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,lets go wizy
Bitmin,can he do it
Bitmin,hes going ham
Bitmin,but i have to root against him
Bitmin,I don't think plup beating armada was the streak being broken because plup was top 6 at then time
Bitmin,If wizy wins its truely over
Bitmin,Why do you need to root against wizy?
Bitmin,for da predictions
Bitmin,your predictions are not worth the hype of armada losing to a non top 6
Bitmin,maybe 3-0 at that
Bitmin,yeah but upsets are only interesting in the short term
Bitmin,I think if the armada slump continues he will retire
Bitmin,look at armada's face
Bitmin,he looks depressed
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,I think he is actually gonna cry
Bitmin,CHOKE
Bitmin,armada is back
Bitmin,rip the dream
Bitmin,NOOOOOOOOOOO
Bitmin,that ending
Bitmin,wizzy beat himself that set
Bitmin,alright time for the classic salty leff v plup
Bitmin,what happened? I missed the end
Bitmin,wizzy sd'd
Bitmin,aw
Bitmin,this match is lit
Bitmin,real lit
Bitmin,the plup samus coming out?
Bitmin,well rip
Bitmin,I'm going to be studying that game later
Bitmin,honestly it was a pretty questionable choice
Bitmin,the commentators weren't lying when they said it's her worst stage in the matchup
Bitmin,I know
Bitmin,FD is my ban
Bitmin,lets go leffen
Bitmin,From my experience Sheik is even worse on FD
Bitmin,sizable leff

Bitmin,the other problem was that it was still wet
Bitmin,so I have to run their dryer and then my dryer
Bitmin,mail it to me and I'll throw it in the ocean
Bitmin,I'm not paying for oversized packaging just so I can not watch my housemate's clothes be thrown into the ocean
Bitmin,that shit's expensive
Bitmin,I mean okay
Bitmin,just know its always on option
Bitmin,cause you don't want any...
Bitmin,whenever someone leaves anything in the wahsre or dryer here it just ends up on the floor
Bitmin,@SWIRL GIRL
Bitmin,our floor is horrifyingly disgusting
Bitmin,cause our basement is just concrete and we never go down there expect to do laundry
Bitmin,and if I left it on the floor they'd have to clean it again and I'm not that heartless
Bitmin,"one time at my school I saw someone walk into the laundry room, take their load out of the washer, then found a dryer with the most amount of time on it. they just took out someone elses laundy and tossed it on the floor"
Bitmin,so they got a free dryer
Bitmin,that is amazing
Bitmin,"terrible, but amazing"
Bitmin,thank god for having my own washer/dryer
Bitmin,coin laundry was dumb
Bitmin,looks like I'm going for fast food after all
Bitmin,heh one of my groups has discovered the wonders of Professor Skillicorn

Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,I just found out that the lead singer of my favourite band has a chronic dissociative disorder that often makes him feel like he's just sort of watching his life in third person with no actual control over it
Bitmin,and it makes a lot of their lyrics make a lot more sense and also get way creepier in retrospect
Bitmin,they've got enough songs about losing control of your life and going crazy and killing yourself
Bitmin,sometimes all three at once

Bitmin,Nah
Bitmin,"I dont really know what hard drugs are, whats a DRUG?"
Bitmin,the only good experience I've had related to hard drugs is listening to a very drunk friend trying to describe what it's like to be on salvia
Bitmin,lol  sylki thinks salvia is a hard drug
Bitmin,i did salvia when i was 2
Bitmin,I mean from his description it sounded pretty insane
Bitmin,WHEN
Bitmin,I
Bitmin,WAS

Bitmin,@Homies Anyone up for L4D2?
Bitmin,"I wish, but I don't have the game. LOL"
Bitmin,we could play some MCG if you are available since I doubt anyone will show up for this
Bitmin,sure why not
Bitmin,can confirm: drunk crew battles are the hypest shit on the planet
Bitmin,Is this IRL or on a stream?
Bitmin,irl
Bitmin,some of the worst melee you've ever seen
Bitmin,but hype as shit
Bitmin,I got the fastest semi-legit zero to death of my life
Bitmin,"start of match, got drill shined, tried to cc downsmash but his shine pushed me off stage so it got treated as buffered dair, but he messed up his waveshine and also went off stage, right into my dair and died from it"
Bitmin,also no one has any ability to maintain reasonable composure
Bitmin,a guy got in my head by talking about the midterm we both did earlier in the day
Bitmin,"""Yo what architecture style did you use? you'd better of used pipe & filter or you probably failed.""
""I didn't use pipe and filter""
""Damn son you are FUUUUUUCKED"""
Bitmin,missing one question means you fail?
Bitmin,100 mark test
Bitmin,66 mark question
Bitmin,I stand by my choice of style tho
Bitmin,is this the one where failing means you fail the course?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,but I'm pretty sure implicit invocation will work jsut fine
Bitmin,so missing that one question will cost you the course
Bitmin,hypothetically
Bitmin,but there's a lot of bits
Bitmin,getting the wrong style won't make me fail
Bitmin,also I'm pretty sure my style is just as valid
Bitmin,if you care for a slightly more coherant answer ask me tomorrow
Bitmin,okay
Bitmin,"@Rotomotorz REMINDER IN CASE YOU MISSED MY FIRST MESSAGE: Andrew's address is 15631 Quince Trace Terrace, be there by 7:50"

Bitmin,I mean I don't think I'm an bad person now?
Bitmin,didn't you see ? now you're a neutral person
Bitmin,"We couldn't think of anyone else to put in that slot so essentially think of this as ""old Jed"""
Bitmin,Aight
Bitmin,"just saw this on an ad, this is some unfortunate comma use
""Kelly reveals how burning incense, a pet cockatoo, and a family heirloom keeps her connected to generations of strong women."""
Bitmin,lmao
Bitmin,Of course max puts himself at the top
Bitmin,Ava agreed that I go there
Bitmin,Bias news
Bitmin,I would like you to offer someone who fits it better
Bitmin,i vote mrd
Bitmin,also there's not really a 'top' for this kind of thing
Bitmin,or dadlast
Bitmin,mrd tried to cheat in mcg yesterday
Bitmin,lawful good just means you follow a strict code of ethics that is generally good
Bitmin,"also my quote is wrong. It should be ironically ""My only goal in life is to respect all whamen"
Bitmin,more like put your dick in all of them  am I right
Bitmin,nah
Bitmin,that is not optimal
Bitmin,"I personally believe that the way I behave as a person makes be the best possible fit for lawful good, although I think my dad could fit it too, we just didn't put him on the chart because he isn't really a part of this server."
Bitmin,I'm with max on this one
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,as soon as I saw that there was an alignment chart the only two ones I knew for sure were max on lawful good and kameron on true neutral
Bitmin,those were the first 2 we did
Bitmin,max
Bitmin,go ask your dad if I can play factorio with him
Bitmin,hes on rn lol
Bitmin,okay I guess
Bitmin,just a sec
Bitmin,he says maybe another day
Bitmin,@Max do you think pirating is fine if you've already owned a copy of the game?
Bitmin,yeet
Bitmin,Do you own it currently?
Bitmin,I am downloading sid meier's pirates
Bitmin,its from 2005
Bitmin,you can buy that on steam
Bitmin,and I know we have the disc somewhere I just can't find it and I'm lazy
Bitmin,yeah I can
Bitmin,or he could not
Bitmin,but I already own the game
Bitmin,and save money on a game his dad owns
Bitmin,then go look for it
Bitmin,mighta got lost when we moved a couple years ago
Bitmin,lol rip
Bitmin,but if I already purchased the game once
Bitmin,is it wrong for me to download it somewhere else
Bitmin,I mean I would probably buy it since its really cheap but in this case I say do what you want
Bitmin,its $10
Bitmin,thats nothing
Bitmin,rich boi
Bitmin,yeah it is
Bitmin,$ 10 bucks
Bitmin,thats like a third tank of gas
Bitmin,I mean I'm not buying it again  just asking what you though
Bitmin,*1/4 a tank
Bitmin,not for meeeee
Bitmin,i fill up for 30
Bitmin,then you have a smaller tank
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,but I can go a week+
Bitmin,so its guchi
Bitmin,"builds a new gaming pc to play good looking games, spends hours on a game from 2005"
Bitmin,is retarded
Bitmin,boys lets play some gaymes
Bitmin,isn't a mooch ;)
Bitmin,Pirates is a good game
Bitmin,
Bitmin,ooh but what do I name myself tho
Bitmin,also English ftw
Bitmin,My name will be Carl Okson
Bitmin,KArl
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,yeah?
Bitmin,I motion for an amendment of the allignment chart
Bitmin,"I say bitmin should be chaotic evil, and I should be neutral evil"
Bitmin,I suggested that but Ava insisted it stay how it is
Bitmin,Facsism is worse than ironically disrespecting whamen
Bitmin,"also he says ""kind of"" a facist"
Bitmin,I DID NOT
Bitmin,also its just a joke so it doesn't really matter
Bitmin,I'll change yours if you can come up with something better that still fits chaotic neutral
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Love this game
Bitmin,"How dare you attack English ships! For whatever reason, when I played that game I never attacked the English (I was English myself)."
Bitmin,I don't
Bitmin,oh is that your fleet?
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,Glory to the crown
Bitmin,get to a port
Bitmin,Nah I had to divide the plunder
Bitmin,Am rebuolding
Bitmin,I'm already an English duke
Bitmin,nice
Bitmin,difficulty?
Bitmin,The third one up I think? I've been advancing each time I divide plunder
Bitmin,"If faschism were the measure for making someone ""evil"", which I don't think it is (but thats sorta besides the point), wouldent that be characterised closer to lawful ""evil"" rather than chaotic ""evil"" seeing as it usually leads to rules set in place that are very strict and follow a more lawful form of lifestyle or government(regardless of whether its better or not) rather than chaotic ?"
Bitmin,I agree with this reasoning
Bitmin,well since I'm lawful with the real law I get lawful evil
Bitmin,"lawful evil just means you follow a set of guidelines, not necessarily the law"
Bitmin,"a mass murderer who only kills blond men under 5'3"" is lawful evil"
Bitmin,a law-abiding asshole who's just generally a dick to everyone would not be lawful evil (probably neutral evil)
Bitmin,idk how much i agree with that
Bitmin,"having a standard for who you murder isnt exactly ""lawful"""
Bitmin,"among the two of us, I'm the one who's actually played D&D"
Bitmin,and has had the alignments explained in a lot of detail
Bitmin,"oh, does it?"
Bitmin,did not kn o w
Bitmin,well its too late and its a meme anyway
Bitmin,"lawful normally aligns with the law (particularly lawful good), but that's mainly due to the law being a pre-existing set of moral rules"
Bitmin,"chaotic generally is following your instincts for good/evil, not having a 'code' that you follow, and placing more value on an individual's choice"
Bitmin,the whole lawful vs chaotic thing can also be framed in terms of order vs freedom
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Facism as a social system has only brought suffering and death to the masses
Bitmin,"things I learned today: there is a toronto melee player whose tag is 'DACDACBRUCE', a tag that makes even less sense when you realize that his actual name is jonathan"
Bitmin,Guys it's cornpop
Bitmin,ew
Bitmin,https://gyazo.com/2a171262638abf8dd0071a72902879c1

Bitmin,and im like bruh why do i gotta Sim is its not like stat weights change from person to person
Bitmin,"and these mongs are like ""yeah that do"" like shit thought we were playing hte same class forgot blizzard made it so everyones class is different depending on whos playing it"
Bitmin,"and then later some guy in the discord got an achievement and i said Grats and these mongs are all like ""oh look whos back bet he wants to know the stat weights again"""
Bitmin,like these fucking monkeys
Bitmin,go play ret pally get off feral im surprised you even have the brain power to operate this spec
Bitmin,you dont get that last part
Bitmin,dw basically ret paladin is for braindead monkeys and feral is the hardest spec in the game to play
Bitmin,I understand nothing you just said
Bitmin,Stat whore
Bitmin,:p
Bitmin,bruh i jsut wanted to setup my pawn so it would tell me what gear is better
Bitmin,and in High level WoW raiding you gotta stat whore everything

Bitmin,"Who we make a gift box for, for a set amount of money"
Bitmin,Then mail it off in time for Christmas

Bitmin,I think it would be nice because we all know what most of us like and could make cool gift boxes
Bitmin,Ye me too. @Sak von Sak you in Philip medianson?

Bitmin,yee
Bitmin,"I'll ask Ava, max, doc, and chikonN tonight"

Bitmin,I'd be down
Bitmin,Join up?
Bitmin,"get in here, we're starting"
Bitmin,kk gimme a sec
Bitmin,Salt has infused itself with my dna
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Fuck me 
Bitmin,That's your chance
Bitmin,slide into those DMs
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,Is this your ex or something?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,here's the story
Bitmin,this chick on halloween was dared to kiss me during truth or dare
Bitmin,and she did and she was like apologizing a bunch about it bein awkward
Bitmin,and I was the one who was driving her home and so like in my car she was still talking about it XD and I said well oh we'll have to try it again sometime then
Bitmin,so after that we talk a lot over snapchat and hang out at school and stuff
Bitmin,and then 2 fridays ago we hung out outside of school and before I took her home we kinda just looked at each other and made out
Bitmin,so that was chill everything was good
Bitmin,after that we talked about where we were at and I said I wanted to go out with her but she said she wasn't ready for a relationship yet but that she wanted to date me
Bitmin,so i was like chill I can wait
Bitmin,fast forward to this last friday
Bitmin,was 10/10 stoned with trap and another friend
Bitmin,I was talking with her and sent a snap that said I really like you or something like that
Bitmin,and she responds with a long ass snap about how she isn't ready for a relationship and that she couldn't ever see us being more than friends
Bitmin,and then today she posted that
Bitmin,"also, saturday she went back to snapping me like we never even had the conversation"
Bitmin,idk lifes a bitch
Bitmin,"no, she is xd"
Bitmin,Women are weird sometimes my dude
Bitmin,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitmin,Yo
Bitmin,hit her up
Bitmin,be like
Bitmin,what's the deal
Bitmin,??
Bitmin,see if I do that she's gonna be all pissy and be like oh I thought you were more mature than that
Bitmin,I'm probably gonna end up doing that tho
Bitmin,haha true
Bitmin,we'll see how high I get
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitmin,"Yo just man up, do it without the green"
Bitmin,I'm not sure if I want to lose the friendship tho
Bitmin,Idk man
Bitmin,Low-key wanna comment in her post like then just go get a boyfriend there are lots of guys it there right?
Bitmin,@The Rona is that roast good enough?
Bitmin,It's not terrible
Bitmin,Make sure that you have every word spelt correctly though if you do post that
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I feel like it's just passive aggressive enough to get away with
Bitmin,I'm bouta fuck myself over prolly but it's finr
Bitmin,Yeah who cares
Bitmin,The only reason that the friendship exists in the first place is because of romantic interest
Bitmin,"Without that, there's not really a point is there?"
Bitmin,I guess the eventual hopes of her liking me again is the main motive
Bitmin,"That's probably the hardest part, not gonna lie"
Bitmin,I'ma comment it
Bitmin,Whatever happens happens
Bitmin,I say go for it
Bitmin,She could either see it as funny and hit you up or see you as a dick
Bitmin,So
Bitmin,It's done
Bitmin,It's whatever
Bitmin,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitmin,Life goes on
Bitmin,haha
Bitmin,C'est la vie
Bitmin,Lmao the response is already in 
Bitmin,No way
Bitmin,"""I don't appreciate your salty ass comment"""
Bitmin,I haven't opened it yet but that's what it says
Bitmin,Did she dm that to you?
Bitmin,Yeah over snap
Bitmin,How do you know what it says??
Bitmin,Gonna bring up not ready for a relationship probably
Bitmin,If you don't slide it all the way you can read the right most text
Bitmin,I see
Bitmin,"It would have been kinda funny if you commented ""Sorry, I'm not ready for a relationship"" "
Bitmin,Yours was better though
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,Damn she's gonna block me from her sinsta
Bitmin,Rip
Bitmin,Oh well
Bitmin,At least my music is lit
Bitmin,people who block over stupid things are honestly the worst
Bitmin,But she is the best
Bitmin,;~;
Bitmin,Okay but she probably isn't the best but for some reason I think she is and I feel like doing dumb shit like commenting will make her not be my friend anymore
Bitmin,And maybe I will stop being obsessed with her if I have a reason to be angry at her
Bitmin,Jed
Bitmin,This is what dating Hatcher felt like. Don't get cucked buddy. She may seem like the best thing on Earth right now. But she's being a huge jerk. Stand up for yourself and don't take shit from anyone
Bitmin,"Yeah, if she acts this petty over one little comment, she ain't worth your time"
Bitmin,Please help save net neutrality https://www.battleforthenet.com
Bitmin,Comcast wants to control what you do online. Do you want to let them?

Bitmin,Tru
Bitmin,Yo the punisher is lit
Bitmin,Yee
Bitmin,I'm on episode 7
Bitmin,"While doing research for an essay I'm writing, I came across an idea which is so simple yet I believe could revolutionize the way our government works and I had to share it. What if we made all political donations fully anonymous. If you want to see the full article, PM me with your email addess and I'll send it to you."
Bitmin,Wow that sounds like a great idea
Bitmin,why can't you just link the article
Bitmin,@foreinggovernmentswhowoulddonatebillionstofundnationalpolicythrouhgcandtidatestheyliked
Bitmin,its on a scholarly database which is restricted
Bitmin,"basic reasoning behind why that doesn't work is the 'anonymous' bit - the politician just sees the money, not who its from or any messages"
Bitmin,Can you give me the rundown of how this would affect the government?
Bitmin,and anyone could claim to have been the donator and there's no real way to prove who it actually was
Bitmin,helps stop people from giving politicians monetary incentive to support or oppose legislature
Bitmin,"don't feel like rewriting the article or debating it rn, just PM me your email if you want it"
Bitmin,"Send me the article max and I will see if I agree with this.. It sounds like an interesting notion, although my natural reaction is to oppose this."
Bitmin,I will read it tomorrow
Bitmin,I NEED YOUR EMAIL FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME
Bitmin,You have my email dork from google docs
Bitmin,On all the stuff we have collaborated on
Bitmin,andrewjp42@gmail.com
Bitmin,Like atlanta docs last year
Bitmin,also is atlanta 2.0 still on?
Bitmin,it would be DC
Bitmin,when?
Bitmin,summer 2018
Bitmin,no more detail currently
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplanes house?
Bitmin,thats the goal
Bitmin,okay
Bitmin,keep me informed
Bitmin,I need to procure certain amounts of funds into my savings account
Bitmin,yeah cause I need to start looking at costs now
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane
Bitmin,make us some waffles
Bitmin,please
Bitmin,❤
Bitmin,pancakes are better
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane make us pancakes instead
Bitmin,proper waffles are better imo
Bitmin,FALSE
Bitmin,they hold toppings way better
Bitmin,I'm more into crepes
Bitmin,#teampancake
Bitmin,waffles are superior
Bitmin,crepes are pretty damn good
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak dont let them decieve you
Bitmin,#team crepes
Bitmin,waffles are good but theres nothing better than a big fluffy sweet pancake
Bitmin,but in the waffles vs pancakes debate waffles are clearly superior
Bitmin,n0
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,waffles >= crepes > pancakes
Bitmin,"but like,,"
Bitmin,you cant cook things into waffles
Bitmin,"@Trapezoider We have not had a proper conversation on meaningful topics in a long time, you should join up discord for games/discussion more often."
Bitmin,yeah you totally can
Bitmin,itll be all burnt n gross
Bitmin,http://www.strawpoll.me/14455790
Bitmin,Which is better?
Bitmin,Vote Now! [Waffles] [Pancakes]
Bitmin,never happened to me
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I prefer to eat lunch food anyways
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,pancakes have superior texture and flavor
Bitmin,I concur
Bitmin,not a fan of breakfast food
Bitmin,false
Bitmin,PICK ONE THO MAX
Bitmin,flavour? they're like 99% the exact same ingredients
Bitmin,Can we objecitvely prove which is better?
Bitmin,pancakes
Bitmin,OH SHIT FAMILY BETRAYAL
Bitmin,if we are talking highest quality waffles vs. highest quality pancakes waffles take it
Bitmin,i mean I guess but theres something about waffles thats kinda off putting
Bitmin,me and ava both chose pancakes
Bitmin,like theres a flavor there thats just  ? ? ?
Bitmin,eh
Bitmin,oh whoops
Bitmin,how do i describe it
Bitmin,"the only thing offputting about waffles is how much better they are than pancakes, given that they're the exact same thing cooked in a slightly different manner"
Bitmin,DIE
Bitmin,FALSE
Bitmin,they're like weirdly more bitter
Bitmin,nah
Bitmin,dude
Bitmin,maybe because theyre cooked more harshly
Bitmin,then you're just screwing up your pancake making
Bitmin,like who even cares to debate something as meaningless as this
Bitmin,like everyone in this discord
Bitmin,wait how? I want my pancakes to be sweeter
Bitmin,waffles with strawberry compote is the best way to wake up on a saturday
Bitmin,also I take my food very seriously
Bitmin,this is serious business!!
Bitmin,I have trash taste in food so I just eat what I like and keep to myself
Bitmin,"waffles with strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream, and maple syrup (like actual maple syrup, not whatever weird shenanagins like corn syrup that you guys have in the states) is honestly unbelievably good"
Bitmin,all that with pancakes instead of waffles is better imo
Bitmin,I guess we'll have to agree to disagree
Bitmin,naw cause with pancakes all the syrup and stuff doesn't stay on
Bitmin,I am a fan of fruit syrups personally
Bitmin,I mean don't get me wrong maple syrup is still hella good
Bitmin,pancakes soak up syrup better
Bitmin,"fruit syrup's alright, but it's not as good as actual maple syrup"
Bitmin,you can mix 'em and get some good combinations tho
Bitmin,truth
Bitmin,waffles soaked in syrup are a weird combo of hard and squishy
Bitmin,pancakes are soft and nice
Bitmin,
Bitmin,why is that a video XD
Bitmin,why did you make me download that
Bitmin,eat my waffles filled bootyhole
Bitmin,@HalfCentaur
Bitmin,@Trapezoider plane tickets are 358 round trip to dc
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,can u afford
Bitmin,that will go down after holidays?
Bitmin,I mean
Bitmin,probably not
Bitmin,plane ticket prices can vary greatly over time so be sure to keep checking
Bitmin,they might be jacking up all prices since its around holidays
Bitmin,also tristan
Bitmin,can prolly hook us up with good deals
Bitmin,I looked at dates in the summer tho
Bitmin,if you book farther in advance itll be cheaper I think
Bitmin,they can't do that right now though since we don't know when it'll be

Bitmin,Kameron can afford a bunch of couches because he sells drugs
Bitmin,"Oh no, I've been found out"
Bitmin,Gotta move to South America now
Bitmin,actually I think you've mixed up cause and effect - he has to afford all the couches to store his drugs
Bitmin,Check out your supply?
Bitmin,"Kameron, take me with you"
Bitmin,Going to Columbia?
Bitmin,yo why the fuck did it have to allocate 50 gigs if the game is actually only 26.6gb?

Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane are you still boosting me
Bitmin,Okay @Max
Bitmin,sure
Bitmin,@Homies
Bitmin,games?
Bitmin,what game?
Bitmin,idk
Bitmin,@Trapezoider Are you going to want to melee soon?
Bitmin,@Max @Jed @The Rona csgo in 15?
Bitmin,I'll play
Bitmin,is fusion going to play to make it 5?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,@Trapezoider csgo with us?
Bitmin,@The Rona where you at
Bitmin,welp
Bitmin,my thermostat is broken again
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,sad
Bitmin,fucking thing lasted like two weeks
Bitmin,warranty?
Bitmin,"leading me to assume that it's either a) a faulty model in general, or b) something wacky's going on with the electricity through that particular bit that's causing the thermostat to keep fucking up"
Bitmin,it's all handled and paid for by my landlord
Bitmin,cause the lease more or less legally compels him to give us a functioning house
Bitmin,"on an unrelated note, I think I might have gotten weirdly good at sm4sh falcon"
Bitmin,that or the fact that me and the guy I was playing had a combined seven hours of sleep made everything dumb work
Bitmin,@max
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,yeah?
Bitmin,Smash?
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak you mean your sleep + his sleep was 7 hours?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,I had three hours he had four
Bitmin,K finishing one more run through of moonlight sonata third movement then running upstairs
Bitmin,3.5 mins
Bitmin,when is your crew battle thing sylki?
Bitmin,over
Bitmin,we didn't get anything on stream
Bitmin,how did it go?
Bitmin,which I'm super grateful for because I played like a rusty trash can
Bitmin,we went 0-2
Bitmin,but we still go the next round cause top 4 teams make it out and there were only 4 teams
Bitmin,so I've got time to remember how to play the game
Bitmin,so hopefully next time I don't lose six stocks and only take three
Bitmin,double elimination crews are weird
Bitmin,especially cause there was a grand finals reset
Bitmin,so it was like an hour and a half long
Bitmin,"melee crews were hype tho, unfortunately we didn't have a crew cause we couldn't get enough interest "
Bitmin,but I got to watch one crew's anchor take 12 stocks (that I saw) and lose the battle by one stock
Bitmin,Good luck next round!
Bitmin,our second match was kinda funny cause we lost by one stock and every single member of our crew is blaming themselves for not getting one more stock
Bitmin,"""I had a good read on him but I let him get too much of a lead early on""
""I misinput a kill throw and dropped a stock cause of it and then my next game forgot how to fight ryu until I was already on last stock at death percent""
""I went too deep when I was making a comeback and could have taken that last stock""
""I SD'd at under 50% when the other guy was last stock at 130%""
""I choked under the last stock pressure, the full knees weak arms heavy mom's spaghetti experience"""
Bitmin,which one is you?
Bitmin,the second
Bitmin,"although in afterthough I actually messed up the order, second and third should be swapped"
Bitmin,my back throw that was supposed to be upthrow was on the last stock of the almost comeback

Bitmin,"When an Emishi village is attacked by a fierce demon boar, the young prince Ashitaka puts his life at stake to defend his tribe. With its dying breath, the beast curses the prince's arm, granting him demonic powers while gradually siphoning his life away. Instructed by the village elders to travel westward for a cure, Ashitaka arrives at Tatara, the Iron Town, where he finds himself embroiled in a fierce conflict: Lady Eboshi of Tatara, promoting constant deforestation, stands against Princess San and the sacred spirits of the forest, who are furious at the destruction brought by the humans. As the opposing forces of nature and mankind begin to clash in a desperate struggle for survival, Ashitaka attempts to seek harmony between the two, all the while battling the latent demon inside of him. Princess Mononoke is a tale depicting the connection of technology and nature, while showing the path to harmony that could be achieved by mutual acceptance. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Bitmin,love you all
Bitmin,bruh you gotta do the kings of summer
Bitmin,its fucking hilarious
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,also fuck you
Bitmin,oh my b @Mr. Airplane thought you were trap
Bitmin,Why does who it is matter?
Bitmin,cause trap told his mom
Bitmin,Did you get in trouble?
Bitmin,did I get in fucking trouble
Bitmin,lmao
Bitmin,is that a question
Bitmin,"Yo, that's actually dick"
Bitmin,I'm going to counselling now no phone no car
Bitmin,prolly transfering schools
Bitmin,rip dc?
Bitmin,and on top of that my parents told my little brothers that I was making bad choices and my brother asked if I was gonna kill him
Bitmin,idk
Bitmin,we'll see if I'm even around then
Bitmin,don't kill yourself
Bitmin,you should become a therapist max
Bitmin,"I'm to brutally honest for that, I would be a much better life coach."
Bitmin,WHOOSH
Bitmin,ya know what that is
Bitmin,@Trapezoider what the fuck man
Bitmin,thats the sound the joke makes as it goes right over your head
Bitmin,wait hold up @The Chief Apple what happened dude
Bitmin,parents found my shit
Bitmin,did trap intentionally get you in trouble?
Bitmin,idk all I know is he told his mom that he smoked with me
Bitmin,snap dude
Bitmin,and that I peer pressured him  into it
Bitmin,atleast thats what I heard
Bitmin,so whats happening with your parents then?
Bitmin,idk man
Bitmin,no car
Bitmin,phone is being watched
Bitmin,counseling
Bitmin,and they might try to make me quit my job
Bitmin,geez
Bitmin,yeet
Bitmin,love my family
Bitmin,that sucks dude
Bitmin,my brother asking if I was gonna kill him is the worst part
Bitmin,like fuck
Bitmin,I'ma take a long walk tonight and see where I'm at
Bitmin,hopefully everything works out ok my dude
Bitmin,we'll see
Bitmin,oh yeah
Bitmin,I am probably getting transferred back to my old school at some point too
Bitmin,they almost called the police instead of talking to me about it too
Bitmin,well at least they didn't do that
Bitmin,they threatened that if I don't do exactly what they say they still will get police involved
Bitmin,so I have that hanging over me
Bitmin,which is nice
Bitmin,That's honestly stupid
Bitmin,Not gonna lie
Bitmin,I dont understand how parents can say something like that
Bitmin,you right
Bitmin,I mean you're their kid
Bitmin,so hey anyone have an extra bed 
Bitmin,do they not realize how that makes somebody feel?
Bitmin,but like real shit even ignoring the fact that you're their son who the fuck calls the police on someone for smoking weed
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,ESPECIALLY if they're your kid tho
Bitmin,well obv
Bitmin,"just got caught up on this, seems pretty dumb"
Bitmin,I mean I knew the risk
Bitmin,but still
Bitmin,they're still overreacting
Bitmin,it seems like they're handling this poorly
Bitmin,^understatement of the day^
Bitmin,what is the right way to handle something like this then?
Bitmin,oh shit man you smoke weed
Bitmin,like dont
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,"some things they did wasn't unreasonable, but transferring schools is hella dumb"
Bitmin,give an ultimatum before going all in on the reform
Bitmin,"I mean, yeah octo's parents are going super far but I don't think just saying ""don't do that"" is going to change anything"
Bitmin,"you don't decide someone's making bad life decisions, don't force them into worse places"
Bitmin,help them get somewhere better
Bitmin,well i mean its not like hes making terrible life choices that will ruin his future forever
Bitmin,"like ""if you CONTINUE to do this then we'll make you move schools"""
Bitmin,smoking weed is pretty lax
Bitmin,was talking from his parents' perspective
Bitmin,yeah but it is illegal at his age so its not a great idea
Bitmin,I mean there is no ultimatum
Bitmin,its all of the above
Bitmin,"no car, quit your job, go to counseling, possibly switch schools"
Bitmin,the parts of that that are at least partially reasonable - counselling
Bitmin,not really anything else
Bitmin,that quit your job part like what is that supposed to accomplish
Bitmin,unless it's their car that they're letting you use
Bitmin,but not any counseling
Bitmin,Christian counseling
Bitmin,I think it's so he doesn't have money to buy weed -_-
Bitmin,oh lord jesus
Bitmin,save that for the christian counseling jed
Bitmin,but like... a major part of traditional rehabilitation for stuff like this is to get a job so you become a productive person
Bitmin,^^^^^^^^^
Bitmin,but thats the thing
Bitmin,I smoke
Bitmin,but I am also a very productive highschooler
Bitmin,I have good grades
Bitmin,and a job
Bitmin,"""hey you seem like a really good kid, lets change that so that you stop smoking"""
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,like literally taking away everything I've worked to get my life in a decent place
Bitmin,gone
Bitmin,my advice would be to wait till they've cooled off a bit and then talk to them about it in this context
Bitmin,there is no talking to them
Bitmin,my parents are close minded retards
Bitmin,you'll probably have to take some other punishment but if you can keep the stuff that makes your life better it's worth it
Bitmin,my life was kinda already shitty before this
Bitmin,now there isn't gonna be really anything
Bitmin,fuck
Bitmin,I dunno what to say man
Bitmin,
Bitmin,how would switching your school even help the issue?
Bitmin,"if they do force you into counselling talk to your counsellor about this stuff, if you can convince them that moving schools and making you quit is bad, they might be able to get your parents to back off a little"
Bitmin,^ the counselling part might be a blessing not a curse
Bitmin,just try not to see them as the enemy even if they're trying to make you a perfect little christian
Bitmin,fuck counseling
Bitmin,they've tried to make me go before
Bitmin,try to get the counsellor on your side for this
Bitmin,if you treat him like trash he'll just tell your parents you're an incorrigible shit and they'll punish you more
Bitmin,there is literally nothing more they can do to punish me
Bitmin,they've listed literally everything I enjoy or do
Bitmin,well if it can't get worse why not try to make things slightly less bad
Bitmin,I guess except for my pc
Bitmin,idk
Bitmin,it literally cannot hurt you
Bitmin,I wholeheartedly agree with sylki
Bitmin,yeah you guys are prolly right I'm just still pissed
Bitmin,fuck I was gonna study for the SAT tonight
Bitmin,go for that walk
Bitmin,oh well
Bitmin,walks are nice
Bitmin,I can't
Bitmin,walk around the house if you have to
Bitmin,I have to wait for everyone to0 go to bed cause I'm on house arrest
Bitmin,pace the house if you must
Bitmin,moving helps calm down
Bitmin,and at worse it's a passive agressive way to keep your parents awake
Bitmin,although that might not be a good thing

Bitmin,"another contender for best clip (can't find it tho) is that time ice waveshined armada all the way across battlefield and back, then armada hit him with one downsmash and it put them back at even percents"
Bitmin,my favorite falco clip https://youtu.be/Jl4KkCyVFNo?t=11m8s
Bitmin,"Top 10 ""Armada Getting Rekt"" Moments"
Bitmin,"Includes notable set losses or memorable ""bodied"" moments. The final clip was mislabeled. It is the #1 clip, not the #4 as it says. VOD Sources: 10. Armada v..."

Bitmin,It's been like 8 hours
Bitmin,try some breathing excersizes
Bitmin,If I didn't already know that I have a thing where I'm hypersensitive to my heart rate I'd be super worried
Bitmin,But it's making sleep a bitch
Bitmin,Breathing exercises have helped a bit but only temporarily
Bitmin,heart can't beat if you stop breathing
Bitmin,show your heart whos boss
Bitmin,-_-
Bitmin,go to a hospital lol
Bitmin,jk
Bitmin,one time my friends tried to convince me to smoke some green marijuana. My heart was beating like crazy
Bitmin,If I'm still having problems come morning I might stop by the drop in clinic on campus
Bitmin,But for now I'm 95% sure it's just the caffeine messing stuff up a bit coupled with the hyperawareness
Bitmin,"Cause it feeds on itself - I notice my heart rate increasing, stresses me out, heart rate increases more"
Bitmin,I've gotten it looked at and I know it's harmless (it's basically entirely mental) but it's still super uncomfortable

Bitmin,That too
Bitmin,WAIT YOH ARE MAKING MINESWEEPER LOL. @Max
Bitmin,Play his mine sweeper clone
Bitmin,I was the one who got Max into Minesweeper 
Bitmin,What graphics are you using for the game?
Bitmin,Wait really? Is he better than you now?
Bitmin,There's not really a lot of graphics in minesweeper
Bitmin,everything can just be drawn with code
Bitmin,What language are you doing this in ?
Bitmin,processing
Bitmin,I'm retarded and have never heard of that
Bitmin,Smh
Bitmin,Don't worry
Bitmin,no one has
Bitmin,Is it new?
Bitmin,Or SUPER old
Bitmin,Probably new-ish
Bitmin,What advantages does it have over other languages?
Bitmin,I couldn't tell you
Bitmin,:/ I think yours and other people's ability to program is so cool
Bitmin,It's super simple to learn
Bitmin,You guys are going to be the ones with all the power in this brave New world of ours
Bitmin,I always am so sloppy when I code. I make so many redundancies and no one understands what in doing because I get so disorganized
Bitmin,What course is mine sweeper for ?
Bitmin,My intro to computer programming course
Bitmin,This is my final project
Bitmin,Are you majoring comp sci?
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,Science
Bitmin,Just a science major? Nothing specific?
Bitmin,"For now, yes"

Bitmin,I'm from Ontario
Bitmin,Waterloo is like an hour from my house
Bitmin,@The Rona You have to let me try your version of minesweeper

Bitmin,"@Trapezoider You are always interested in how people learn things so I thought I would share the order in which I learned things in melee (to the best of my memory).
1.    Pick a main (Marth)
2.    Learn basic tech and combos
3.    Switch mains (Sheik)
4.    Switch mains (Jigglypuff)
5.    Learn basic Fox tech
6.    Switch mains (Fox)
7.    Learn the Fox matchup
8.    Learn intermediate Fox tech
9.    Learn the Luigi matchup
(I believe I met you sometime around here)
10.    Acquire a secondary (Sheik)
11.    Learn the Marth matchup
12.    Learn the Sheik matchup
13.    Learn the Samus Matchup
14.    Learn Advanced Fox tech
15.    Acquire another secondary (Falco)
16.    Learn the Captain Falcon matchup
17.    Learn the Falco Matchup"

Bitmin,"I know basically no one here likes sad songs, but I found this song like fourty five minutes ago and I've been listening to it on loop since and I wanted to share. Even in sad songs it's hard to find songs where they're sung with as much emotion as this one (a lot of the time it's just a sad melody and instrumentals). For those of you who don't feel like listening through the whole thing, the best part is from around 2:30 onwards

Bitmin,
Bitmin,When you say illest is that a typo or just some new slang I have yet to hear?
Bitmin,illest
Bitmin,it's like saying something's sick
Bitmin,as in its sick
Bitmin,sick = ill
Bitmin,does counting crows have any popular songs? cause I feel like I've heard of them before
Bitmin,I've probably brought them up a few times (they're one of my favourite bands)
Bitmin,I think I've heard of them too.
Bitmin,but their best known songs are probably Mr. Jones and Accidentally In Love (which was in one of the shrek movies)
Bitmin,I know them from Mr. Jones. My mom has played that song in the car so many times.
Bitmin,"Mr. Jones has over 147,000,000 plays on spotify so i guess you could say its popular "
Bitmin,oh damn lol
Bitmin,that's a lot

Bitmin,wiat holy shit they did the original big yellow taxi
Bitmin,I've only ever heard the cover and assumed it was the og
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,I must be a defective person because songs having emotion in them is often actively undesirable for me.
Bitmin,I like voices to be just another instrument and not bring any human aspect.

Bitmin,my boy Ron Pope is good
Bitmin,also holy cow he's changed his look so much
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"Sad Songs: Sullivan Street, The Long December, I Wish I Was a Girl, Goodnight L.A., Holiday in Spain, Black and Blue, Possibility Days, Raining in Baltimore (if you're in the mood for a song that's just straight up depressed)
Not Sad Songs (at least musically): Mr. Jones, Rain King, Murder of One, Come Around, Miami, Insignificant, Cowboys, Shallow Days, American Girls, Daylight Fading, Recovering the Satellites

If you like listening to albums, I haven't listened through all their stuff (hence how I just found Possibility Days), but here's a rough breakdown of the ones I do know:
August and Everything After - mostly sad songs/ballads, overall their best album, only one song on it I don't actively like (ghost train)
Hard Candy - more energetic/rock-like, still has some sad songs, but more songs I don't really like (good time, new frontier, carriage) , and apparently there's a deluxe version that has a few songs I haven't heard yet and I should probably check that out at some point. Probably my 2nd favourite overall.
Recovering the Satellites - chill rock, a lot of good songs but not many phenomenal ones. Third best.
Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings - starts out very heavy on a sort of heavy alt-rock sound that I don't really like, then it hits some good sad songs and then mellows out for the end. Each song is kinda hit-or-miss but there are some really good ones. Would be higher if it didn't have as many songs I don't like."
Bitmin,wow this is super in depth
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,Is this all by counting crows?

Bitmin,Or there is a probability she has a concussion.
Bitmin,"""i fell"" is a pretty bad excuse for a concussion"
Bitmin,Yikes thats true
Bitmin,That's my thought process exactly
Bitmin,"Yo doc, act like you dont give a fuck then! And when you see her, dont even talk to her. IN FACT GO UP TO HER SLAP THAT BITCH AND TELL HER TO STEP THE FUCK OFF"

Bitmin,@Trapezoider Writing in first person is generally discouraged in academic writing.
Bitmin,This isnt supposed to formal thankfully
Bitmin,Okay

Bitmin,all my college essays have been informal
Bitmin,@The Rona the other kids in my program are bullying me

Bitmin,Did I actually display a good knowledge of evolutionary theory?
Bitmin,I feel like I know nothing

Bitmin,i have a secret project im going to show you tomorrow
Bitmin,
Bitmin,its not your dick is it
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,Alright @Trapezoider  and @Jed story update
Bitmin,I consulted my roommate about his thoughts on the matter
Bitmin,"and he was like if that is a dodge, that is the stupidest excuse of all time"
Bitmin,"So then she might actually be concussed, so to not seem like an ass I say I hope you feel better"
Bitmin,and if you still wanna study just message me
Bitmin,"She responded with ""Aight"""
Bitmin,bruh
Bitmin,it was a dodge
Bitmin,It was totally a dodge
Bitmin,SMH
Bitmin,Yee but like
Bitmin,Aight is a weak ass response
Bitmin,That's like the last excuse I would use
Bitmin,"I dont know dude, this isnt look good. Dont reach out to her for awhile though. When will you see her in person next ?"
Bitmin,idk
Bitmin,There's a chance that I see her on one of the exam days
Bitmin,If we are in the same room
Bitmin,if not will you prolly not sere her again?
Bitmin,She might be in one of the same classes as me next semester
Bitmin,ooh thats guch. I would try to interact as much as possible in person to judge where shes at
Bitmin,"With my response though, the ball is in her park"
Bitmin,So if she is interested at all she would probably message me to study
Bitmin,"If not, she doesn't message me and it's whatever"
Bitmin,I hope she does or else shes a huge dork
Bitmin,I don't really care considering I know next to nothing about her
Bitmin,but is she attractive?
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"But if she's someone who's gonna dodge with an excuse like ""I got a concussion"" I probably don't wanna be with them"
Bitmin,It's like  the boy who cried wolf
Bitmin,White lies in the short term solve nothing
Bitmin,and only cause more pain
Bitmin,Good idea to stay away= from FOLKS LIKE THAT
Bitmin,@everyone
Bitmin,Any math studying tips?
Bitmin,If I do good on this final I have three weeks of bliss
Bitmin,Do practice problems
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,lots and lots of practice problems
Bitmin,that's my basic plan for my stats exam
Bitmin,I get an 8.5/11 sheet for notes
Bitmin,Should I just wright example problems on there too?
Bitmin,Or concepts
Bitmin,"put the formulas on it, and if there are practice exams that seem to have common questions right those down too"
Bitmin,math is for nerds anyways
Bitmin,Thanks sylki
Bitmin,And doctor
Bitmin,no problem
Bitmin,anything to procrastinate even more on my own studying
Bitmin,(that's a bit of an exagerration I've already studied a solid amount today and I feel pretty justified in taking the evening off)
Bitmin,I was gonna study like all day
Bitmin,But then I spent the whole morning finishing my shity paper
Bitmin,Because I literally FORGOT
Bitmin,But doctor is a god and he helped 
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Do your math teachers ever default to weird examples?
Bitmin,Because whenever he talks about any type of regression he always does so in terms of frog populations over time
Bitmin,occasionally
Bitmin,mostly my stats teacher goes off on weird tangents
Bitmin,like the time he somehow ended up discussing how he'd much rather have a goat than a ferrari
Bitmin,why?
Bitmin,Is a goat better than a ferrari?
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,@Master Memers im never playing skyblock with @The Rona ever again

Bitmin,tumor removal may be optimal now to have  the best chance of saving my hearing
Bitmin,if I the tumor hasn't pushed all the fundal fluid out of my ear I have a 77.6% chance of keeping most hearing as compared to 52%
Bitmin,anyways @Rivals of Aether anyone dtp

Bitmin,"I think the standard method of becoming an acolyte in the classical world was to camp outside the master's school or home, persistently return (for months to years) despite being chased away every day, then finally be admitted to a brutal test of your motivations and abilities, which you would probably fail, leading to a beating and an admonishment never to return.

Bitmin,"I am very confused. So someone left a comment on a youtube album saying that the album stopped kids from becoming liberals by warning them about the dangers of the world becoming like the one in the album. But the album is about a world where all freedom of expression is basically banned, which kinda happens on both extreme ends of the political spectrum (either agressive safe spaces and everything censored to avoid offending people or on the other end the shutting down of people being some way that they don't like (like gay), and in general on the extremes of both sides just the shutdown of opposing opinions). Funnier still is that the band is a Canadian one so they're probably fairly left by default -_-"
Bitmin,"on top of which, this album (and a lot of their other stuff) are basically just about how important music is to society, which isn't a political statement in any way"
Bitmin,and I genuinely can't decide if the comment was a bait or not

Bitmin,Google just made a chess engine that totally destroyed the previous best chess engine.
Bitmin,Wait what was the previous chess ai
Bitmin,Was it deep blue?
Bitmin,Or was that the one from 1993
Bitmin,That beat kasperov
Bitmin,"Deep Blue was the first AI to take a match from a world champion (it beat kasparov). It did this in 1997. The current best chess engine (at least it was) is Stockfish. Google's new AI is called AlphaZero and it beat Stockfish in a 100 game match with 28 wins, 72 draws and 0 losses. It even won 3 games with black (which is very rare at engine level). AlphaZero achieved this after only 4 hours of learning and is likely the strongest chess entity to ever play the game."
Bitmin,How much training data did it have?
Bitmin,I love how they name their ai alpha (blank)
Bitmin,Alpha go
Bitmin,The go ai
Bitmin,And now alpha zero
Bitmin,But seriously how much training data have
Bitmin,And what was the capactiy of the agents housing?
Bitmin,Processing power*
Bitmin,@Trapezoider The only knowlege it had was the rules of the game and 4 hours of playing against itself.
Bitmin,No outside data whatsoever.
Bitmin,welp my electric razer ran out of batteries halfway through me shaving with it

Bitmin,the supposedly greatest film of all time
Bitmin,"When a reporter is assigned to decipher newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane's (Orson Welles) dying words, his investigation gradually reveals the fascinating portrait of a complex man who rose from obscurity to staggering heights. Though Kane's friend and colleague Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and his mistress, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), shed fragments of light on Kane's life, the reporter fears he may never penetrate the mystery of the elusive man's final word, ""Rosebud."""

Bitmin,I'm good basically whenever
Bitmin,I'm through with studying for the day
Bitmin,I'm not sure I want to play a rivals tourney
Bitmin,I'm just watching capcom cup atm and I can stop whenever
Bitmin,@Max why not
Bitmin,If I play I'm not going to go tryhard with mains
Bitmin,ok thats fine

Bitmin,I'm probably gonna etalus and ori only
Bitmin,I just don't have the motivation
Bitmin,motivation to play a video game
Bitmin,for fun
Bitmin,with your buds
Bitmin,to play well with wrastor i need to grind for awhile
Bitmin,oh ok
Bitmin,then don't play wrastor
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,that is my main
Bitmin,when I say no main I mean no wrastor
Bitmin,in all fairness you said mains
Bitmin,which means I probably won't play ori
Bitmin,he is also a character that needs practice to play well
Bitmin,i feel like if we do a tourney ill prolly get last
Bitmin,jed might win
Bitmin,if max isnt playing wrastor
Bitmin,nah max still beats me anyways
Bitmin,"I prolly wont be on till kinda late, like 10EST or later, will you guys still be here?"
Bitmin,yee

Bitmin,@Sak von Sak ?
Bitmin,I don't have to go to school tomorrow
Bitmin,I'll be there
Bitmin,I don't have anything tomorrow till like 130
Bitmin,noice
Bitmin,my sleep cycle is totally screwey tho
Bitmin,"couldn't fall asleep till 4am last night, woke up at 730, couldn't fall back asleep till 9, slept till like 1230"
Bitmin,thats me over the summer
Bitmin,damn I barely know street fighter but this is a hype tournament
Bitmin,I'm just gonna cheer for this one japanese dude who plays the only character I vaguely know how to play
Bitmin,I prolly won't be here till 8ish pst

Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,@The Rona

Bitmin,Our man Devon can't watch tonight
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Tomorrow then?
Bitmin,I will be home at like 9 PST
Bitmin,Or we just watch anyways XDEEEEE
Bitmin,also @Homies I read something about a rivals tournament maybe?
Bitmin,"If there is a tourament, it will be late. Although late is relative and since you are PST it might not be that late for you."
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,good god this tournament's hype
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,capcom cup
Bitmin,tis a street fighter tournament
Bitmin,like the biggest non-evo one of the year
Bitmin,LINK
Bitmin,https://www.twitch.tv/capcomfighters
Bitmin,CapcomFighters - Twitch
Bitmin,Capcom Cup Day 2 - Top 32 to Top 8
Bitmin,you just missed a nutty winner's finals
Bitmin,"@Rivals of Aether ill be there in 30, lets start the tourney then"
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,kkk
Bitmin,kkkk
Bitmin,kkkkk
Bitmin,f
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,pay your respects man
Bitmin,street fighter looks so hard
Bitmin,apparently this is the easiest street fighter
Bitmin,they made a ton of stuff more lenient
Bitmin,ah
Bitmin,dude nemo tho
Bitmin,nemo's the guy I'm cheering for
Bitmin,due to having played like 15 minutes of urien once
Bitmin,I've only watched one but same
Bitmin,urien just seems cool
Bitmin,yee let's go nemo
Bitmin,This game looks so boring
Bitmin,huh
Bitmin,I think it looks pretty interesting
Bitmin,"but part of that is I probably have a bit of a better idea of what's going on (not by a ton, but somewhat)"
Bitmin,I've watched a lot of different traditional fighters and this one seems by far the least interesting.
Bitmin,it's not quite as crazy as a lot of them but it's way easier to tell what's going on
Bitmin,"imo my favourite one to watch is p4a, shame it's basically a dead game (they released a really good balance patch... only to the arcade version and so like half the community migrated and the other half couldn't and it killed the game for the most part)"
Bitmin,I'm so happy to have finally made some progress. I clapped so hard my hands now hurt.
Bitmin,(This is minesweeper for those who don't play)
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Bitmin,I'm gonna watch till the end of this set
Bitmin,which might be pretty fast
Bitmin,mmmk
Bitmin,@Trapezoider there is a losers bracket
Bitmin,why
Bitmin,smh
Bitmin,So you can have a second chance
Bitmin,@Homies R I V A L S O F A E T H E R I S A F U C K I N G G A Y A S S G A M E
Bitmin,no u
Bitmin,ur mum gay
Bitmin,no ur mum gay
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Let me know who wins!
Bitmin,ur mum gay
Bitmin,@Max I won 3-2 3-1
Bitmin,Nice
Bitmin,I'm super happy cause it was a great set
Bitmin,but I'm still super salty
Bitmin,same
Bitmin,ugh one game I sd'd at like 5
Bitmin,fucking xxxswagdabkamxxx
Bitmin,and lost a really important game cause of it
Bitmin,@Max come play me
Bitmin,I don't want to
Bitmin,I only played the tourney as a favor I'm not really enjoying ROA right now
Bitmin,melee then?
Bitmin,in about 10 minutes
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,you are boosted mans
Bitmin,I don't understand
Bitmin,I've lost 1 out of 10 ranked games
Bitmin,"@everyone finally finished putting together a rough outline of a tabletop rpg campaign (basically D&D, but not actually D&D), can I have a show of @me for a rough indication of numbers for who'd be interested? I'm either gonna start running it like, tomorrow evening or in the new year, haven't decided yet"
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak I might be game
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak for kameron
Bitmin,hes down
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,can we start tomorrow? @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,probably yeah
Bitmin,sweet!
Bitmin,we got more people than I expected so I'm gonna have to tweak the fight I had planned
Bitmin,"but meh, it's fun to put characters together"
Bitmin,Now I've got to come up with a clever character that isn't just lawful good
Bitmin,tomorrow will probably be like two-ish hours of character creation
Bitmin,so you don't need a ton of premise
Bitmin,TWO HOURS???
Bitmin,yote
Bitmin,character creation takes ages
Bitmin,especially since you guys don't know the system or any of the charms (there are probably upwards of 100) which form the basis of your character
Bitmin,and from what I've found you'll probably get ideas for how you want your character to be as a person as you start putting them together as a bundle of stats and abilities
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak rivals?
Bitmin,naw
Bitmin,hands kinda hurt
Bitmin,com'on
Bitmin,nope
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,thou shalt not tempt me
Bitmin,t h o u s h a l t n o t t e m p t
Bitmin,t h o u g h s h a l t u s e t h e s p a c e b a r
Bitmin,a l o t
Bitmin,How similar is the character creation to D&D?
Bitmin,ish
Bitmin,it's a bit more straightforward imo
Bitmin,there aren't clearly defined classes in the same way
Bitmin,"which is good and bad - good that I don't have to cover how to play different classes for each person who's playing, bad in that you have a ton of options no matter what"
Bitmin,"also there's fewer weird things with equipment and race, and there's no super complex classes where you're choosing religions and the associated weird benefits and stuff"

Bitmin,silver snipers op
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Where can I find a VOD of them?

Bitmin,yuri roughly average girl
Bitmin,@Feral Nebula Need backup
Bitmin,huh?
Bitmin,I'm in for sayori on monika
Bitmin,but honestly it's doki doki literature club the characters aren't that that deep
Bitmin,yuri is bAD
Bitmin,ffs someone play something where there is an actual valid best girl to be had
Bitmin,ddlc doesn't have the character depth to justify this much of a best girl fight
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,do I need the dlc?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,there's dlc?
Bitmin,I'm not arguing for the best. Just that Yuri was the worst by far.
Bitmin,Yeahi ts like 20
Bitmin,no you don't
Bitmin,let people have their opinions tho @ max
Bitmin,yeah you communist]
Bitmin,Yo im bout to get some cupcakes
Bitmin,from the literature club

Bitmin,because it looks cooL?
Bitmin,\
Bitmin,yeah but all of us played it a long time ago
Bitmin,cause he finished daddy dating simulator and needed a new on e:P
Bitmin,I didnt even know this game existed
Bitmin,That was probably during one of my long  frostbite hietus;s
Bitmin,oh right
Bitmin,Someone find an actualy dating sim so that we can actually have best girl arguments
Bitmin,katawa shoujo

Bitmin,its premise is incredibly alienating but it's incredibly good
Bitmin,it might sound cheesy but it literally changed me as a person
Bitmin,the only way you're getting me to play roblox is as a meme
Bitmin,Sylki plays dating sims???
Bitmin,just the one
Bitmin,It's the only way he can get women
Bitmin,wait you don't
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,gotta fill the void some how
Bitmin,and I only started it out of spite so that I could critique people who kept telling me to from a more informed perspective
Bitmin,and then somehow I actually ended up really liking it
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,gg
Bitmin,yeah hes not gay
Bitmin,hes a cool mans
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak dating sims are cool
Bitmin,in general I will disagree
Bitmin,because of how REALISTIC THEY ARE
Bitmin,-_-

Bitmin,oh

Bitmin,no yuri is cool
Bitmin,and skip through the dialogue REAL FAST
Bitmin,nyoom
Bitmin,nyoom
Bitmin,same
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,"so I've been putting together one last character for day one of the campaign, I might not end up using them cause I kinda made them op as fuck"
Bitmin,they kinda got away from my original idea of a graceful grappler kind of a fighter
Bitmin,"she can grab you, do a genuinely unreasonable amount of damage, possibly freeze you for as many turns as she does damage, and then while you're frozen trap you in a bubble that will probably take at least two turns to break through even after you defrost"
Bitmin,what the fuck dude
Bitmin,Thats op
Bitmin,This man is a monster
Bitmin,"oh and she also has a pretty unreasonable amount of health and defense, a few skills that increase her defense even further, and a skill that can force you to ignore a squishy person until you deal with her"
Bitmin,which you're not gonna be able to cause she's tanky as fuck and is just gonna freeze you and trap you in bubbles
Bitmin,yo balance these mans
Bitmin,dont delete her
Bitmin,this lady's getting balanced
Bitmin,just tone down?
Bitmin,"I'm removing the tankiness and the forcing you to deal with her first, reducing her damage"
Bitmin,so now maybe she won't look like this
Bitmin,OH MY GOD
Bitmin,WHO IS THESE MANS
Bitmin,What is the setting for this campaign?
Bitmin,modern fantasy
Bitmin,im hyped
Bitmin,So I can be a school girl?
Bitmin,im actually hyped as fuck
Bitmin,can I be a columbine shooter?
Bitmin,:-:
Bitmin,probably not
Bitmin,k
Bitmin,also yes you can 100% be a schoolgirl
Bitmin,Sweet
Bitmin,k if theres a sschool girl
Bitmin,I might be a schoolgirl
Bitmin,when I played this I played a schoolgirl
Bitmin,there needs to be a school shooter
Bitmin,smh
Bitmin,we also had a hairy motherfucker in his midthirties who was kind of a pedo
Bitmin,it was hilarious
Bitmin,can I be a generic terrorist?
Bitmin,not really
Bitmin,uGHHH
Bitmin,you're kinda prevented from being all that evil by the premise of the game
Bitmin,you can only be a little evil
Bitmin,Can I be a terrorist whos suicide vest didnt detonate so now he just screams allah ackbar at everyone he meets?
Bitmin,please no
Bitmin,"although you could, with a bit of work, plausibly be a reusable suicide bomber"
Bitmin,it just wouldn't be practical
Bitmin,y e s
Bitmin,p l e a s e
Bitmin,Actually ima be a kekistan memer who lives in his moms basement
Bitmin,it's far easier to throw explosives or set traps than attach them to yourself
Bitmin,I do not condone this
Bitmin,cause you'd need at least one or two charms to make sure you don't die every time you blow yourself up
Bitmin,also you need to get the explosives from somewhere
Bitmin,yo this sounds complicated as fuck
Bitmin,yeah no shit being a reusable suicide bomber is complicated
Bitmin,
Bitmin,please let me do it
Bitmin,Trap
Bitmin,please
Bitmin,Please fucking let me be  a reusable suicide bomber
Bitmin,no\
Bitmin,T H I S I S M Y C A L L I N G N I B B A
Bitmin,sigh
Bitmin,"basic plan at this point is character creation -> test fight with a team I've put together -> tweaking your characters, so you can give it a shot"
Bitmin,y e s
Bitmin,TTHANK YOU
Bitmin,Thank you dungeon master
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"basic rule #1 of DMing: if it sounds dumb, and your player wants to try it, let them try. If it crashes and burns, you warned them. If it works, then it's fun."
Bitmin,My friend tried for like 10 minutes to tame a wolf in some cave
Bitmin,My other friend ended up killing in on purpose
Bitmin,yo sylki
Bitmin,Gotta be honest
Bitmin,never played dnd
Bitmin,Parents thought it was satanic 
Bitmin,lololol
Bitmin,"What, how?"
Bitmin,so this is gonna be me being fucking autisic and doing dumb shit
Bitmin,while everyone wrecks
Bitmin,I mean you can basically worship satan in traditional d&d
Bitmin,yee
Bitmin,I mean
Bitmin,my parents are super religious
Bitmin,you can
Bitmin,I wasnt allowed to play pokemon
Bitmin,because they thought it was satanic
Bitmin,my childhood was fucked
Bitmin,
Bitmin,woah woah you're parents are those people??
Bitmin,That's a feelsbad
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,thats why crazy shit happens sometimes round here
Bitmin,"on an unrelated note, holy shit I just realized it's technically possible to have a character who, out-of-the-box after character creation, can summon and control thunderstorms"
Bitmin,@mycomputerbeingthrowninagarbagecaninasnowstorm
Bitmin,Dibs
Bitmin,dibs
Bitmin,they can't do... anything else
Bitmin,I already called it
Bitmin,bids
Bitmin,I'm gonna be a little school girl who controls the weather
Bitmin,i call shotgun
Bitmin,btw you can just... get that a little later
Bitmin,
Bitmin,it's not even all that good early game because your activation stats will be meh
Bitmin,yo do we get mounts?
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,do we get M O U N T S to increase movement?
Bitmin,Like could I theoretically ride a goat into battle
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,FUCK YES
Bitmin,there's even a fighting style for mounted combat
Bitmin,I AM THE REUSABLE GOAT RIDING TERRORIST
Bitmin,your goat would die every time you detonated tho
Bitmin,how expensive are goats?
Bitmin,fucked if I know
Bitmin,I haven't looked into it
Bitmin,canI just keep buying more goats?
Bitmin,theoretically
Bitmin,CaN i have a swarm of goats follow me into battle?
Bitmin,like the zerg
Bitmin,but goats
Bitmin,I don't think they'd attack for you
Bitmin,I'd have to skim the rules and charms
Bitmin,Damn
Bitmin,see if there is a possess charm
Bitmin,so I could possess all the goats
Bitmin,but I'm probably gonna say no just cause that'd make combat a bitch
Bitmin,and the goats would all have to have their own turns
Bitmin,holy shit yeah
Bitmin,and it'd take forever
Bitmin,wouldnt we have to roll for every goat
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,not fun for the everyone else tho
Bitmin,OH MY GOD
Bitmin,"Sylki, I didnt realize how hype this game could be"
Bitmin,holy shit bois
Bitmin,"ok so there is in fact a charm called ""Tame the Savage Beast"" which lets you give animals commands"
Bitmin,it has an upgrade
Bitmin,oh god
Bitmin,swarming: can give orders to a whole swarm of creatures
Bitmin,although they have to be small
Bitmin,FUCK YESS
Bitmin,ie not goats
Bitmin,GOATS ARE SMALL
Bitmin,GOATS ARE SO SMALL
Bitmin,"this is like, small birds/insects/mice small"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,look how small these mans are
Bitmin,@Max brb replacing one of my existing characters with a recreation of Skitter
Bitmin,
Bitmin,these mans are so small
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,you can command a single goat
Bitmin,okay mans
Bitmin,Wait sylki
Bitmin,...
Bitmin,Is there a charm to miniaturize things?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,oh dear
Bitmin,lemme look
Bitmin,technically yes
Bitmin,applying it to goats would be unreasonably expensive
Bitmin,Don't feed him Sylki
Bitmin,he couldn't get all the bits necessary till late game
Bitmin,so I don't mind this one
Bitmin,"Can I be a really old wise wizard who, instead of dying, opted to transfer his soul into robot/new body (a kid)."
Bitmin,Sylki
Bitmin,I will make this dream happen
Bitmin,My imagination has been empowered
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,nope
Bitmin,rip the dream
Bitmin,you could be a wise old wizard who did die and was reborn and remembers his past life
Bitmin,omg
Bitmin,although it's kinda hard to wizard in this game
Bitmin,the traditional wizard-style stuff isn't super practical
Bitmin,I might add the remembers past life to a different class
Bitmin,I USED TO BE A KING
Bitmin,and stuff like that could be fun
Bitmin,I can't wait to see how your king interacts with trap's lunatic miniature goat herder
Bitmin,yes this will be interesting
Bitmin,And my Schoolgirl
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Who may or may not be controlling the weather
Bitmin,The king demands it stops raining
Bitmin,rains more
Bitmin,struck by lighting
Bitmin,"just a recommendation, don't build for storms out of the gate, build for storms a few level-ups later"
Bitmin,cause if you build for immediate storms your character sucks at first
Bitmin,
Bitmin,aight buff grappler is no longer op (or buff)
Bitmin,"still has that hilarious grapple -> freeze combo, but I removed the additional bubble thing, reduced her damage, health, and defense"
Bitmin,"op buff grappler might come back at some point tho, it's too good an idea to pass up"
Bitmin,Suddenly a swarm of goats ascends into the air and generates a whirlwind which dispells the storm
Bitmin,ok you can't have flying goats
Bitmin,I'm pretty sure that one's impossible
Bitmin,C H E C K THE RULES
Bitmin,See if there is a levitation charm
Bitmin,yes but it only applies to you
Bitmin,you can't levitate other people
Bitmin,
Bitmin,wait shit you can
Bitmin,Thats actually a bummer
Bitmin,but you have to also be flying
Bitmin,OKAY
Bitmin,SO MY MAN
Bitmin,Dang
Bitmin,YOU ARE TELLING ME
Bitmin,I need this
Bitmin,I'll be like storm
Bitmin,I CAN LEVITATE WITH A SWARM OF MINITUARIZED GOATS
Bitmin,"technically, yes"
Bitmin,technically I am about to nutt
Bitmin,you will be basically useless in all other situations tho
Bitmin,oh shit im prolly gonna die
Bitmin,If I dont levelup my characters normal abilities
Bitmin,smh
Bitmin,"cause the charms you need for the levitating, the size changing, and the size changing applied to goats are all really expensive"
Bitmin,like lots of experience to get to them
Bitmin,and lots of mana-equivilant to use them
Bitmin,damn
Bitmin,how long will this run take?
Bitmin,for us to complete as a group
Bitmin,I have no idea
Bitmin,Whats the longest run you have done?
Bitmin,once a week for like 8 months
Bitmin,Are you willing to DM this all the way through if it takes a million years
Bitmin,but I've never DM'd
Bitmin,and I don't know how long my planned plot will last
Bitmin,Im so hyped bois
Bitmin,my advice is roll with a smaller goat-related goal
Bitmin,if he gets goats I want wolves
Bitmin,no fuck you
Bitmin,wOW
Bitmin,offended
Bitmin,goats > everything else
Bitmin,WOLVES

Bitmin,Then you just wait for his gust of wind
Bitmin,He never fucking comes to the trench
Bitmin,And paraglide around him till his horns turn blue

Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,Bad characters are just not as fun.
Bitmin,So I was being a meme and I renamed my gamemaker file from game_maker to gay_maker and it broke the program

Bitmin,Is that online or in person
Bitmin,Also @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,Online
Bitmin,Can you talk for a few minutes?
Bitmin,There aren't really any locals
Bitmin,I didn't think their would be
Bitmin,"Cool piece of data from an old stats exam I'm doing (this is an actual cited study, ie true data): Researchers tested a sample of women shortly after they had given birth in a large urban hospital. Each mother, blindfolded to prevent sight or smell, felt the hands of her own infant plus two others of the same sex. Of the 68 mothers with at least an hour exposure to their newborns, 47 correctly identified their own baby."
Bitmin,What the fu
Bitmin,That is incredible
Bitmin,"the actual question wanted us to figure out exactly how unlikely that is to occur by chance, and the result was the most extremely unlikely result I've seen in this entire course"
Bitmin,even taking into account the relatively small sample size
Bitmin,"the exact percentage value isn't even included in the chart we get for calculating exact percents cause it's so unlikely that every point is basically the same, but the actual value ends up being less than 0.000000001% that that result was a fluke"
Bitmin,"basically, if it is actually pure guesswork and only 1/3 of the time they should have guessed right, there's a less than 0.00000001% chance that the study would produce those results or results more extreme than that"
Bitmin,That's mental
Bitmin,Yo is it homosexual to be a mother?
Bitmin,"No, it is incest though"
Bitmin,Like

Bitmin,"@Melee This combo video has a lot of sentimental value to me as it was one I really enjoyed during my early days of melee.

Bitmin,cool
Bitmin,don't spend it all in one place
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,im leaving my rig mining every day
Bitmin,and its free because I dont pay electricity
Bitmin,so $4 a day
Bitmin,not bad over a year
Bitmin,spread your marvelous bounty across multiple vending machines
Bitmin,Yo just gonna save the btc I get
Bitmin,so youre basically stealing from your parents
Bitmin,lololol
Bitmin,are you fucking retarded
Bitmin,You steal by existing
Bitmin,I wonder what the actual electricity breakdown is tho
Bitmin,All of us did
Bitmin,no its charity
Bitmin,but there's no way he's drawing enough that it's noticeable
Bitmin,then they are being gracious enough
Bitmin,to pay my electricity bill
Bitmin,well If I was paying it
Bitmin,It would be enough to make my profits negligible
Bitmin,also the current btc directory is 150 gb
Bitmin,smh
Bitmin,the blockchain is so huge
Bitmin,does it really take that much energy to make bitcoins?
Bitmin,yeah you are basically running your gpu on max all day
Bitmin,huh
Bitmin,do you know what a gpu is?
Bitmin,it's the graphics card
Bitmin,its a graphics processing unit
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,essentially
Bitmin,the calculations needed to generate bits on the blockchain
Bitmin,are very similar to graphics processing
Bitmin,so gpu's work best for btc mining
Bitmin,and running a modern gpu on full power
Bitmin,all day

Bitmin,?>
Bitmin,how was ur exam
Bitmin,my dude
Bitmin,good
Bitmin,One question that I didn't know how to do though
Bitmin,there was a question that i had no fucking clue what the answer was on my programming midterm so i just guessed and got full marks
Bitmin,like is was the second most heavily weighted question
Bitmin,"""what are the 5 steps of pre planning"""
Bitmin,"and i was like i think nityan has said something about DDIT (Design, Develop, Implement, Trace)"
Bitmin,but thats only 4
Bitmin,fuck just add F to the end and say final test
Bitmin,and apparently that was right
Bitmin,so I guess an earthquake just happened where I'm at?
Bitmin,Are you dead?
Bitmin,I wish
Bitmin,I didn't even feel it tbh
Bitmin,oh prolly cause it wasn't in my city
Bitmin,are you suicidal
Bitmin,Why would you WANT an earthquake????
Bitmin,cause that'd be awesome
Bitmin,Dude death by earthquake would be epic
Bitmin,I didnt feel it either
Bitmin,I think these fags are lying
Bitmin,also @Feral Nebula
Bitmin,its almost T I M E
Bitmin,i s  i t
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,It was centralized in mollala so that's why it was weak if that here
Bitmin,well we better get used to it
Bitmin,were going to be south of the bay area in two years
Bitmin,Lots of earthquaks my dude
Bitmin,also my phone is almost as big as my switch
Bitmin,smh
Bitmin,Oi lmoi
Bitmin,boi
Bitmin,I was playing this cocky ass clairen who taunted after every kill
Bitmin,and he taunted before I died last stock game 2 and I killed him for it
Bitmin,and then took game 3 as well
Bitmin,so satisfying
Bitmin,@Jed Which character were you playing?
Bitmin,ranno
Bitmin,GG
Bitmin,destroy all Clairen players
Bitmin,but you played Clairen in tourney...
Bitmin,that was because sylki revealed what I was actually playing
Bitmin,but still
Bitmin,you used what you despise
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,hes right
Bitmin,you refuse to teach me clairen
Bitmin,because you dont want anyone playing clairen
Bitmin,then you play him in tourney
Bitmin,Why do you think I took the character choice path I did in melee
Bitmin,the logic here actually makes sense
Bitmin,I picked the character that beat my previous character the hardest until I got to fox
Bitmin,Marth to Shiek to Puff to Fox
Bitmin,if you hate op characters
Bitmin,why the fuck do you play fox lmao
Bitmin,Fox is not OP
Bitmin,he has weaknesses
Bitmin,so does clairen
Bitmin,He wouldnt be beatable if he didnt
Bitmin,not in the same sense
Bitmin,I DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING
Bitmin,AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED ANYTHING
Bitmin,DON'T PIN THIS ON ME
Bitmin,to beat clairen you just have to play better
Bitmin,also kameron wrecked your Clairen thus not OP
Bitmin,To beat fox you have to play better
Bitmin,Clairen has not real exploitable weakness
Bitmin,thats literally how rivals goes
Bitmin,lmao
Bitmin,you must play better
Bitmin,Clearly false if kam can beat you?
Bitmin,"poor you, you have to play better to beat someone"
Bitmin,my Clairen has under 2 hours total play time
Bitmin,boo hoo
Bitmin,By play better I mean play better + extra
Bitmin,so you can play better than them and still lose if it isn't by enough
Bitmin,Also the fox matchup...
Bitmin,lmao
Bitmin,Falco Marth and Samus all go even with fox
Bitmin,no one goes even with clairen
Bitmin,How can that be true lmao
Bitmin,which part?
Bitmin,No one goes even with clairen
Bitmin,From my experience either her range or her down b make her beat every character
Bitmin,Then get gud
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,or play a better game
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,you gonna take that shit?
Bitmin,I think max complains too much about a character that I've heard commentary from good players
Bitmin,Real talk I still almost always beat Clairen on ladder and against Jed. I just think the character is stupid.
Bitmin,so get gud does not really apply
Bitmin,I'm already good I just don't have fun when playing against her
Bitmin,games are meant to be fun
Bitmin,"I dont have fun playing against fox. Does that mean fox is bad, and we should all complain against fox?"
Bitmin,so it isn't a matter of OP just a matter of not liking the matchup
Bitmin,Are you gonna quit melee because you hate the falco matchup?
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,cause I don't like playing against Zetters
Bitmin,You grind the matchup
Bitmin,DO YOU THINK I ENJOY SAMUS PUFF
Bitmin,and get good
Bitmin,it does apply
Bitmin,DO YOU
Bitmin,Why would you play melee if you you hate the matchup that you will be playing more than any other @Trapezoider ?
Bitmin,Because I like conquering the thing I despise with all my heart
Bitmin,that was really only right after the dlc dropped
Bitmin,Its why I play the game
Bitmin,Its also why I go through cycles of not
Bitmin,playing
Bitmin,Because I get frustrated and do rage quit the game because of dumb matchups I suck at
Bitmin,But
Bitmin,I kEEP  COMING BACK
Bitmin,but you still enjoy conquering the hard matchup
Bitmin,I don't
Bitmin,Because the eternal alure of the mountains I have to climb is more addicting than most thrills in life
Bitmin,hence why I never play bad characters in anything
Bitmin,The only thing Im pointing out why its dumb for you to complain about a strong character
Bitmin,Because you are the guy who defaults to strong OP characters
Bitmin,
Bitmin,strong does not equal over powered
Bitmin,Semantics
Bitmin,naw actually that's valid
Bitmin,but still
Bitmin,I think you're overreacting to clairen
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,If I liked her I would play her
Bitmin,I've been annoyed about it for a while just never said anything
Bitmin,you did play her...
Bitmin,for a day
Bitmin,In tournament
Bitmin,ONE MATCH FOR THE MEME
Bitmin,that is not evidence
Bitmin,that was not for the meme
Bitmin,"Why am I getting attacked over hating a character??? If Sylki randomly decided to post ""I hate falco"" I garuntee this wouldn't happen. Let me have an opinion."
Bitmin,you were mad that I said you weren't playing clairen
Bitmin,which you thought told kameron who you were playing
Bitmin,so you played clairen
Bitmin,I do hate falco
Bitmin,but I sucked it up
Bitmin,and I'm now pretty good against falco
Bitmin,honestly I think that Rivals is a fairly balanced game and its moreso playing the opponent than whatever character they choose
Bitmin,same with sheik
Bitmin,I sucked it up and I'm alright at the matchup now
Bitmin,now you are a G 0 D
Bitmin,its all about the grind matchup isn't important
Bitmin,so my brother works at uber
Bitmin,and apparently he takes an uber to work every day
Bitmin,"and frequently has a conversation that basically goes:
uber driver: so, where do you work?
my brother: oh, I work at uber.
uber driver: neat, how long have you been driving for them?
my brother (presumably insufferably smug): hahahaha no I'm an engineer at uber."
Bitmin,Does he get free Uber credits tho
Bitmin,yeah he gets like $200 free uber a month
Bitmin,
Bitmin,yo that man is straight up about to revolutionize the way we transport
Bitmin,Uber published a 95 white paper on electric VTOLS
Bitmin,I read the whole thing
Bitmin,Im hooked
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,is he working on that?
Bitmin,nope
Bitmin,he's doing some thing for people to sign up
Bitmin,the unglamourous life of a week one employee
Bitmin,Oh!
Bitmin,He just startedf
Bitmin,yeah like literally last week
Bitmin,Do you plan on having a silicon valley programming job?
Bitmin,no idea
Bitmin,my guy
Bitmin,be a programmer in LA
Bitmin,Join the domicillium
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Lmao ran into a guy who's steam name is faggotsplayclairen
Bitmin,First semester of college DONE!
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Well there goes net neutrality
Bitmin,Did they fucking pass the repeal
Bitmin,Yep
Bitmin,Fuck
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,What's your source?
Bitmin,@Eric Working From Home
Bitmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/?st=JB6ST1U8&sh=fe1bb2f9
Bitmin,"The FCC’s vote was predictably frustrating, but we’re not done fighting for net neutrality. • r/announcements"
Bitmin,"Following today’s disappointing vote from the FCC, Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this..."
Bitmin,It hasn't actually through yet tho
Bitmin,Cause of the bomb threat
Bitmin,HELL YEAH
Bitmin,THAT WAS ME NIBBAS
Bitmin,Lmao
Bitmin,KING RAJAH YOUR RESIDENT TERRORIST HERE TO SAVE THE DAY
Bitmin,Ajit Pai? More like Ajit POOP AMIRITE
Bitmin,XDEeeeeee
Bitmin,Also fuck America
Bitmin,Jed Canada is an option right?
Bitmin,yeah I think we still get net neutrality lol
Bitmin,finally a widely acceptable way that canada > us
Bitmin,The vote went 3-2
Bitmin,It passed
Bitmin,Canada here I come 
Bitmin,"Better health care, net neutrality"
Bitmin,"there's a lot of things I like about canada over the us, they're just not things that are universally appreciated (like free health care, gun control, adding 'u' to the spelling of words that don't strictly need it but imo it looks better, a more logical election system, better skiing, not being a terrorist target, etc.)"
Bitmin,Better skiing 
Bitmin,it's true
Bitmin,mostly just cause we've got more area that has good skiing weather so statistically we get more good mountains for skiing
Bitmin,you guys get a bit of the rockies and that's about it
Bitmin,"okay Google, how do I get Canadian citizenship"
Bitmin,honestly you can kinda just show up and ask nicely
Bitmin,if you live here and have a job at least
Bitmin,So not an extremely long difficult process like the us?
Bitmin,"we have a system that basically ranks you based on how much we think you'll benefit our society which takes a bit to get through (especially if you get ranked low), but honestly upper middle class white people showing up and getting a job on visa is pretty much a guaruntee that you'll get citezenship"
Bitmin,it's not instant but it's faster than the states
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"one thing that was kinda funny is that the states introduced a plan kinda like that, where people get ranked based on desireability and some canadians were acting all offended and like 'wow that's not a nice way to decide citezenship, canada's above shit like that'"
Bitmin,@The Rona Going to see Star Wars tonight 
Bitmin,noice
Bitmin,it's supposed to be reaaaally good
Bitmin,wait who has seen it?
Bitmin,my showing is the first
Bitmin,prescreenings exist
Bitmin,especially for reviewers so that they can have people say it's good to get more people to come watch on opening night
Bitmin,I normally don't trust mass opinion of whats good. I'm just hoping it isn't a copy paste of Empire Strikes Back like the last one was a copy of A New Hope.
Bitmin,It probably will be
Bitmin,"Or they will do something cool 
Like switching Rey and kylo rens place"
Bitmin,Also fuck America

Bitmin,so

Bitmin,Good meme
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Lmao
Bitmin,Did she think it was funny
Bitmin,She was really confused
Bitmin,I think she thought I was hitting on her
Bitmin,Which I WAS NOT
Bitmin,4/10
Bitmin,"evidently, you dun goofed"
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,Sylki are you interested in AI?
Bitmin,Because big development
Bitmin,Google just invented a new deep learning ai
Bitmin,Which beat another Google ai (alpha go- ie the best go player in the world) in 100 out of 100 games
Bitmin,So they just improved the best ai by 100 fold
Bitmin,Ai developments are so non linear
Bitmin,It's incredible
Bitmin,fuck yeah Canada #1 country
Bitmin,@Trapezoider @Sak von Sak Its possible my controller is broken but I'm going to need to test it some more before I am sure of it.
Bitmin,I would really love for Rey and Kylo to switch places
Bitmin,clairens energy shield is 10 sec now

Bitmin,"also, what has my life come to"
Bitmin,it's 6pm
Bitmin,I haven't eaten
Bitmin,anything
Bitmin,all day
Bitmin,nothing like stress to surgically remove appetite
Bitmin,clearly the solution is to order like $20 of pho and pho accessories
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,"it may be -22 out but hey, pho is only like a block away so I'll live"
Bitmin,"I was gonna have pho today, but the thing is closed until january"
Bitmin,Like
Bitmin,What?
Bitmin,why dont you go pho cough
Bitmin,well it's come to this
Bitmin,exam is tomorrow

Bitmin,we're good over here
Bitmin,"USA: 0

Bitmin,

Bitmin,@The Rona good luck on exams mate
Bitmin,Also canada is weird as heck yo
Bitmin,"it's honestly a fairly good system, we let you in based on how much you're likely to contribute to our country"
Bitmin,although it can shaft you if you're not in a position to get a decent job (ie how doctor's presumably old & retired great aunt couldn't get in)

Bitmin,I don't think so
Bitmin,I was giving it to them because my mom was concerned that I would be tempted by it while they were gone
Bitmin,cause I'm tryna sell it

Bitmin,nah
Bitmin,I don't have anymore juice

Bitmin,ay wrenchd is playing in the rcs tourney today
Bitmin,I agree
Bitmin,bruh what if you looked through a 1 way mirror and on the otherside was a mirror
Bitmin,cause wouldn't it just reflect nothing?
Bitmin,or reflect a reflection of a reflection
Bitmin,it'd be just like two mirrors reflecting each other
Bitmin,just without you being in it
Bitmin,but like
Bitmin,what does a mirror look like
Bitmin,it reflects light
Bitmin,whatever light is present will be reflected back and forth between the mirrors
Bitmin,literally all mirrors are one-way mirrors with a solid thing stuck to the back
Bitmin,"the reason one-way mirrors work is cause one side is way darker than the other, and on the light side enough light is being reflected that you can't see the stuff on the other side"
Bitmin,I highkey wanna buy a one way mirror now
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,Ok
Bitmin,The Last Jedi was really fucking good
Bitmin,like a room like this
Bitmin,
Bitmin,but with an external light source
Bitmin,so you don't see all the lights reflecting
Bitmin,problem with external light is that then you'll just see the outside
Bitmin,that only works because the light is on the inside
Bitmin,ah
Bitmin,I see the error now
Bitmin,Who the heck is using the Frostbite gamers Twitter account?

Bitmin,v115's surprisingly good at melee
Bitmin,kinda not surprising
Bitmin,but he's a brawl/sm4sh guy
Bitmin,admittadly he's like top 5 brawl players at this point
Bitmin,so he's obviously good
Bitmin,but he's got a lot of good falco stuff
Bitmin,https://gfycat.com/WhichContentFluke
Bitmin,w****n
Bitmin,if you say you're good at video games and you're not this man you're just a fucking poser
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Want to join me for TF2?
Bitmin,internet's still a mess (hopefully will be better by tonight) and I'm trying to knock off some job applications
Bitmin,so I'm gonna have to pass atm
Bitmin,Having technical difficulties
Bitmin,when this guy on your team is just feeding so hard but you cant report him for being bad at hte game but then he says niggers in all chat
Bitmin,Yo I played doki doki cause I have my computer at my grandparents house w no internet
Bitmin,And I started playing at 11 pm
Bitmin,That was a mistake
Bitmin,How far did you get?
Bitmin,I finished it
Bitmin,Then I need to send you something
Bitmin,Ok
Bitmin,I see I'm not the only one to have made the late night doki doki mistake
Bitmin,I was about to go to bed too cause I was like oh I should stop I'll just wait for the next day

Bitmin,Wtf
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,Doki doki is spooky as heck
Bitmin,doki doki is okey dokey
Bitmin,welp the application for this internship requires that I state my ethnicity
Bitmin,"in other words, they have a quota of ethnic diversity to meet"
Bitmin,"in other other words, time to get screwed for being white"
Bitmin,yo non-whites check your privilege
Bitmin,So what was that about white privilege again?
Bitmin,lol

Bitmin,THEN WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME IF IT WON'T AFFECT MY LIKELIHOOD BEING HIRED
Bitmin,"Because equality only applies to those who are not white straight males obviously, because we already have the whole of the white supremacist patriarchy on our side."
Bitmin,Things like this might be why the number of liberals decreases as age increases.
Bitmin,maybe
Bitmin,I think it's mostly just society moving left over time so the younger generations will be more left just by virtue of being born in a lefter time
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,iI dont have it installed or I would

Bitmin,Man's got 3 plates
Bitmin,it's all you can eat
Bitmin,Damn
Bitmin,food quality isn't super high tho
Bitmin,I mean with all you can eat it's quantity over quality right 
Bitmin,you learn after the first month or so that all-you-can-eat doesn't mean you should try to eat all of it
Bitmin,AYCE for most meals loses its novelty after awhile
Bitmin,that said I kinda miss it

Bitmin,What class should I play for my Iron Man Challenge (WoW)
Bitmin,Vote Now! [Hunter] [Priest] [Mage] [Shaman] [Warrior] [Paladin] [Warlock] [Rogue] [Druid] [Monk]
Bitmin,@Homies Looks like Nier Automata isn't part of the holiday sale.
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,should I buy skullgirls?
Bitmin,its 2 dollars
Bitmin,Its worth $2
Bitmin,Just know its very different from smash games
Bitmin,kk'
Bitmin,it's pretty good
Bitmin,but on the flip side neither me nor max is really playing it anymore
Bitmin,max just kinda isn't and I'm mostly playing blazblue and guilty gear
Bitmin,more things go on sale as the time passes
Bitmin,but it's good for if you're not sure if you'd like traditional 2D fighters and want to give it a shot
Bitmin,If you buy the game I'll pick it back up and learn a new character
Bitmin,My old main was garbage as a solo
Bitmin,eh yeah if you buy it and max picks it up again I will too
Bitmin,but if you main peacock I'm disowning you
Bitmin,any character where explaining how to get around their basic zoning takes more than six minutes is a character whose shit I refuse to put up with
Bitmin,"oh also you might be amused by this game just cause, at least until he picks a new main, my best character is more or less the best in the game and max chose one of the worst -_-"
Bitmin,*unknowingly
Bitmin,same on my end
Bitmin,"I just saw the guy who taught me playing them and went ""hot damn that looks sick"""
Bitmin,and my other character I mostly started playing cause they have a skin that makes them look just like my favourite character from persona 3
Bitmin,I picked my character because she has the least suggestive outfit
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,"I still think it's pretty funny that of the two clone characters, one of whom is meh and the other is top tier you chose the lower tier one"
Bitmin,is skull girls sketch bois
Bitmin,define sketch?
Bitmin,FAN SERVICE
Bitmin,I mean yes
Bitmin,but they mix things up with it so that it's not pure fanservice
Bitmin,"like the character who's basically a bunch of limbs stitched together and can stretch those limbs out on individual tendons, throw her head at you, and wrap you in a ball of intenstines"
Bitmin,or the character who is literally just made out of blood
Bitmin,what the FUCK
Bitmin,or the unholy monstrosity that is my best character
Bitmin,thats fucking nasty
Bitmin,who is a shapeshifting undulating flesh blob
Bitmin,but there's plenty of characters with basically no fanservice
Bitmin,like big band
Bitmin,who is basically a ton of brass instruments in a trench coat
Bitmin,and with two on screen this is a thing that can happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qcjCnkbROY
Bitmin,skullgirls BigbandのTrumpetで東方U.N.オーエンは彼女なのか？を演奏
Bitmin,Toolを使ったAuto playです TASのようなものです ・Skullgirls is Fighting game:http://skullgirls.com/ ・東方(Touhou) is shooting game ：http://youtu.be/LyLsLCPZWUs Touhou wikipedi...
Bitmin,Is this a TAS?
Bitmin,yeah I think so
Bitmin,still great tho
Bitmin,and his lv5 super you have a little space to just jam out on the trumpet while time is stopped and if you end on the right four notes it activates
Bitmin,"brief history of why this is hilarious before I post the clip, in team fighting games, if you catch an assist and point character at the same time, it's known as a Happy Birthday"
Bitmin,"taken to its logical conclusion, https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyDepressedSpiderPeteZaroll"
Bitmin,KPBLive Playing Skullgirls - Twitch Clips
Bitmin,Happy Birthday - Clipped by MegaMissingn0
Bitmin,That is amazing
Bitmin,but in general it's not too hard to make teams where none of your characters are particularly fanservice-y
Bitmin,my current team is these two:
Bitmin,
Bitmin,and I'm probably gonna add either you
Bitmin,or you
Bitmin,"on the flip side you could always run eliza, valentine, and cerebella:"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,but if you do that max's head might explode
Bitmin,I would also refuse to play against you except late at night
Bitmin,just you wait till I get you to play street fighter 5 and then pick up r mika
Bitmin,like seriously who thought this was reasonable
Bitmin,I've played street fighter and I thought it was super boring
Bitmin,it's mostly neutral
Bitmin,whereas sg is mostly punish
Bitmin,and I mostly just wanted to show that skullgirls isn't actually all that bad in terms of fanservice in fighting games
Bitmin,but I don't think I could bring myself to play someone whose design is that much shameless fanservice
Bitmin,I think the upshot of this whole discussion is you should all drop like $30 on guilty gear so we can learn together and I can fight you with a reasonably dressed girl who can summon motherfucking dolphins
Bitmin,I've seen that character
Bitmin,She looks pretty fun
Bitmin,"on top of which, playstyle-wise she's pretty much what I look for in a character - good zoning, but when you get in you can go ham"
Bitmin,"There is a chance I do buy it, but before I do, I want to have a conversation about the game."
Bitmin,I've only played like an hour
Bitmin,and only in tutorial and training mode
Bitmin,so I dunno if I can give a serious recommendation yet
Bitmin,i played the game for a bit i wasnt a fan adn refunded it
Bitmin,combos felt clunky
Bitmin,and hte punish game seems weak
Bitmin,every move is safe on block from what i could tell
Bitmin,from what I've heard the execution is reallllly tight
Bitmin,no idea about the safe on block bit
Bitmin,from watching it seems like there are definately safe block strings but they're not infinite
Bitmin,and this is a personal thing thid doesnt make the game bad but i prefer button block to directional block
Bitmin,i think i recall skullgirls had directional
Bitmin,but dont quote me
Bitmin,yeah it does
Bitmin,don't like... all fighting games?
Bitmin,at least all the ones I've played do
Bitmin,blazblue's got a weird mix
Bitmin,well i mostly play mortal kombat
Bitmin,i mean i still like fighting games that also have directional block like MvC
Bitmin,MvC is a crazy looking game
Bitmin,its a fucking nutty game
Bitmin,"never played it, but it feels a bit too much like two-touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, you win"
Bitmin,its more like
Bitmin,low sweep to uppercut knockup to 100-0 air juggle
Bitmin,i mostly just like the characters
Bitmin,love capcom and marvel so
Bitmin,combo of hte two always nice
Bitmin,my friend  plays the shit outta street fighter and i cant do shit agianst him
Bitmin,he mains ryu and im like hey man could you just play someone different so i dont get 100-0'd and he says yeah then swaps to ken
Bitmin,like thanks man he has the exact same moveset
Bitmin,lololol
Bitmin,apparently they're pretty different in sfv at least
Bitmin,but not... any other game really
Bitmin,ay apparently pubg is officially out of early access and they optimized a ton of stuff
Bitmin,yeah it is
Bitmin,it looks super good
Bitmin,its fun
Bitmin,I played so much last night
Bitmin,might take a stab at it again and see if my computer can handle it
Bitmin,@Trapezoider @Jed you man's are living together?
Bitmin,nah
Bitmin,I'm just at his house for 2 days
Bitmin,he's at work rn XD

Bitmin,@Sak von Sak rivals in a bit?

Bitmin,My parents said I can go to a melee major
Bitmin,Which one should I attend ?
Bitmin,if you can get anything probably evo
Bitmin,or big house
Bitmin,I would do big house over evo honestly.
Bitmin,but evo is closer to you
Bitmin,but its also vegas
Bitmin,which is probably more expensive
Bitmin,and my parents probably wont let me go to vegas alone
Bitmin,but big house is in maine right?
Bitmin,it's in michigan
Bitmin,or you could come to goml 
Bitmin,where is that?
Bitmin,canada?
Bitmin,

Bitmin,I just wanna go to one major before this game dies
Bitmin,"I make no promises for doubles, but it's on the outskirts of toronto"

Bitmin,and we should stop being racist
Bitmin,It is an issue
Bitmin,It's not about racism
Bitmin,It's about being able to communicate with the god damned people on my server

Bitmin,I can't have a fair shot against him on a fire fight

Bitmin,What?
Bitmin,Psychology's weird man
Bitmin,"Apparently, in an office setting, if you cut in front of someone who's in line to use a photocopier, and give the reason that you're in a rush, 94% of the time they'll let you. If you just ask to use the machine, only 60%. But, if you ask to use the machine, specifically to do some photocopying (ie, something that sounds like a reason but is actually just a redundant statement of what you do with a photocopier) the percentage of people who'll let you cut ahead jumps back up to 93%, only 1% less than if you give a valid reason"
Bitmin,if someone told me they were gonna use the photo copier to make spaghetti hell yeah im gonna let them go ahead of me i wanna see where hes going with this
Bitmin,"naw it's more like they go ""Can I use the photocopier? I need to make some copies."" and you're 33% more likely to let them use it than if they just ask ""Can I use the photocopier?"""
Bitmin,i like my version better
Bitmin,@The Rona due to the strike instead of my final math exam being cumulative of everything we've learned its only about logarithms and straight lines
Bitmin,ez marks
Bitmin,we couldn't even finish the logarithms unit so its only the easy logarithm stuff
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,In addition if you add the word because it increases your likelyhood i.e
Bitmin,"""I need to use the photocopier because I am in a rush and need to make copies"""
Bitmin,Are you in a psych class?
Bitmin,based on what the study was comparing (actually having a reason vs. having a sentence structure that sounds like a reason but isn't) that would be around the same as just saying that you're in a rush
Bitmin,naw I just stumbled across it

Bitmin,I thought you were dorm boys
Bitmin,dorm is really only a first-year thing in canada
Bitmin,Devon lives at home because the school is close
Bitmin,Dank
Bitmin,I go to a different school than him though
Bitmin,You go to waterloo right?
Bitmin,Yup
Bitmin,daNK
Bitmin,art thou in their coop stuff?
Bitmin,"Im in a ""Digital literacy class that is an absolute meme"
Bitmin,"cause they have like, the best co op in the country"
Bitmin,This is for people whomstve havent even used computers basically
Bitmin,plus you dont go to school everyday in college usually @Trapezoider
Bitmin,like i only have school 3 days a week
Bitmin,what
Bitmin,lucky bastard
Bitmin,There is a super attractive female next to me. Im gonna get her name tomorrow
Bitmin,Then number
Bitmin,I've always had five days a week
Bitmin,Welcome to college Sylki
Bitmin,Five days a week for me
Bitmin,but Im out by 1:30 everyday
Bitmin,I almost didn't this term but I had to move a course from first to second term so I'm right back on five days a week
Bitmin,welcome to mixing and matching your courses so you get a good schedule
Bitmin,and my stuff's mad spread out some days
Bitmin,although one of my days is 8-6
Bitmin,I'm not in a co-op program
Bitmin,I hate that shit
Bitmin,"today, I have 5 hours of class spread from 830am to 930pm"
Bitmin,I want all my classes to be back to back
Bitmin,I can still do it though if I want to
Bitmin,back to back classes is great
Bitmin,Wait doc you dont have females in your classes?
Bitmin,TF
Bitmin,"however, cause it's the first day of classes, I skipped my 830 cause they're just gonna go over the syllabus and I would only have had like 4 hours of sleep, and my 630-930 class got cancelled cause the prof has flu"
Bitmin,i have a 3 hour break on thursdays but me and my boys jsut go into town and get food during it
Bitmin,That's not what co-op means
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,Thats what is means here
Bitmin,co op is mixed school and work terms
Bitmin,so you get a fuckton of experience by the time you graduate
Bitmin,im aware of what co-op menas
Bitmin,"It's basicly like an internship where you go an work for a company, but you get paid"
Bitmin,andrew isn't tho
Bitmin,Ive always heard it in referring to genders
Bitmin,Thats dank as fuck
Bitmin,im in the college with the #1 rated co-op program in ontario
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,internships are actually paid pretty often
Bitmin,the terms are almost interchangeable at this point
Bitmin,just that internship can mean you don't get paid
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,you get paid in experience
Bitmin,yay
Bitmin,yeah but that blows
Bitmin,im gonna buy all the stuff with this experience ive earned
Bitmin,I ain't applying to no unpaid internships
Bitmin,what is the ratio of experience to bitcoins?
Bitmin,the same as the ratio of leprecauns to unicorns
Bitmin,http://puu.sh/yX1Jg/2cc62ab9e5.jpg
Bitmin,Anyone wanna buy .05 of a bitcoin
Bitmin,"thats like $10,000"
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,its $700 usd
Bitmin,no it really isnt
Bitmin,devon
Bitmin,"still, one thing I prefer from my school's internship stuff vs waterloo's coop is that waterloo does 4-month so you're basically in, trained, given some menial tasks for three months then booted out, whereas we do full-year stuff so you actually get better experience"
Bitmin,http://puu.sh/yX1L4/3087ec02dd.png
Bitmin,you are fucking wrong
Bitmin,"bitcoin are $15,000 usd"
Bitmin,"15,000 * .05 =$750"
Bitmin,What are you smoking?
Bitmin,he said .05 not .5
Bitmin,oh you said .05
Bitmin,DORK
Bitmin,not used to people not putting a 0 before hte decimal place
Bitmin,fucking americans
Bitmin,Those god damned yankees
Bitmin,that's not uncommon here
Bitmin,just not super common either
Bitmin,bruh i aint never seen it
Bitmin,wut
Bitmin,is the GTA just like a mini america inside ontario
Bitmin,Devon I can assure you that we have seen it
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,cause dont you people call like chapstick blisterrods or something
Bitmin,basically
Bitmin,we also have aids here
Bitmin,lol not really
Bitmin,@The Rona well im sure if i actually looked at the board during math call i'd have seen it
Bitmin,also I've literally never heard the word 'blisterrod' in my life but it sounds horrible
Bitmin,what do you call chapsticks
Bitmin,isnt there like a wierd nickname
Bitmin,i could've sworn
Bitmin,"sometimes it goes by one of the brand names (blistex), like kleenex instead of tissues"
Bitmin,blistex
Bitmin,thats what it was
Bitmin,but that might be a french canadian thing honestly I have no idea in my house
Bitmin,fair
Bitmin,FAIR
Bitmin,FAIR
Bitmin,FAIR

Bitmin,WRONG
Bitmin,Oh
Bitmin,"THIS IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL, POSSIBLY EVER"
Bitmin,I wonder how many asterixes (asterices?) you can add before things break
Bitmin,4
Bitmin,"one
two
three
four
five"
Bitmin,You can add up to 4
Bitmin,why did my four not work
Bitmin,Gya

Bitmin,
Bitmin,max it means I left 3 hours after
Bitmin,and just got home because I got asked to go buy groceries
Bitmin,Still down?
Bitmin,I'm eating but I'll play after
Bitmin,GUYS! I NEED HELP! I feel like characters on the left are a stolen design of characters from the Fate Series. If you've seen the Fate series please help me out here!
Bitmin,"I mean, same hair eye color"
Bitmin,there are a few Fate parody type things
Bitmin,they might be from one of those
Bitmin,where did you find this?
Bitmin,"I made it myself, I took the left screenshots from an anime, I don't know the name of it, but the opening is called Apron Boy"
Bitmin,"When I first saw these characters, I initially thought it was an ending to a Fate anime, but then I saw that it was an opening and not even the same series"
Bitmin,is it from this? https://myanimelist.net/anime/37033/Emiya-san_Chi_no_Kyou_no_Gohan
Bitmin,Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan
Bitmin,A Fate/stay Night spin-off focused on cooking.
Bitmin,I think it is.
Bitmin,"well yeah, it's not stolen then it's just a spin-off"
Bitmin,besides I don't think character theft is a thing that happens in the anime industry
Bitmin,but what do I know
Bitmin,"Thanks for clearifying that, and I didn't think they were stealing the characters, I thought they were stealing the designs and naming them different characters"
Bitmin,"But one last thing I do find strange is that, Spin-Offs (or at least the ones I've seen) usually have a different cast of characters with members of the previous cast making side appearances. But I could be wrong"
Bitmin,I haven't seen many spin-offs so I don't really know. I guess there's just different ways to do it
Bitmin,maybe
Bitmin,@Trapezoider I'm ready
Bitmin,@Trapezoider We playing PUBG or not?
Bitmin,I'm cracking up
Bitmin,this kid I know from kingston used to play tf2
Bitmin,apparently
Bitmin,one of his teammates thought he was a girl
Bitmin,and was kinda sorta hitting on him constantly
Bitmin,which the kid didn't discourage
Bitmin,it eventually culminated in the guy buying the kid a csgo knife
Bitmin,he is living the trap dream
Bitmin,Did the guy ever find out?
Bitmin,yeah after awhile the kid felt kinda bad and told him and asked if he wanted the knife back
Bitmin,"to which the reply was basically 'naw you're a chill dude, keep it'"
Bitmin,wow what a guy
Bitmin,why give hte knife back
Bitmin,he scammed it fair and square
Bitmin,How expensive was the knife?
Bitmin,um
Bitmin,lemme check
Bitmin,"according to the steam market, $81.45"
Bitmin,Not bad
Bitmin,so like $65 usd
Bitmin,respectable scam
Bitmin,i used to scam people in warframe out of platinum
Bitmin,made like ~$200 worth of plat off it
Bitmin,I'm fufilling my namesake
Bitmin,Time to start scamming bibbas by fufilling mh destiny

Bitmin,never have I ever seen such a comprehensive plot twist
Bitmin,something that somehow seeped into like... everything
Bitmin,What are you reading?
Bitmin,it's part of an unfinished series (book 3 of an eventual 10)
Bitmin,"The Stormlight Archives, by Brandon Sanderson (my favourite author, and probably his best series thus far)"
Bitmin,fucking impressive plot twist
Bitmin,it was even the kind of thing where it's like 'there is going to be a plot twist about this'
Bitmin,but I was not expecting anything like this

Bitmin,When your parents leave can you join voice?
Bitmin,also is genesis tomorrow
Bitmin,No I can play
Bitmin,Wen I went down
Bitmin,They told me not to play games
Bitmin,So I gotta wait
Bitmin,Genesis is this weekend
Bitmin,early events may start thursday or friday though
Bitmin,I am probably going to start on falco
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,After that we can play Shiek Falcon
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,yeah?
Bitmin,"random thought - we have the term 'shot dead' for someone who is shot, and dies from it, but we don't have similar terms for other ways of dying or getting killed"
Bitmin,no 'stabbed dead' or 'drowned dead' or 'heart attacked dead'
Bitmin,english is weird
Bitmin,we're the only language where a double positive can result in a negative
Bitmin,wait how
Bitmin,yeah right
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,I will still hold up verbal quebecois french as the most comprehensive idiomatic butchering of a language
Bitmin,four twenties ten 
Bitmin,naw that's just the language
Bitmin,I'm aware
Bitmin,I'm talking more the degree to which they mash english in and randomly remove syllables
Bitmin,fuck saying 'petit' (small) let's just say 'tit
Bitmin,"fuck saying 'voiture' (car), two syllables is too many let's just use the english word for it"
Bitmin,le tit snow
Bitmin,"also, in some rural regions in quebec they just randomly add 'la la' to the end of every sentence despite it having no semantic meaning within the sentence"
Bitmin,also they invented a completely separate set of swear words
Bitmin,which results in some truly unique cussing that you just don't really get to see in english
Bitmin,"because they'll mash together quebecois swearing, french swearing, and english swearing"
Bitmin,cause each language's/dialect's swearing has different stuff that's considered swearing so you can get really inventive
Bitmin,I've almost paid for pubg by selling crates
Bitmin,Nice
Bitmin,How much dollar
Bitmin,I haven't been playing since the update so no crates for me
Bitmin,Also Jed can you hang this weekend irl?

Bitmin,Were you heavily invested in cryptocurrencies @Trapezoider ?
Bitmin,what caused the crypto bubble to finally burst?
Bitmin,"dammit. I had a controller coming in for a bunch of fighting game stuff, was supposed to arrive tomorrow, but they showed up today only no one was home cause it wasn't supposed to come till tomorrow so they just took it back till tomorrow"
Bitmin,it literally changed nothing from my expectations but I could have had it tonight and that makes me mad
Bitmin,"fuck you too psychology, why'd you invent loss aversion"
Bitmin,I'm not sure whats happening today but I just had a perfect game in rivals the other guy didn't even touch me
Bitmin,everything seemed really slow
Bitmin,"I've only ever had one such game. They are rare and special, I hope you enjoyed it."
Bitmin,so I put a sandwich in the toster oven (wanted to heat the insides too)
Bitmin,"the top slice of bread, the one exposed to the air, burned to a crisp"
Bitmin,"the bottom one, the one pressed against the hot metal?"
Bitmin,"lightly toasted, slightly damp"
Bitmin,I do not understand thermodynamics

Bitmin,Is the tournament over?
Bitmin,your match is now

Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,I'm watching genesis.
Bitmin,quitter
Bitmin,i said I concede. Kameron is a better smash player
Bitmin,Thats just frustrating man to have two years of practice shat on by someone who has been playing for a month
Bitmin,he has been taking training from me
Bitmin,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitmin,like actually training not just random friendlies
Bitmin,also let this be a lesson to work on your mentality
Bitmin,if you took my lessons seriously you would be way better
Bitmin,mentality isn't a joke
Bitmin,if you don't mind getting bodied you'll play way better
Bitmin,was a huge turning point for me
Bitmin,I mind getting bodied by someone who has been playing for 1/32 the amount of time I have
Bitmin,huge ego destruction
Bitmin,"like if you watch the handful of sets I'm on stream, I'm laughing at myself and me getting bodied and silly things"
Bitmin,going in with a positive attitude literally makes everything better
Bitmin,be happy for the other person doing sick stuff to you
Bitmin,"and afterwards consider what you could have done better, what worked, and what didn't"
Bitmin,keep the negativity for analyzing yourself later
Bitmin,The reason you are not good with your number of hours is because your hours are not meaningful. They are just random friendlies. You don't watch as many tournaments as Kameron (which I consider to be very important) so he knows how top level players move and combo. He also takes advice all the time while you just want to play a specific way and are too stubborn.
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane I challenge you to a best of 9 set january 27th at 11pm EST
Bitmin,why an even number
Bitmin,do best of 7 or 9

Bitmin,RIP Sylki's backpack~ Unknown-2018
Bitmin,amazon same day delivery
Bitmin,I'm barely gonna be home today and if you miss the delivery stuff gets weird here
Bitmin,and I'd have ot go way out of my way to the UPS place to pick it up

Bitmin,Same
Bitmin,unless its something super expensive like a phone
Bitmin,student housing is too sketchy for that here

Bitmin,Sweet. I'll review those on my lunch break
Bitmin,Sylki do you ever miss classes?
Bitmin,occasionally
Bitmin,I don't recommend it
Bitmin,my basic rule is I will skip review classes of stuff I already know really well or early morning classes if I get less than 5 hours of sleep
Bitmin,or classes where the prof is so legendarily awful that it's easier and faster to skip the class and read the slides
Bitmin,That's a good rule to follow. I had to miss one today and I kinda wanted To die.
Bitmin,Ugh my teachers are lazy and don't make slides
Bitmin,just make sure yoou catch up on what you missed
Bitmin,Thankfully we have blackboard and I can do everything from I class online. Do you guys use blackboard?

Bitmin,No one else was sandbagging
Bitmin,Cause we got really good turnout
Bitmin,One of the matches has a score of 420-69
Bitmin,"Sylki before the tourney ""I can win if i dont have to play dayman"""
Bitmin,gets dayman in losers quarters
Bitmin,feelsbadman
Bitmin,This is why maining a character outside of the top 7 is a bad idea
Bitmin,Bracket luck can decide the tournament for you
Bitmin,but like
Bitmin,only fox can deal with puff
Bitmin,This matchup is worse than most
Bitmin,any top tier except peach would be better
Bitmin,"peach-puff, the most interesting to watch matchup known to melee"
Bitmin,also like 8-2

Bitmin,k
Bitmin,Brb
Bitmin,dem custom skins are wack
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,mostly don't look like what they say they look like
Bitmin,also it'll take one hell of a skin to make me give up on my coral kragg
Bitmin,coral krag?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,@Trapezoider coral kragg
Bitmin,I always get a bit sad looking at the really nice custom skins I have for characters I never play -_-
Bitmin,god this assignment is annoying
Bitmin,"""There is no solution to this. Just try to find the closest thing you can."""
Bitmin,and it's not like math where you can get an answer that still has some variables in it
Bitmin,there's literally no way to get from the starting point to an equivilant - if vague - end point
Bitmin,@here games?
Bitmin,maybe in a bit I've got a bit more work to do
Bitmin,cool-cool
Bitmin,
Bitmin,@Zain I'll preorder as soon as you do
Bitmin,but I thought you had to preorder it before the closed beta started
Bitmin,but idk
Bitmin,@SWIRL GIRL if you pre order now you get into the closed beta everyone is playing right now but I don't think am gonna buy it cuz it ends in like 2 days I'll prob buy it when I comes out
Bitmin,I have found a kragg skin that I would replace my coral kragg with
Bitmin,shame you have to buy it
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Now I'm hungry.
Bitmin,Yeah burrito kragg is cool
Bitmin,oh also kameron a top etalus confirmed with me that orcane beats etalus
Bitmin,no word on orcane kragg yet though
Bitmin,Once you get to the top tho matchups matter less
Bitmin,Still true tho
Bitmin,I somehow ended up in a weird roa discord for ontario/quebec and it seems pretty chill
Bitmin,also we might be entering a crew in a tournament where the winning team gets burrito kragg skins
Bitmin,I doubt I'm good enough to be on the crew though
Bitmin,What's the name of it?
Bitmin,it's only for ontario/quebec people
Bitmin,so I doubt you're in it
Bitmin,Aight
Bitmin,Just know there's a crew tourny coming up that my crews gonna be in
Bitmin,aight now I have to try to get into this crew if it's the same tournament
Bitmin,I want to die
Bitmin,I just spent 20 minutes debugging a four-line program
Bitmin,how
Bitmin,the problem was I used the wrong kind of quotation marks
Bitmin,...
Bitmin,"' ' instead of "" """
Bitmin,fuck haskell
Bitmin,like if its 4 lines id literally jsut rewrite hte htiung
Bitmin,I did
Bitmin,it still didn't work
Bitmin,cause apparently haskell's picky about your quotation marks
Bitmin,but the error message won't tell you that htat's the problem
Bitmin,it was telling me the problem was on the line after that
Bitmin,well i mean wanting you to actually use quotation marks rather than apostrophes isnt really picky
Bitmin,every other language I've ever used doesn't care
Bitmin,they've always been the same thing
Bitmin,but now they're not
Bitmin,and I can't tell what the actual difference is
Bitmin,i spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why my program kept skipping an input and realized i have a buffer overflow
Bitmin,ah that's always fun
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether GOML 2018 might have RoA
Bitmin,Nice
Bitmin,anyone who might show if it does? cause apparently they're trying to gauge interest atm

Bitmin,(went from 2/19 to 8/25)
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak is the crew tourny you're talking about called the frozen burrito?
Bitmin,yaw
Bitmin,sadly the ontario discord had already put a team in so I can't even challenge someone for a slot
Bitmin,might make my own crew
Bitmin,Yeah it's not exclusive to canada
Bitmin,didn't think it was?
Bitmin,just that we were gonna put out a local(ish) crew
Bitmin,I thought you said it was only for Toronto/Quebec or whatevrt
Bitmin,Ah I get what you mean I think
Bitmin,is your crew entering?

Bitmin,sub for what?
Bitmin,The rivals of Aether tournament
Bitmin,I'm in a crew @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,well if we get max and a sub we're still fine
Bitmin,Silky can you sign us up then because I'm at school  and I won't be home till after the deadline
Bitmin,well I need confirmation from max and a sub
Bitmin,@Max @Feral Nebula max will you play for us and ava will you sub. You probably wont have toplay but if you for some reason do
Bitmin,could you?
Bitmin,when is it?
Bitmin,it's spread over next week
Bitmin,presumably in the evenings
Bitmin,we probably won't need you but you have to sign up with four and a sub
Bitmin,"sure, I guess I'll sub. I'm not that good at the game though so if I do play I'll probably lose"

Bitmin,need to finish a lab and shower but after that I'd be down
Bitmin,how long do you think thatll be?
Bitmin,hour or two
Bitmin,not sure how long the lab's gonna take
Bitmin,"and especially because it's a programming thing built around a concept I've never actually used before, it could be super simple or take ages"
Bitmin,this is some of the worst debugging I've ever written
Bitmin,there's so much redundant stuff
Bitmin,but it was useful like half an hour ago

Bitmin,you know what I always say @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,programming isn't real
Bitmin,I feel you
Bitmin,the sooner you realize this the sooner you can accept it
Bitmin,yo the rivals character select screen is organised by element type
Bitmin,totally just realised that
Bitmin,Dude
Bitmin,so the last character will be air
Bitmin,I knew that
Bitmin,And I don't play
Bitmin,shhh\
Bitmin,@Jed you wanna try out that weird version of rivals with me?
Bitmin,sure
Bitmin,"alright, technically I can beat jed"
Bitmin,"practically, it takes like 15 tries and a lot of salt"
Bitmin,ranno's jank
Bitmin,so are platforms

Bitmin,the count was 11-3 or
Bitmin,but some of those were sylvanos

Bitmin,@Bitmin where you at?
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,are the numbers you chose for peoples id's random or do they have meaning
Bitmin,My plan was to never actually mention what someones number was but others have given specific numbers. I would guess that they are random but you should check with whoever wrote the chapter.
Bitmin,okay just making sure no one has some foreshadowing on those numbers or a purpose to them
Bitmin,In college business class
Bitmin,professor asks someone to give description of what supply and demand means
Bitmin,I give description

Bitmin,I'm not really sure what to do so for now I'm just kinda letting him stay

Bitmin,Do you guys get why im such an elon fan now?

Bitmin,Im super triggered
Bitmin,That was so cool though

Bitmin,Let's get these dates locked down ASAP
Bitmin,dont you already know mine?
Bitmin,Ye but send me your schedule
Bitmin,For summer
Bitmin,@Zain @Feral Nebula @Trapezoider @Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane @The Rona The spreadsheet has been made and should be in your email
Bitmin,"So bros, my parents track my phone and are super oedipal and annoying about knowing where I am. Today however I found a very convienient app that can spoof my location. :) Life just got a lot better"
Bitmin,lol gg dude
Bitmin,
Bitmin,on a scale from 1 to tm06 how toxic is this
Bitmin,@Homiesgames?
Bitmin,"andrew, I feel for you and all, but I'm pretty sure oedipal is not the right word"
Bitmin,oedipus (or however you spell it) was the guy who banged his mum and killed his dad
Bitmin,I'm gonna assume you just meant anal
Bitmin,"as in anal retentitive, as in super control-freak-y"
Bitmin,if you can spoof your location you can fool your parents but also think of how easy it would be to play pokemon go
Bitmin,@here games?
Bitmin,shut the heck up
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,"apparently, if every chicken dinner in pubg was an actual chicken dinner, enough have occurred that you could feed the population of iceland for a year"
Bitmin,I don't know who goes through the trouble of figuring this stuff out
Bitmin,but it's great
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak melee or pubg or somethin?
Bitmin,naw studying atm
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,got midterms next week
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak post that canada pic about the population
Bitmin,what if he don't
Bitmin,i cri
Bitmin,I don't have it
Bitmin,it was never me
Bitmin,pretty sure ocean man's got it
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak pretty sure oedipal was the word I was looking for. In my context it means the helicopter mother and father who are emotionally dependant on me and take away responsibility I should have for myself by being over protective and over bearing
Bitmin,dude raisins are gay
Bitmin,craisins however
Bitmin,NUT
Bitmin,but that's not what happened in the story
Bitmin,
Bitmin,he was abandoned
Bitmin,I'm not talking about the story????
Bitmin,cause prophecy saying he'd kill his dad and murder his mum
Bitmin,It's a word from frued
Bitmin,but that's where the term comes from?
Bitmin,he used it in the context of the story
Bitmin,Pretty sure it's from civilization and it's discontents
Bitmin,oedipos complex is freud's thing
Bitmin,Oedipos and oedipal are different
Bitmin,http://www.dictionary.com/browse/oedipal
Bitmin,the definition of oedipal
Bitmin,https://youtu.be/EPAfS8-wm8g
Bitmin,Jordan Peterson: Female Pathology (The Oedipal Mother)
Bitmin,Full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek
Bitmin,I think we're having a definitional mismtach here
Bitmin,I need to update my knowledge of this topic
Bitmin,'spose they're different meanings for the same word
Bitmin,I was running off that video essentially
Bitmin,"but in common perception, oedipus-related stuff immediately goes the mother-fucking route"
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,a statement which is based in a different psychologist's work -_-
Bitmin,"Yeah I read your definition and I was like ""fuuuuccckk"""
Bitmin,Basically sees his dad as a sexual rival lmao
Bitmin,jung get out of our freud-based discussion dammit
Bitmin,That's fucked up dude
Bitmin,Yeah get the fuck out Jung
Bitmin,eh I like Jung's stuff honestly
Bitmin,who tf is Jung?
Bitmin,Fucking coming in here with your collective unconscience
Bitmin,Stupid bitch
Bitmin,"well the main thing is the idea of the collective unconscience, which is ironically usually misunderstood"
Bitmin,Jed he was essentially Sigmund Freud 2.0
Bitmin,aight
Bitmin,"the way jung has it is that it's the collection of ideas, archetypes, and such that are common to basically everyone - symbols that pretty much everyone will understand and associate with the same things"
Bitmin,"amusingly, the collective unconscience is often represented as a literal collective, shared part of the uncounscious mind that is in some way attached between people"
Bitmin,so the collective unconscience isn't really a part of the collective unconscience
Bitmin,"also Jung and Freud were pretty different in how they approached stuff, from what I remember"
Bitmin,although Jung did carry on some of Freud's stuff I'm pretty sure mmost of his theories were pretty different
Bitmin,it's been awhile since I took psych so I'm gonna go dig this up
Bitmin,While we wait for sylkis notes
Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether Jed?
Bitmin,for a little bit
Bitmin,sylki do you know a rivals player named sableye?
Bitmin,he is in Ontario I think
Bitmin,he's in that discord but other than that I dunno
Bitmin,aight
Bitmin,@Trapezoider get in nerd
Bitmin,"they both worked a lot with the unconscious, but Freud focused more on repressed, but still present stuff, as well as the id/ego/superego stuff and the kinda wacky psychosexual stuff for describing behaviour, whereas Jung focused more on the shared stuff between people, how we understand society and ourselves in relation to it"
Bitmin,sadly one of the major reasons I remember as much about Jung as I do is that the persona games kinda swooped in and built a lot of the series off his theories (especially Personas 4&5) - Jung is literally the guy who came up with the term 'Persona' in the way that it's generally used today

Bitmin,but only once a week
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,okay it comes out similar then
Bitmin,America is retarded but definitely not that retarded
Bitmin,"2x12x3=72
8x5=40"
Bitmin,TIL you cant use * to show multiplication on discord
Bitmin,Ye i just checked my calculator because something didnt seem right with me saying they were close
Bitmin,32 hour difference
Bitmin,LYike
Bitmin,TBH you can easily cover it all in 32 hours especially if you have them back to back
Bitmin,so its not that wack
Bitmin,40*
Bitmin,my issue i couldn't finish was hte distance swim
Bitmin,i mean i did finish it
Bitmin,but barely
Bitmin,how long?
Bitmin,300 m right?
Bitmin,1600m in 12 mins
Bitmin,did you have to do the brick?
Bitmin,100m pool 16 lengths
Bitmin,oh yeah the brick was fine
Bitmin,Brick = ez
Bitmin,the brick was weird cause you could jsut stand on the bottom
Bitmin,without floating back up
Bitmin,TF?
Bitmin,We did it in the deep end
Bitmin,yeah no im saying
Bitmin,when you are at the bottom of the pool usually you float up
Bitmin,@Max Melee?
Bitmin,but with the brick you can just stay on the bottom
Bitmin,so it felt weird
Bitmin,Oh yeah
Bitmin,I like chilling on the bottom with the brick
Bitmin,same
Bitmin,Sneaky snekking my way around
Bitmin,Grabbing peoples legs
Bitmin,we always had to cram the swimming stuff in the first hour cause for the second hour the synchro team would take like half hte pool
Bitmin,so it meant even when our instructor was just talking to us we had to focus on not sinking since we could only have the deep end
Bitmin,Are you going to complete your certs?
Bitmin,i really should
Bitmin,@Trapezoider how do I aquire such a test drive
Bitmin,go on the website and apply
Bitmin,here ill send link
Bitmin,wait shit you have to be 21. I need to cancel 
Bitmin,Lmao
Bitmin,Rip
Bitmin,finishing your certs isn't that that hard
Bitmin,so long as you have decent eggbeater you're fine
Bitmin,I got mine and then never managed to actually get a lifeguarding job -_-
Bitmin,now they're pretty much all expired
Bitmin,I'd have to do all the hardest ones all over again
Bitmin,mango is at the cs_summit
Bitmin,eggbeater?
Bitmin,treading water with legs only technique
Bitmin,super useful for carrying people
Bitmin,especially for spinals where you have to move at a constant pace or risk causing way more damage
Bitmin,@Trapezoider for spinals do they teach the Canadian hold thingy in the states?
Bitmin,.+
Bitmin,for spinals we actually use a backboard and try to stabilize as best we can until the backboard can be used
Bitmin,The goal is to get the person into shallow water and maintain stability of the spinal erector and neck
Bitmin,Since we dont really know the extent of a given injury
Bitmin,Man sylki you and I become more and more similar the more i get to know you
Bitmin,
Bitmin,wait did they not teach you spinal carry stuff for before you can get them to the board?
Bitmin,They did but I dont remember 
Bitmin,dammit now I don't get to know if they taught you canadian carry
Bitmin,which they'd better have cause it's the best
Bitmin,I have no idea :(
Bitmin,

Bitmin,highest HP boss in the history of gaming:
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I see your boss and raise you http://xenoblade.wikia.com/wiki/Gradivus%2C_the_Headless_Emperor
Bitmin,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor"
Bitmin,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor (Japanese: 首無皇帝グラデウス, Kubinashi Kōtei Guradeusu) is a Tyrant in Xenoblade Chronicles X. It is a member of the Millesaur family. It can be found at level 71 at the..."
Bitmin,"100,000,040 health"
Bitmin,also for the record this is a lv71 enemy in a game where the level cap is 60
Bitmin,i see your boss and I raise you again (i found this on reddit)
Bitmin,also where'd the extra 40 come from on that xenoblade boss?
Bitmin,no idea
Bitmin,but that is its health
Bitmin,the post-game bosses in this game are stupidly strong
Bitmin,cause there's a lot of weird optimization stuff
Bitmin,there's a boss that's 39 levels above the level cap
Bitmin,ie a lv99 when your max level is 60
Bitmin,that I can understand a little because they wanted to make it like other RPGs where the level cap is 99
Bitmin,"I tried taking it on as a joke at lv56, I got one shot"
Bitmin,tpk in one hit
Bitmin,you have to optimize so hard to win
Bitmin,I remember one time I took on a boss (which I didn't think was a secret boss) at a low level and I got one shot. I took me about three days to realize that he actually was a secret boss.
Bitmin,"I generally try to stay away from RPGs that require the use of so many complicated game mechanics (like optimizations, synthesising, equipment boosting, etc). Most of the ones I play have them, but I can ignore them and still manage to beat the game (main story at least)."
Bitmin,main story's totally manageable without any particular optimization
Bitmin,but they left some crazy stuff in for the crazy people
Bitmin,so they'd have some ridiculous completionist challenge
Bitmin,"yeah. For me, I just really only play games for their story aspect. If I really enjoyed it I'll go back and try to 100% it."
Bitmin,"same, but I do think it's cool"
Bitmin,also the particular crazy enemies are super interesting in terms of design and lore in this game
Bitmin,"intersting. I've never tried a Xenoblade game, but now I'm curious. Any recommandations to start with?"
Bitmin,start with the original
Bitmin,if you've got a wiiu/switch I think you can get it on the virtual console
Bitmin,xbc1 is one of my top 2 rpgs
Bitmin,I don't have a wiiu or a switch
Bitmin,ooooor you can just emulate it
Bitmin,unless you want to pay like $100 for a wii copy
Bitmin,yeha no thanks
Bitmin,xbcx is pretty good but it's more worldbuilding and sidequests than a direct story
Bitmin,haven't played xbc2 cause I don't have a switch
Bitmin,"also I don't know how the timeline of xbc1 and 2 work, but xbcx is totally separate"
Bitmin,is xb a wiiu/switch specific game?
Bitmin,it's nintendo specific
Bitmin,ah that explains it
Bitmin,"original was wii, X was wiiu, 2 is switch"
Bitmin,I'm really more of a ps fan
Bitmin,have you played any of the persona games?
Bitmin,I wanted to play persona 4 but I wasn't old enough when it came out. I DESPERATELY want to play Persona 5! I looks SOO COOL!
Bitmin,god p5 is good
Bitmin,it's the other of my two favourite rpgs
Bitmin,if you've got ps3 I think there's versions of personas 3-5
Bitmin,"p3 has versions for ps2, ps3, and psp, p4 for ps2 and ps3, and p5 for ps3 and ps4"
Bitmin,i have both a 3 and a 4 so I'm kinda in luck
Bitmin,yeee get p5
Bitmin,I'm trying to
Bitmin,is it hard to find a copy? or just not enough money?
Bitmin,not enough money
Bitmin,aw
Bitmin,just starve yourself for a week
Bitmin,it's worth it
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,"btw, if you like persona 5, are you going to watch the animation coming out soon? Just curious?"
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,"if possible I'd recommend playing before watching, the adaptations are a little less deep"
Bitmin,and especially in the case of p4 the pacing's wack
Bitmin,that is if they don't change the story progression first
Bitmin,both adaptations have been pretty faithful
Bitmin,I remember one of my favorite games got an anime adaption and it complete changed how the game was
Bitmin,slight changes to accomadate the protagonist not being a player-insert character
Bitmin,"but other than that, consistent"
Bitmin,admittadly the faithfulness is what caused the p4 adaptation to be weirdly paced
Bitmin,well yeah they kinda have to cram the possibly 20+ hour game into a 12 episode season
Bitmin,that sounds like it would end badly
Bitmin,"i wouldn't if they divided it over 2 seasons, which the anime adaption of my favorite game did but poorly"
Bitmin,20+ hours should probably be 50 episodes at least
Bitmin,"most likely, but you got to think, most of that time is possibly running around looking for what your doing, travel time, and filler content"
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,so theoetically it would really be 10-15 hours
Bitmin,"with persona games pre-5, they were like 60ish hours but a lot (probably 20-25 hours) was storyless combat, and they always have to trim side stuff (which is a lot of persona games), but they manage to fit just about all the important stuff in"
Bitmin,and that's what important. Though I don't mind the occational filler episode since they're the funniest
Bitmin,p4's got great filler
Bitmin,"cause it's so character focused, it doesn't even feel like filler"
Bitmin,I don't even know why you would put filler in a movie
Bitmin,movie where'd that come from? (and you wouldn't)
Bitmin,Persona 4's adaptation is a movie I think?
Bitmin,no it's an anime
Bitmin,naw that's backwards
Bitmin,"p4 is a 25 episode anime, p3 is 4(?) movies"
Bitmin,"but yeah, fillers can be good, as long as they progress the story or develop the characters even a little amongest all the fan service"
Bitmin,one of the p3 movies has one of the best hot springs bit I've ever seen
Bitmin,there's plenty of character development but it's also just funny
Bitmin,and not much fanservice
Bitmin,one of my favorite fan service bits from a game was a hot springs bonus scene from a game called Tales of Xillia 2. Oh my god it's freaking hallarious! You really don't even need to understand the game to think it's funny
Bitmin,basically what happens is the guys are swallowed by this living doll (that's actualyl a party member) because the girls didn't want them around. And they end up getting digested in the doll's stomach. It's the dialogue that makes it funny

Bitmin,Hey can we make our sylvannos guide?
Bitmin,The word still isnt out
Bitmin,eh go for it if you want to
Bitmin,release it now as well
Bitmin,on some non trapezoid yt
Bitmin,kk
Bitmin,just got in like a ten minute argument of me vs the majority of the ontario rivals discord about discord light vs discord dark
Bitmin,I have successfully convinced them that it's ok to use the light theme
Bitmin,so now hopefully no one's gonna get on my case for using it
Bitmin,Fuck you Sylki. I do not like you because you use white discord
Bitmin,that's racist
Bitmin,you don't like me cause I like white
Bitmin,"in all seriousness there are valid arguments against white, but 'it's too bright it hurts my eyes' is BS"
Bitmin,"it's the exact same white as like, everything else on your computer"
Bitmin,"behold, a screenshot of discord, where part of the picture is a screenshot of a word document"
Bitmin,IT'S THE EXACT SAME COLOUR
Bitmin,Ack! My eyes!
Bitmin,It burns
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,thai food is dope
Bitmin,uwu
Bitmin,Thai food is infact dope
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,Join the master race. Discord white is superior and all of the discord dark people can  kiss my ass
Bitmin,ew gross I didnt know you used discord light
Bitmin,we're not friends anymore
Bitmin,eat ass
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,go die
Bitmin,smoke grass
Bitmin,
Bitmin,and sled fast
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"""Sled fast, eat ass"" - Dan the Meme man"
Bitmin,"brief reasons why I use discord light:
1) anyone who says it's too bright is fucking stupid. It's the same white as everything else on your computer that uses white - word, facebook, google, etc. - and you can clearly manage it just fine there.
2) my eyes are borked and reading light text on dark background gives me brutal headaches if I do it for too long, which happened a bunch when I tried out discord dark.
These are objective facts. You can say you think discord dark looks better and that's fine, but don't try to tell me that it's too bright and don't tell me I should give myself brutal headaches to match your aesthetic sense."
Bitmin,Why do guys care about this so much?
Bitmin,It doesn't even matter.
Bitmin,except I have applied a dark skin to a majority of my web services
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,"I only care cause any time I put a screenshot up everyone goes 'ew discord light' and I feel victimized, you monsters"
Bitmin,and I always have discord up on my other monitor so it does tend to feel bright
Bitmin,so I feel the need to explain that due to actual physical problems discord light is better for me
Bitmin,There is nothing wrong with light
Bitmin,also I get annoyed at the 'it's too bright' thing
Bitmin,yeah that's fair
Bitmin,light's not right
Bitmin,but people like trap who just use it cause they are dumb
Bitmin,thats who we can make fun of
Bitmin,I still think it's dumb to make fun of people for preferring a different visual style
Bitmin,unelss they think ping pong the animation looks good
Bitmin,in which case hell yeah I'll make fun of them
Bitmin,hypocrisy intensifies

Ok everyone I know drowned in pools"
Bitmin,wait actually Dad made top 24
Bitmin,I'm not quite sure how because based on the bracket he just randomly appeared in loser's round of 24 and then lost 2-3
Bitmin,"he's not in any round before that, in winner's or loser's"
Bitmin,this bracket's super weird
Bitmin,it looks like a few people I know made it out of pools
Bitmin,but they all seem to appear in the main bracket at different places
Bitmin,and they all immediately lost

Bitmin,@Zain @Bitmin We are going to be playing a new social deception game later tonight if either of you wants to join
Bitmin,it's hella fun you should join us
Bitmin,I'll hopefully be able to acquire a working mic by then
Bitmin,is it coup
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,Can I join too?
Bitmin,sure
Bitmin,depending on how many we get we may need to split into two groups
Bitmin,is there a maximum number of players?
Bitmin,more than 4 would be awkward I think
Bitmin,you can't play with more than 7 but at that point it's a complete and total mess
Bitmin,why?
Bitmin,more than 4/5 would be hard
Bitmin,I want to keep it civil
Bitmin,"too many things to keep track of the more people you add, also you start running out of cards"
Bitmin,I think that having more people would be better because you can use the cards people have discarded by dying to try and figure out if someone's lying or not
Bitmin,The more players there are the less turns you get and the less each player matters
Bitmin,also you can't use cards people died and left behind
Bitmin,i suppose thats true
Bitmin,Okay but boys whats up with this http://puu.sh/zxS8Y/c9282f5e8f.png
Bitmin,too late

Bitmin,"Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl, yearns to live the life of a boy in the bustling city of Tokyo—a dream that stands in stark contrast to her present life in the countryside. Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture. One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.

Bitmin,"As a wild youth, elementary school student Shouya Ishida sought to beat boredom in the cruelest ways. When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school, while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends. Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the shadows of his past.

Bitmin,"Sylki, I'm here for you my man. If you need to study for a test thats like memorization stuff I'll do online flash card review with you. I don't know the concepts but I can question you on then if you give me a review packet.

I have heard a lot of the deep mind guys talk about linear algebra having direct technical uses in machine learning"

Bitmin,Is there any analogy you can draw from that to the maths?
Bitmin,Its mostly about representing linear equations from what I understand
Bitmin,yes but that's a super simple way of thinking about it

Bitmin,"@everyone I am proud to announce that I have made a new game called ""Combo Colors"". Unlike MCG, this game is not a battle arena card game like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. This game should appeal to a much wider audience, so even if you didn't like MCG, I would appreciate if you gave this one a try. The game will be having its first playtest tonight. Anyone who wants in please let me know!"
Bitmin,Sure I can be there.
Bitmin,what time?
Bitmin,"No defined time yet, I will provide an update on the time once I have a better idea how much longer production is going to take."
Bitmin,@everyone Development of Combo Colors is now complete. I'm aiming to have the playtest at 6:30 CST so try to show up around then if you want to try it out.
Bitmin,"Just so you know, this game is not strictly a 1v1 game. It can be played with 2-4 players."
Bitmin,didnt you already make a combo colors game?
Bitmin,"Yeah but this one is updated with new rules and features. In addition, a lot of the old cards have been removed or changed."
Bitmin,@Max  ready for Combo Colors?

Bitmin,Not actually but they're all pretty young
Bitmin,The thing about lag is its a two way street
Bitmin,Both people can use it

Bitmin,Tfw you think you're getting tinitus but then you track the high pitched ringing sound to your refrigerator
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,that is such a thing I would do
Bitmin,Tfw you've always had tinitus and thought that everyone else did too
Bitmin,How would you even figure out that everyone else doesn't?
Bitmin,I mentioned it to my mom one time like last year and she was like oh yeah that's not normal
Bitmin,Hey that's how I figured out it was a problem that I mostly only looked out of one eye
Bitmin,"Dominant eye is a thing, but it's not supposed to be that dominant"
Bitmin,But I didn't realize that until I told someone about it
Bitmin,how do you only look out of one eye ??
Bitmin,Long years of unintentionally trainin myself
Bitmin,Probably stemming from having had a lazy eye when I was really young
Bitmin,I've had to manually retrain myself the last two ish years
Bitmin,And its kinda sucked (lots of headaches)
Bitmin,But I'm pretty much fixed now except when I start to get really tired or spend too much time frequently changing focus
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,I shouldnt expect to have this correctly?
Bitmin,How do I test if I do?
Bitmin,Itd probably cost you but you could get it checked out by an optometrist
Bitmin,"In general though, you should be aware of the ability to swap focus between each of your eyes while pretty much completely ignoring the other, and a difficulty using both at once"
Bitmin,"A good simple test - hold two pencils out in front of your nose, one roughly 8-10 inches away and the other 2-3 times that. Focus on the close one, and in your non-focused field of view you should see two versions of the far pencil. Don't worry of this doesn't pop up immediately or if it's hard to look for the split while keeping your focus on the close one, worry if you can't do it at all or if it's really hard to get the split."
Bitmin,It's not a perfect test but it's something I had to train myself to be able to do and apparently it's a pretty normal thing most people can do
Bitmin,is it good or bad to get the split?
Bitmin,Good
Bitmin,Cause that means both eyes are focused up close
Bitmin,it happens pretty much automatically for me
Bitmin,"And since they both have different angles to the far one, it creates the split"
Bitmin,Yeah you're fine then
Bitmin,"Out of curiosity, are you able to unsplit while keeping your focus close (ie doing what I used to do automatically)"
Bitmin,let me try
Bitmin,no not really
Bitmin,the only way to remove the split is to focus on the far one
Bitmin,that's super weird
Bitmin,"Well that's good, odds are you'll never fall into the same trap I did"
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,Seems like im good
Bitmin,Thank you for all the insight
Bitmin,Are you close to being fully healed?
Bitmin,More or less
Bitmin,It still kicks I occasionally and a few things with it are still messed up (including the reading white text on dark background thing) but overall it's pretty much better

Bitmin,"whaaat, I didn't"

Bitmin,"Not yet, but Game Theroy made two videos breaking down Doki Doki and they concluded that it's getting a second game in 2018"
Bitmin,Based on Doki Doki's hidden backstory
Bitmin,I dunno if Game Theory has the authority to declare something like that 100%
Bitmin,More like gay theory tho
Bitmin,He wasn't the one who came up with it though. It was a whole ARG that people solved
Bitmin,"It's actually really cool and I'm super excited if this is true, which it most likely will be since they're pretty accurate with their theories"

Bitmin,theres a lot more weebs than that here
Bitmin,do you think it was possible for hte people in SaO
Bitmin,to like
Bitmin,fuck
Bitmin,ingame
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,why is that a topic of conversation
Bitmin,dont worry about it
Bitmin,it started off with some guy asking if he should get sea of thieves and we're here now
Bitmin,have you ever seen sao
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,and they never definitivley answer
Bitmin,if you cna fuck or not
Bitmin,like
Bitmin,the main bitch strips then smacks the dude in the face
Bitmin,but thats as close as they get
Bitmin,Imma say yes
Bitmin,But I'm no weeb so my opinion doesn't hold much water
Bitmin,well considering she did strip chances are its possible
Bitmin,As long as they have genitals and can experience tactile sensations
Bitmin,okay so one of my main bitches linked me some SaO Smut and apparently its cannon that they can fuck
Bitmin,its not actually smut im like 80% sure its a cannon novel
Bitmin,but dont quote me
Bitmin,yeah but the whole point of the question is we don't know if they do or not @ trap
Bitmin,Did the girl who stripped have genitals?
Bitmin,for some reason I read that like the girl had her genitals stripped
Bitmin,she stripped to her underwear so its unclear
Bitmin,"so i got my boy james on the whole genital issue and all he said was ""idk they had dicks and pussies in the hentai i watched"""
Bitmin,james is high rn so hes not super helpful
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,okay so like
Bitmin,the other girls in the guild have fucked b4
Bitmin,so id assume they have genitals
Bitmin,tfw you play too much counter strike and get carpal tunnel
Bitmin,yo we should get some 8 man pubg going sometime
Bitmin,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Bitmin,Yo somebody kick this guy
Bitmin,Yo I just saw a police officer take somebody off a train with a m4 assult rifle and they say Canada dosent have guns lol but truthfully sorta spooked me a little
Bitmin,Where the fuck do you get an M4 in Canada?
Bitmin,Did the cop have it or the dude
Bitmin,fusion had it
Bitmin,Oh duh
Bitmin,the cop lol but yes i also have an m4
Bitmin,Arrest this man
Bitmin,^^
Bitmin,Jed is there 8 man pubg now?
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,what did the suspect look like?@Zain
Bitmin,On test servers
Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,Cool
Bitmin,I have extra time tonight so I can play
Bitmin,@deleted-role please install your test server so we can play an 8 man tonight
Bitmin,@Jed we can probably get Brayden and Nick in here as well if we don't have enough people
Bitmin,Also Jed fuck hsel. Dude on the phone was retarded. Have to have everyone be from the same school. So stupid!
Bitmin,I mean I told you that
Bitmin,Yeah but one of their employees told me otherwise
Bitmin,Shaking m y h e a d
Bitmin,Also I asked them about it in their discord and they were super condesending
Bitmin,@Jed wanna join a cs team? We lost a guy and need a lurk
Bitmin,I mean I'm kinda bad
Bitmin,Also what's the time commitment?
Bitmin,"I think we'd be playing around 4 nights a week. It would basically take up the free time you spent on rifles in pubg to some degree I imagine, but I still think it would be pretty fun to be on the team together. Especially since I'm not complete ass at the game now"
Bitmin,Prolly not
Bitmin,Kk
Bitmin,@deleted-role who is down
Bitmin,can someone remove my pubg role?
Bitmin,done

Bitmin,I figured I would enter the rivals tournament tonight thinking I wouldn't go super far cause I knew I didn't have time to win it all
Bitmin,so I got into winners quarters and ended up beating the 1 seed
Bitmin,but had to dq myself in semis cause I had to leave FeelsBadMan
Bitmin,I was the 8 seed
Bitmin,Are you going to travel to lans
Bitmin,nah

Bitmin,west ballz was just in my ESEA match
Bitmin,It used to be better
Bitmin,I would recommend getting an apple fritter
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,"Yeah, they changed owners and the new people cut costs and not prices. At least the bagels are still solid"
Bitmin,Wasn't it Burger King who bought them or something?
Bitmin,Don't remember
Bitmin,Also I got a breakfast burrito from there one time and it actually was the most unexciting thing I have ever eaten. It didn't  taste like anything
Bitmin,Yup I fell in that trap too
Bitmin,Weirdly their breakfast bagel thing is actually pretty good
Bitmin,I've been bisswaded from buying any of their food that isn't a doughnut thanks to that burrito
Bitmin,Aight will keep my excitement down
Bitmin,However poutine I am looking forward to
Bitmin,where in canada are you going?
Bitmin,if it's anywhere other than quebec it probably won't be as good
Bitmin,I'm in Vancouver
Bitmin,eh still might be good
Bitmin,I would assume that the bigger Canadian cities have better poutine
Bitmin,Dope
Bitmin,I totally just made that up by the way
Bitmin,I mean I trust you as one of the resident Canadians
Bitmin,Did operation autism storm accrue in the journey up?
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,Nah
Bitmin,Just our fam
Bitmin,Oh wait

Bitmin,No it wasn't too bad
Bitmin,We sat for like an hour and a half at the border tho
Bitmin,Wat
Bitmin,wtf
Bitmin,I didn't know our border was that serious
Bitmin, Thought they were gonna find our cocaine  
Bitmin,Technically it's our border
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Technically he was in the states so false. It was our border blocking you damn dirty Canadians apes from entering this holy Land
Bitmin,Eat shit moose fucker
Bitmin,Nah
Bitmin,You cross the border before you get to customs
Bitmin,"Wait you're wrong. If I was driving into Buffalo, I would be stopped by the US border. When I come back I would be stopped by the Canadian border"
Bitmin,"Y
Yeah no you cross into Canada before you get through customs"
Bitmin,There is a park n shit
Bitmin,You have to go through customs when crossing the border?
Bitmin,No after
Bitmin,You know what I mean
Bitmin,I mean like the booth where they ask you questions and shit
Bitmin,It just occured to me that you probably took a plane
Bitmin,Thought that qualifies as customs
Bitmin,Nah we drove
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,Only like 7-8 hour drive
Bitmin,True
Bitmin,When you said customs I thought that you were referring to them checking your bags and stuff
Bitmin,Nah
Bitmin,They just asked like 5 questions and let us through
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,I know what you mean now when you say you cross first and then go through customs
Bitmin,Just tell them it's a human trafficking operation
Bitmin,yeet
Bitmin,So I got a new weather app
Bitmin,N0NE JUST REVERSED 3-0'D WIZZY

Bitmin,canadia/south american crazy cptn falcon player
Bitmin,this tournament's been crazy weird
Bitmin,"there was a point in bracket where I was looking at it, and it's like, can you imagine 3-0ing lucky and mike haze and then losing to ginger? and in the same match, can you imagine beating axe and then losing to 2saint?"
Bitmin,they both had crazy runs
Bitmin,"also, swedish 3-0'd axe, amsa 3-0'd pewpewu"
Bitmin,absentpage just beat llod? what?
Bitmin,Yoshi vs Marth is actually a pretty bad matchup for Marth.
Bitmin,he was playing fox
Bitmin,still impressive
Bitmin,and honestly that's the most minor upset I mentioned

Bitmin,I have defeated you
Bitmin,??
Bitmin,
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,I'm confused
Bitmin,it has something to do with fairy tail but other that I have no idea
Bitmin,"I just watched an episode of fairy tail where all the main characters turned into Batman. And they broke the fourth wall by saying ""oh no she's turned realistic"" considering such an odd episode I thought it might be funny enough to get you to watch so.e"
Bitmin,Some*
Bitmin,didn't work
Bitmin,Fuck
Bitmin,Nigerian whore sack
Bitmin,you're not supposed to start with saying you've defeated me
Bitmin,Somebody kick this guy
Bitmin,it encourages me to disprove you out of spite
Bitmin,also this wasn't particularly inspiring
Bitmin,Sylki I am determined to get you to watch this show
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak melee???
Bitmin,Sylki 1v1 me rust
Bitmin,"I'm more curious to know how DBZ wrangled its context to include the line ""Hold your fire, this man isn't black!"" with a straight face"
Bitmin,I can explain
Bitmin,If you watch fairy tail. I am a sucker for million episode shows
Bitmin,That never end :(
Bitmin,That is what long shows tend to do
Bitmin,Except fairy tail is over now
Bitmin,So is dbz
Bitmin,which is why they tend to suck
Bitmin,Except the movies that come out
Bitmin,"dragon ball is still going, dbz might be done"
Bitmin,Fairy tail definitely has some shitty story arcs not gonna lie
Bitmin,The highs are high but the lows are meh
Bitmin,"and my stance on super long shows is basically: I could watch several great short shows in this time, maybe I""ll do that instead"
Bitmin,What kind of show even is it?
Bitmin,the highs are bad the lows are terrible
Bitmin,why do you want someone to watch it with you so badly?
Bitmin,wait
Bitmin,ill watch it with you
Bitmin,i dont have anything better to do
Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,"so I'm gonna watch made in abyss, and re creators, and higurashi, and grimgar, and monster, eureka 7, and your lie in april, and monster, and a fuck ton of other stuff first"
Bitmin,"""the highs are bad the lows are terrible"" ""I'll watch it with you"" MAKES SENSE"
Bitmin,am down to watch a bad show
Bitmin,I mean it can be fun to watch something with the intention of laughing at it
Bitmin,you still haven't finished made in abyss???
Bitmin,a gonna have fun making fun of it
Bitmin,see: me watching girls und panzer

Bitmin,"Random thought: denotations of time make no sense. I mean days are reasonable - it's the time it takes to start dark, get light, then get dark again and you sleep in the middle - and so are years - turning of the seasons, earth going around the sun, etc. - but the rest are irrational. What is an hour? a minute? a second? a week? why do they fit so badly into each other? who designed this stupid system?"
Bitmin,Still better than the imperial system
Bitmin,I'm pretty sure the hour is used to tell the position of the sun
Bitmin,yeah but why are there 24 per dday
Bitmin,that's an arbitrary number
Bitmin,especially cause you can't see the sun for half the day
Bitmin,same thing with weeks
Bitmin,like I get it's pulled from god making the earth in seven days
Bitmin,but it's still weird
Bitmin,"at least months almost make sense cause thye're matched up to the cycles of the moon, sort of"
Bitmin,The system makes more or less sense depending on where you live
Bitmin,Also it takes 24 hours for the earth to complete one revolution on its center axis
Bitmin,yes but why TWENTY FOUR
Bitmin,like what is one hour that made us decide to use it as a measure of time? we have one day for one rotation of the earth
Bitmin,That doesn't not make 24 an arbiratry number trap
Bitmin,Yes it does
Bitmin,Because 24
Bitmin,>0
Bitmin,Get rekt
Bitmin,nerds
Bitmin,What
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Tfw ur mum gay
Bitmin,get  out of my christian minecraft server
Bitmin,Which one? @Jed
Bitmin,you heccin tard
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,When are you back?
Bitmin,At like 6
Bitmin,The ur mum gay bit was aimed at trap
Bitmin,Because with his logic the gay clearly transferred
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,gay traps > octagons and doctors
Bitmin,This just in the entire medical community is deemed worth less than one gay trap
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak time is done the way it is because it is in a base 6 number system
Bitmin,"60 seconds
60 minutes
24 hours"
Bitmin,all multiples of 6

Bitmin,he spends like 4/5 of it trashing the game but ends up recommending it anyway
Bitmin,also apparently yasunori mitsuda did the whole ost so I guess I'm buying a switch now

Bitmin,"well it's basically ""here's two million funny nitpicks, but overall the stuff that's good outweighs that"""
Bitmin,I herd that game is just waifu pokemon
Bitmin,"from what I've heard, everyone's got a ton of complaints but says it's great anyway"
Bitmin,"I'm prolly just gonna wait till smash switch comes out and then drop an obscene amount of money for a switch, smash 5, xb2, and mario oddessy"
Bitmin,which will mean I will have already bought more games for switch than I've bought for wiiu -_-
Bitmin,"unrelated, I just opened up an assignment that I've been procrastinating on but I kinda gotta start now cause it's due tomorrow, and the first question is basically 'State two reasons that (THING). Hint: One reason is (THING). Another reason is (ANOTHER THING)'"

Bitmin,Ill give you $10 at the gym
Bitmin,Are you going today?

Bitmin,When?
Bitmin,4-4:30 PST is start time
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,Buy that esea my guy. Ill pay you at the gym tomorrow
Bitmin,@deleted-role I have created a meetup planning document. Please join it.
Bitmin,"on my exam today I wrote one of the most disgusting single lines of code of my life, which I will try to replicate here:"
Bitmin,| mod (length list) 2 != 0 = take (((length list)/2) - 0.5) (zipWith (+) list (reverse list)) : (head (reverse (take (((length list)/2)+0.5) list)))
Bitmin,it's highly efficient but it's such a mess
Bitmin,What does this even do?
Bitmin,"A direct translation of what it's doing: it checks to see if the length of a list is divisible by two, and if it isn't, it takes the first half (rounded down) values from a new list that it creates where each element is the sum of an element in the list plus that same position in the list if the list was backwards, and then concatenates that to the first value of the reverse of the first half (rounded up) values in the original list

A more straightforward explanation: if a list cannot be divided into two halves of equal length, it creates a new list where each element is the sum of the list folded over onto itself (so the first value plus the last, the second value plus the second last, etc., and the final value is just the middle value)"
Bitmin,"normally I would not do that in a single line, but in haskell you kinda sorta gotta unless you want to write ten times as much code"
Bitmin,I originally wrote out the whole function (which is more than just that) as way more code but I had spare time so I decided to write out the more efficient version I figured out halfway through an unrelated question later on the exam
Bitmin,I condensed like a page of code into three extremely disgusting lines
Bitmin,of which that was the worst
Bitmin,Damn son
Bitmin,also I get to cheerfully come home and start studying for my monday exam -_-
Bitmin,"someone put together a single slide deck of all the slides the prof said to study, and this is on the first slide"
Bitmin,fuck me

Bitmin,@Zain thats too bad
Bitmin,@Zain sorry buddy :(
Bitmin,Are you getting hit by this storm as well @Zain
Bitmin,Does anyone know if hereditary memes can change the gene pool of a population to express different phenotypes more or less?
Bitmin,Memes are not hereditary
Bitmin,Hereditary memes?
Bitmin,are you okay?
Bitmin,Memes as in the cultural ideas that pass from mind to mind as first proposed by Richard Dawkins are hereditary in a sense. If you parents possess the meme of religion you are more likely to receive this meme from then
Bitmin,Religion is not a meme
Bitmin,That's not what he means by meme
Bitmin,A meme is a unit of cultural evolution
Bitmin,Religion is something that has evolved over time with culture
Bitmin,Religion = scientific meme
Bitmin,Not funny meme
Bitmin,memes predate religion
Bitmin,The reason I ask is because I have noticed a quarelation between religious females and their attractiveness. Not to say there aren't attractive atheist.
Bitmin,I have actually noticed this too
Bitmin,what
Bitmin,"I might just have the ""I grew up in a Christian home"" bias"
Bitmin,saying you find religious ones more attractive?
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Possibly
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,There appears to be a quarelation greater than .6 linking thicc and religiosity
Bitmin,are you sure its not just confirmation bias?
Bitmin,I'm not
Bitmin,"There has actually been research that conservatives are on average more attractive. So since most Christians are conservative, maybe that is the correlation."
Bitmin,I want to test it
Bitmin,Research must be done
Bitmin,For science
Bitmin,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Bitmin,Yes. Go upto attractive women and ask them if they are religious
Bitmin,Then ask for their number
Bitmin,I told you about that movie thing right
Bitmin,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Tell us
Bitmin,oh well one of my buds from West was like hey do you want to go to a movie with me and some other people
Bitmin,like its only him and girls at first so he invited me
Bitmin,and I was like aight I hadn't hung out with him for a while so I went
Bitmin,he was like oh yeah so I'm pretty sure one of the girls likes me so i was basically the wingman
Bitmin,Yoda noises intensify
Bitmin,I was walking in to the movies with him and the girl that liked him and she asked if I thought one of her friends was cute and I didn't wanna be rude and be like nah
Bitmin,and I mean she kinda was
Bitmin,so I was like yeah I guess
Bitmin,and she was like oh well she thinks you're cute too
Bitmin,and its funny cause I knew this girl when I went to school with her and we hadn't really talked a whole lot but now that i don't go there anymore she thinks I'm cute? okay then
Bitmin,jed is only cute when you don't see him everyday
Bitmin,but basically the rest of the time was them trying to get us together but I wasn't really tryna mess around
Bitmin,also side note truth or dare is the worst movie of 2018
Bitmin,but I was a successful wingman 
Bitmin,"That feeling is called ""saudade"". It's a word only existant in portuguese, it is ""the wistful longing for something you no longer have""."
Bitmin,i think
Bitmin,dont quote me
Bitmin,lmao
Bitmin,I almost sent it though but I think the only reason I didn't is cause I asked a girl out earlier that day and the response was a maybe but leaning towards yes
Bitmin,so friday was a weird day for me
Bitmin,What the heck man
Bitmin,Jed gettin all kinds of ladies
Bitmin,Fellas is it gay to date a lady?
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,I mean you are literally going out with someone who sucks dick
Bitmin,    
Bitmin,Yo
Bitmin,This guy fucks
Bitmin,Not anymore tho because that shit is gay
Bitmin,yo this guy

Bitmin,@Rivals of Aether lets do a tournament sometime 
Bitmin,@Trapezoider check your snap
Bitmin,Can someone help me with a thing on transformations of graphs
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Like I don't get what they want
Bitmin,g(x)=-7f(x) or f(x)=-7g(x) I would think
Bitmin,My problems are usually not in terms of f(x) and g(x) so I'm not sure which one goes where
Bitmin,but reflecting a graph makes the function negative
Bitmin,and stretching by a factor of 7 means multiply by 7
Bitmin,Can you show the functions represented by f(x) and g(x)?
Bitmin,Just tryna figure out where to input that information
Bitmin,No they don't show me the graphs :(
Bitmin,Did my suggestion not work?
Bitmin,I'm going to bed now but good luck.
Bitmin,@Trapezoider whenever you get a chance to look at it I shared it with you so just put comments where you have them
Bitmin,You don't need to know what f(x) or g(x) are
Bitmin,I don't remember exactly how it works but I'm pretty sure you want something like g(x) = -f(1/7 x)
Bitmin,cause the negative gives you the vertical flip and the 1/7 x gives you the horizontal stretch
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,Yes they worked
Bitmin,boo in my high school we wouldn't have gotten marks for cheesing a horizontal stretch as a vertical one
Bitmin,My dad shutoff my fucking internet
Bitmin,riiiiip
Bitmin,Fuck that guy
Bitmin,I'm 17 and you tryna give me a bed time

Bitmin,"so I got up at 1030, rushed out to a review session, didn't eat at all until 430"

Bitmin,and nose
Bitmin,doc are you gonna be back in frostbite now that exams are over?
Bitmin,I've been here all week 
Bitmin,I havent seen you 
Bitmin,I just wasn't in the mood for any csgo
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Are you still planning on attending to meetup?
Bitmin,i miss you dad
Bitmin,"i got those airline tickets and ZACK
 is getting busfare soon"
Bitmin,*zack
Bitmin,fuck
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,Nice
Bitmin,My parents would like to know if you buy tickets
Bitmin,I buy not tickets yet
Bitmin,Nice
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,Did you even read what Max said @Trapezoider
Bitmin,I was mocking him
Bitmin,wait what did he say
Bitmin,Did he fix it
Bitmin,it doesnt say edited
Bitmin,Hello
Bitmin,If I say my message aloud it sounds perfectly fine
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,tense is a bit weird
Bitmin,My parents
Bitmin,"should be bought tickets, not buy tickets"
Bitmin,you can't read that and say that it was fine
Bitmin,Woud like to know
Bitmin,If you buy tickets
Bitmin,"but I know he has not yet, hence bought doesn't work"
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,because he hasnt yet
Bitmin,So they would like to know when he has
Bitmin,ok it could also be will buy
Bitmin,no it is do buy
Bitmin,using present tense doesn't work unless you're asking if that's what he is doing right now
Bitmin,or what he does in general
Bitmin,Holy fuck
Bitmin,Stop
Bitmin,"What do you for a living?
I buy tickets"
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,Have you bought tickets?
Bitmin,he was talking future tense
Bitmin,"""My parents would like to know if you buy tickets (some time in the future)"""
Bitmin,it makes sense
Bitmin,except that 'you buy' is present tense
Bitmin,its not
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,what is the present tense of 'to buy' then
Bitmin,How about; if you are going to buy tickets
Bitmin,but that isn't what they want to know
Bitmin,yeah they want to know when(if) it happens
Bitmin,then you guys are just asking the wrong question
Bitmin,Then why would you use present tense?
Bitmin,"you should just ask ""are you going to buy tickets"""
Bitmin,that isn't the question either
Bitmin,no thats not it
Bitmin,literally don't even care
Bitmin,when are you going to buy tickets
Bitmin,he wanted to know when he buys tickets if he does
Bitmin,tell him after it happens
Bitmin,waezsxrdtcfvygubhnj
Bitmin,"then ask: are you going to buy tickets? if so, when? also, let us know when you do"
Bitmin,because the original question did not communicate that
Bitmin,thats over complicated
Bitmin,it's clear though
Bitmin,I UNDERSTOOD YOU GUYS ARE DUM B
Bitmin,THATS SOUNDS SO FORMAL
Bitmin,"Try it like this ""My parents would like to know if you die"""
Bitmin,same thing different words
Bitmin,The first question you asked did not communicate any of that information
Bitmin,it totally did
Bitmin,yeah but that's not how languages work because language is dumb
Bitmin,most verbs having to do with the state of a person have slightly different rules
Bitmin,I'm going to delete the message and leave this server if you guys don't shut up
Bitmin,it matters so little
Bitmin,omg
Bitmin,calm down
Bitmin,you understood what I meant
Bitmin,we didn't though
Bitmin,the end result would be that doctor would alert me if he purchased tickets
Bitmin,mission accomplished
Bitmin,*shrugs* 'spose
Bitmin,side question: am I alone in enjoying breaking down language and weird specifics of stuff? or is it just that I spent enough time having stuff beaten into my head while learning french that I've developed stockholm syndrome?
Bitmin,I find it to be very boring
Bitmin,It can be sometimes interesting
Bitmin,like in what just happened
Bitmin,I like comparing languages but being a grammar nazi isn't fun
Bitmin,I think it's neat

Bitmin,gonna head to bed soon
Bitmin,Is there an equation to calculate someone's response to a question
Bitmin,Pls
Bitmin,What does that even mean? @Trapezoider
Bitmin,Huh
Bitmin,Oh wow I actually wrote that
Bitmin,I thought that was part of the dream
Bitmin,Huh
Bitmin,Don't worry about it brother
Bitmin,haha what 
Bitmin,I had a dream I was messaging you guys in discord last night while trying to make an important life decision
Bitmin,Turns out I actually messaged you because I wasn't asleep yet :(
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I'm glad I fell asleep before the dream happened :) shit got real
Bitmin,This is so confusing
Bitmin,what was the decision?
Bitmin,Weather or not to do it to em boys
Bitmin,
Bitmin,How else would the dream had happened? Dreams only happen when you sleep.
Bitmin,That's untrue
Bitmin,Not if you're on drugs
Bitmin,I guess when you space out
Bitmin,Ever heard of daydreaming
Bitmin,but you're technically not asleep
Bitmin,...that's the point
Bitmin,"even if you daydream, you're not alseep, so you're not technically dreaming. You're actually deep in thought"
Bitmin,"yes, but your brain patterns 'n stuff are often closer to when you're falling asleep than when you're awake"
Bitmin,it's kind of an in-between state
Bitmin,take it from me who day dreams alot and has had some pretty messed up dreams in my life.
Bitmin,"BTW, while we're on the subject, have any of you guys tried to Lucid Dream?"
Bitmin,never actively tried but it happens every now and then
Bitmin,I am trying to master it so I can work during the night
Bitmin,I have. It's BEYOND trippy!
Bitmin,If I can lucid dream I can practice piano while I sleep etc
Bitmin,Even though I actually didn't try. My mind wouldn't settle down for some reason.
Bitmin,"Towards the end I actually got a little scared cause I was like, ""How do I wake up?!"""
Bitmin,Are you sure practicing piano in a dream would translate to real life??
Bitmin,Just form a cliff
Bitmin,Then jump off
Bitmin,weirdly it actually would
Bitmin,wild
Bitmin,cause you're training all the same bits of your brain that are holding the muscle memory
Bitmin,I think it would work
Bitmin,same patterns of brain activation
Bitmin,"I've heard if you die in a dream, there's a chance you could die in real life. Not know how true that is tho"
Bitmin,"probably not as well, but it could help"
Bitmin,also no that's 100% bullshit
Bitmin,thats not true
Bitmin,That's what I thought
Bitmin,well technically you could but it's the same chance as dying at any other point of your life
Bitmin,you're stupid
Bitmin,"Well maybe something could happen to your brain if you die in a dream, but that might not be true either."
Bitmin,You're brain doesn't function that way
Bitmin,It would have to produce a neurotransmitter which is toxic and produce it in high enough doses
Bitmin,"Well sorry, I'm not an expert on the brain functions!"
Bitmin,But the brain doesn't and wouldn't do that
Bitmin,wow neurotransmitter! That's a big word for you 
Bitmin,the placebo effect is strong but we're damn good at not tricking ourselves into dying
Bitmin,^^^
Bitmin,maybe it is for you but not for him
Bitmin,not everyone's retarded
Bitmin,"true... but I'm not, neither is he or you"
Bitmin,I don't know. None of us know you well enough to confirm or deny that. Except max and Ava 
Bitmin,that emoji makes me want to die

Bitmin,he picked me up cause apperently I beat a Kragg who is supposedly good
Bitmin,so I'm reading a javascript textbook
Bitmin,"""Every now and then, usually between eight and ten in the evening, Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail."""
Bitmin,what
Bitmin,"later on in the same chapter,

""For a few years, things go great for Jacques. But at some point he loses his job. Because he lives in a nasty country where having no job means having no medical services, he is forced to take employment with a circus where he performs as The Incredible Squirrelman, stuffing his mouth with peanut butter before every show.

One day, fed up with this pitiful existence, Jacques fails to change back into his human form, hops through a crack in the circus tent, and vanishes into the forest. He is never seen again."""
Bitmin,Why would this be in a java textbook?
Bitmin,Yeah what the hell
Bitmin,it was to set up the premise for data for a series of examples
Bitmin,"also, javascript, not java"
Bitmin,different languages
Bitmin,Would that make this any less weird?

Bitmin,wait why do you need to learn js reat dedux
Bitmin,redux
Bitmin,he wants me to make a website with it
Bitmin,and technically he's my boss
Bitmin,so that's what I'm doing
Bitmin,wait so you got an internship with your brother as your boss lol
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,"nepotism, bitch"
Bitmin,wait so how are you planning to learn it react is pretty small but an not sure about redux
Bitmin,tons of massive ass tutorials
Bitmin,practice
Bitmin,what was that game
Bitmin,n0ne is a lunatic
Bitmin,that was way closer than it had any right to be
Bitmin,if he hadn't thrown away that ganon stock he could have won that
Bitmin,that recovery vs scorp tho
Bitmin,yeah that was unbelievable
Bitmin,was actually insane
Bitmin,I've never seen falcon recovery like that
Bitmin,imo n0ne is best at falcon recovery
Bitmin,god n0ne is the fucking best
Bitmin,wizzy is best at everything else
Bitmin,but sucks at recovery
Bitmin,s2j is just bad
Bitmin,s2j's ok at everything
Bitmin,he's the middle ground falcon

Bitmin,@Bitmin
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,zack I asked her to go ice skating
Bitmin,This is the moment of truth Br0THER
Bitmin,did you ask her over text
Bitmin,I asked her on our run this morning when  she came over
Bitmin,and she said
Bitmin,She would consult other tentative plans. And would provide and answer around this time. Lookin like a fat no
Bitmin,"also, you guys have indoor rinks? didn't occur to me that the states would have that"
Bitmin,Hell yeah. There are like 2 nearby ish
Bitmin,r
Bitmin,i
Bitmin,p
Bitmin,F
Bitmin,F
Bitmin,"@Trapezoider  most likely if she said she'd concult plans it means she's not interested. (Or maybe she is, but most likely not...)"
Bitmin,or maybe she just doesn't like skating
Bitmin,we gotta stay optimistic
Bitmin,I'm with Zack
Bitmin,I guess...
Bitmin,I feel like skating isn't all that popular in the states
Bitmin,I tried ice skating this one time and I sucked at it.
Bitmin,fell on my butt like 20 times
Bitmin,yeah that's skating at first
Bitmin,still easier than snowboarding
Bitmin,first time I tried I spent more time on the ground than on my feet
Bitmin,but in general skating ignores a lot of the things you instinctively do to stay balanced
Bitmin,cause you can't brace yourself except sideways
Bitmin,that was the same with me. The only time I was actually standing was when I was hugging the wall.
Bitmin,skating takes time
Bitmin,only reason I'm any good is cause canada
Bitmin,lots of practice
Bitmin,Though I'd much rather roll skate than ice skate.
Bitmin,shudders
Bitmin,I don't like how hard it is to stop on roller skates
Bitmin,"stopping on roller skates is tough, but you can at least STAND on them."
Bitmin,it's a skill on skates -_-
Bitmin,its something you have to learn
Bitmin,but at least I know that if I'm out of control I can stop quickly

Bitmin,
Bitmin,dude wtf you guys doing lol
Bitmin,I just watched the end of the last mafia and chillin threw so hard
Bitmin,he had it in the bag
Bitmin,and he fucked up right at the end
Bitmin,"also this is getting me to want to try some mafia, who'd be down to play?"
Bitmin,me
Bitmin,As am I
Bitmin,how many people do we need to get a proper game going?
Bitmin,I think somewhere in the realm of 12-14
Bitmin,"google says you need at least 7, 2 mafia vs 5 town"
Bitmin,today won't work for me though because I have 3 finals tomorrow
Bitmin,I think 2 vs 5 is for speed mafia without the medic cop and vigilante
Bitmin,I can't for the next 12 days
Bitmin,I mean I think you need some town roles
Bitmin,I feel like doing 2 mafia 4 town 1 cop would be best
Bitmin,Yo what about the doctor tho
Bitmin,eh less important imo
Bitmin,Let's do it when Chris gets back
Bitmin,Astralis got 3-0'd last night :(

Bitmin,theoretically
Bitmin,zain could win this
Bitmin,he's beaten m2k
Bitmin,and if leffen makes it through he could
Bitmin,personally I'm hoping for m2k leffen grands
Bitmin,I don't think Zain has ever beaten m2k
Bitmin,didn't he in pools? or was that 3-2 m2k
Bitmin,m2k won 3-2
Bitmin,and he won every game in the marth ditto and 3-0ed him in a marth ditto a few tourneys ago
Bitmin,ah that's probably gonna be m2k's win then

Bitmin,@everyone I have created a fun poll that I would like some people to take. https://goo.gl/forms/8zLaUC56G04V6EsF2
Bitmin,Who in Frostbite?
Bitmin,"In this poll I will find out what the members of frostbite think about each other. I will only be including master memers as options, sorry in advance but I don't want to have too many choices."
Bitmin,Submitted
Bitmin,Should have been anonymous though
Bitmin,the name was optional
Bitmin,so it can be anonymous if you want
Bitmin,I have reason to believe someone is spamming multiple responses
Bitmin,Please don't ruin my poll
Bitmin,I only did one
Bitmin,Jed did it too
Bitmin,One of you did more than 1
Bitmin,nah I did polygon and thats it

Bitmin,I am currently doing mine
Bitmin,mine was under my name
Bitmin,"I may remake it later, require authentication, and only PM it to master memers"
Bitmin,just delete the spam results
Bitmin,I'm not sure if they are spam though
Bitmin,someone may have just used a dumb name and responded almost exactly like another person
Bitmin,can we access poll results soon?
Bitmin,soon

Bitmin,possibly not tonight
Bitmin,probably not tonight
Bitmin,yo I took a game off of one of the top 10 rivals players

Bitmin,alright
Bitmin,let me go get my controller cable and refil my coffee
Bitmin,5 mins
Bitmin,andrew did you lean any combos?
Bitmin,"if not, max should probably play not his main"
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,buy your texas tickets big gay
Bitmin,!zack
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,how do you break out of combos
Bitmin,This game is hard
Bitmin,@everyone
Bitmin,Let's have a skill girls tournament on Saturday
Bitmin,I mean you don't break out of combos
Bitmin,but if you see this weird smoke stuff you can hit any button to burst
Bitmin,but htat only happens if the other person repeats the same thing too many times in the same combo
Bitmin,"and if me or max is comboing you, we've learned combos that don't let you break out"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"but generally, it's not optimal to do the full combo unless it's gonna kill"
Bitmin,cause the longer the combo the less any individual hit does
Bitmin,"you ideally want to combo someone a bit, then trick them and start a new combo with fresh damage scaling"
Bitmin,but neither me nor max is good enough to do that yet
Bitmin,"also, max, did you go fukua against him? that wasn't very nice of you lol"
Bitmin,I only remember half the combo
Bitmin,I know next to nothing about any other character and didn't feel like figuring it out
Bitmin,@Trapezoider I'll be down for games in like an hour and a half
Bitmin,Hell yeah
Bitmin,Going to the gym will play games when I return

Bitmin,"Like a salmon, I have returned to the land of my birth"
Bitmin,"hopefully, unlike a salmon, I will be neither dying nor mating here"
Bitmin,"also, the nearest in & out is an hour and a half walk away and I'm salty"
Bitmin,I might do it anyway
Bitmin,Welcome to America!
Bitmin,guys your roads are so nice
Bitmin,True
Bitmin,"If you come to the meetup you can see the widest highway in the entire world. The Katy Freeway, which is something like 16 lanes."
Bitmin,Depends where tho
Bitmin,"I mean it's more just like, they're hella smooth"
Bitmin,cause there aren't proper winters here
Bitmin,so you don't get tons of potholes
Bitmin,I'm not used to this
Bitmin,Warm climate>cold climate
Bitmin,"on the flip side, it's about a million degrees in my room"
Bitmin,and there's no AC
Bitmin,lemme add 'fan' to my shopping list
Bitmin,good idea
Bitmin,"once I unpacked my computer, the first thing I looked up was the nearest in and out, and the second thing was making sure the tap water is drinkable"
Bitmin,"priorities, motherfuckers"
Bitmin,"tap water: safe to drink
tap water: tastes kinda bad"
Bitmin,"also, your paper money sucks"
Bitmin,Yes

Bitmin,as seen on the (pretty much dead) norcal melee discord
Bitmin,"@ americans, is jack in the box any good? I'm trying to find fast food within walking distance"
Bitmin,my next best option is kfc
Bitmin,Its decent
Bitmin,is kfc a better bet?
Bitmin,they're both meh imo
Bitmin,but which one is more meh
Bitmin,I think it depends on if you want burger or chicken
Bitmin,choose based on that
Bitmin,I mean I don't really care one way or the other?
Bitmin,dammit I'm trying to get you guys to make up my mind
Bitmin,choose jack in the box
Bitmin,
Bitmin,AAAAAAH I JUST CHECK MY INTERNET
Bitmin,178 mb/s down
Bitmin,hot damn
Bitmin,that's like ten times what I was getting at home
Bitmin,only 6 mb/s up though
Bitmin,which is actually lower
Bitmin,UP usually will be variable so it changes pretty frequently
Bitmin,Prolly kfc
Bitmin,ZACK I JUST REALIZED WE CAN PLAY MELEE ALL THE TIME BUDDY IM CRYI G
Bitmin,OUR PING IS GOING TO BE SO FUCKING GOOD 
Bitmin,Oh true
Bitmin,Can't use the ping excuse anymore 
Bitmin,I'm Playing @Cs:go
Bitmin,so I ended up at kfc
Bitmin,"was gonna do jack in the box, but I accidentally turned right instead of left and ended up at kfc"
Bitmin,and decided it was probably fate
Bitmin,and now I can feel like I've lived the american dream
Bitmin,of getting shitty service in a basically empty kfc
Bitmin,?

Bitmin,My history teacher is retarded and we have to color and label a map of every country
Bitmin,Every country in the entire world?
Bitmin,This has nothing to do with history
Bitmin,Yes all 206 or whatever
Bitmin,wow
Bitmin,He is just a horrible teacher who doesn't want to teach or grade anything
Bitmin,At least you didn't have to put a certain number of dots on each country based off it's population
Bitmin,That was fun
Bitmin,Damn
Bitmin,Oh Christ
Bitmin,Why is the education system so retarded
Bitmin,Nah it's just this teacher really
Bitmin,But I mean yeah
Bitmin,He doesn't even give tests it's always projects
Bitmin,Because we don't learn anything
Bitmin,good ol education system
Bitmin,But I go to a private school so one would expect that it'd be better but no

Bitmin,@Homies do you guys wanna have a melee tournament where Zack and max can't play their mains or secondaries?
Bitmin,I'm down
Bitmin,I guess so
Bitmin,"Honestly, depending on skill level, you may need to ban 15+ characters"
Bitmin,for us
Bitmin,we could do it like we used to do rivals tournaments
Bitmin,we should do it like rivals where each person gets a certain number of bans
Bitmin,based on skill
Bitmin,great minds think alike
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,maybe I could even rope in Ava for one more
Bitmin,lets try and do it tonight
Bitmin,so do we have 4 so far?
Bitmin,we could maybe get up to 6
Bitmin,I'm curious what my ping's gonna be like to everyone
Bitmin,I think we'll have to except that some people will have awful ping
Bitmin,I'll have great ping to andrew for once
Bitmin,I have fine ping to the shapes so we should be okay
Bitmin,and jed
Bitmin,"also, do you want to play a bit in like an hour? I want to get a little more done but then I want a break"
Bitmin,I'm down

Bitmin,"alternatively, 792eddbc"
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Was getting water
Bitmin,@Melee I dont really think its worth me playing in this thing since ima have crappy ping with pretty much everyone
Bitmin,I'm still in Florida until next week so count me out

Bitmin,@cs 1 game ?
Bitmin,@Zain  ?>
Bitmin,@Max is thing happen tonight?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,Jed isn't here
Bitmin,"@Sak von Sak  Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you been watching the Persona 5 Animation? If you are, how are you enjoying it?"
Bitmin,it's.... mediocre
Bitmin,it gets the broad strokes
Bitmin,but the pacing's wack
Bitmin,really?
Bitmin,and it's skipped a lot of little important character moments
Bitmin,it's missing a lot of the charm the game had
Bitmin,"Well I mean, trying to crame moments into a 30 minute episode and 24 of them, I can see how the pacing can be off."
Bitmin,"I only saw one episode, the battle against Kamoshida (the first boss)."
Bitmin,I mean it's not horrible
Bitmin,but you'd be better off playing the game
Bitmin,my biggest problem is they keep cutting good character building moments
Bitmin,and it's persona
Bitmin,you can't just skip the character building
Bitmin,and the back-and-forth and stuff that builds the characters into a group with dynamics and stuff rather than just a bunch of characters shoved together
Bitmin,"also the protag is both a) bland as fuck, and b) practically non-existant as a character"
Bitmin,"I know they're running him from a silent protagonist in the game, but even in-game they gave him a lot more character than this"
Bitmin,"like, watch the p4 anime if you want to see a persona protag handled well"
Bitmin,"or even the p3 movies, although he's kind of an emo little shit, but at least that's actually a personality"

Bitmin,Also more for what
Bitmin,Meetup
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Hey it's like frostbites 3 years anniversary
Bitmin,Ah
Bitmin,how do you know
Bitmin,Because I met you guys for the tf2 team 3 years ago
Bitmin,frostbite is a bit older than you knowing them is
Bitmin,frostbite was actually a bit later
Bitmin,but the core group was earlier
Bitmin,I wasn't even part of the original core group
Bitmin,the original team where we all met was called frostbite
Bitmin,thats where the name came from
Bitmin,I joined like... two and a half years ago?
Bitmin,oh huh
Bitmin,"so it was frostbite, then not frostbite, then frostbite again?"
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,Frostbite>Pancake Pals>POOP>Rolo Regiment>Frostbite
Bitmin,I've known you guys for 3 years is what I was saying
Bitmin,It's my anniversary of knowing you guys
Bitmin,POOP?
Bitmin,POOP
Bitmin,is that an acronym?
Bitmin,People Order Our Patties
Bitmin,o h
Bitmin,I voted against it
Bitmin,its funny
Bitmin,that team was made of spongebob references
Bitmin,Man we've had a lot of good times
Bitmin,RIP frostbite gamers
Bitmin,"unrelated, but I had a dream last night that my friend (in the dream, now that I'm awake I have no idea who he was) got turned into a giant monster cause he fell into a pool of red bull and the army was after him so me and some other people took him and ran away to australia where we just kinda chilled in a hotel room and threw cookies at each other"
Bitmin,"also unrelated, to both the previous conversation and my previous thing, I found the best twitter: it's a bot that scrapes github for people committing stuff with swearing in it and posts them. It scratches two great itches of 1) relating to salty programmers, and 2) hilarious mixing of professional, technical writing with swearing"
Bitmin,for example: https://twitter.com/gitlost/status/996784597194170369
Bitmin,I MADE THIS SHIT TO WORK ASYNCHRONOUSLY WITH SMALL DELAYS
Bitmin,Make a film off of that dream please

Bitmin,The first frostbite discord post
Bitmin,Actually I feel like that's wrong my discord might be lying to me
Bitmin,Holy crap
Bitmin,My guy how long did you scroll
Bitmin,Lol
Bitmin,Remember when we used mumble
Bitmin,Doctors mumble server
Bitmin,No it was kamerons
Bitmin,:0
Bitmin,Cause it was mumble tf2
Bitmin,my first tf2 team still has a facebook page and it's mad nostalgic
Bitmin,
Bitmin,am just an overwatch scrub lol
Bitmin,I'm scrolling back through now and I found the best picture I've ever taken
Bitmin,Yo everyone keep sending old screenshots on getting so much nostalgia
Bitmin,
Bitmin,This is the beginning of my server
Bitmin,what about the OG frostbite?
Bitmin,I left that server :0
Bitmin,Why
Bitmin,@Bitmin
Bitmin,esea
Bitmin,im only back now and a bit later
Bitmin,That was a good nostalgia trip
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Man I remember mumble
Bitmin,I honestly dont really remember mumble
Bitmin,discord is so much better
Bitmin,I remember I hated discord whnr it came out
Bitmin,Mumbles interface was terrible
Bitmin,Discord is a huge step up
Bitmin,I don't know how we used it for so long
Bitmin,"If we've known Trap for 3 years, does that mean we've known each other for 4? @Max @Mr. Airplane"
Bitmin,"no, its been 3 years for us"
Bitmin,around 2 and a half for him
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,September 25 is the earliest thing I can find in Monday night super slammed whatever
Bitmin,Of 2015
Bitmin,Kameron Chris and I were on a team before that
Bitmin,it formed in May 2015
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I joined early 2016 if I remember correctly
Bitmin,Chikon nd the cock fighters right
Bitmin,Or rolo regiment
Bitmin,Right?
Bitmin,rolo regiment
Bitmin,not even the weirdest team name I've played for
Bitmin,that probably goes to 'It's Raining Minh'
Bitmin,HA
Bitmin,Was the leader Chinese?
Bitmin,not even
Bitmin,the story goes a little like this:
Bitmin,"there was a team, with some normal name"
Bitmin,their medic was this guy who went by minh
Bitmin,and they had some weird in-joke about 'minh advantage'
Bitmin,"eventually, said team disbanded, and a few people got together to make a new team, which was called minh advantage"
Bitmin,"that team also broke up, and a new subset of that team, containing a few people from the original team whose name I don't remember, made another new team, minh advantage II"
Bitmin,which is when I joined
Bitmin,"then there was some upheaval with a patch that messed with demo and heavy a bit and like, half the team quit"
Bitmin,"it was then patched up with some teammates from my first tf2 team and some tryouts, and rechristened It's Raining Minh"
Bitmin,and we went on to make playoffs
Bitmin,and then disband
Bitmin,You should make a movie out of that
Bitmin,I'm now wondering if some people from it's raining minh went on to make another team with a name containing minh
Bitmin,"also, as It's Raining Minh our team tag was a little umbrella that is for some reason an accepted unicode character"
Bitmin,@Melee anyone want to play for a bit?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,I can't talk tho
Bitmin,k
Bitmin,@Melee I am unsatiated

Bitmin,@Bitmin wanna csgo?
Bitmin,Oh jeez I have not slept in a couple day but I'll play 1 game give me a couple mins
Bitmin,oh ok
Bitmin,pfffft yeah
Bitmin,it's a meme
Bitmin,that you probably won't experience in the show
Bitmin,"but basically at the end of days in-game, sometimes based on events during the day you can't go out or anything, but the game still gives you some control over your character"
Bitmin,but if you try to leave
Bitmin,Morgana: You look tired. You should get some sleep.
Bitmin,it's an integral part of the p5 experience

Bitmin,so my hero academia is a good show
Bitmin,nice
Bitmin,"I won't deny that, it's just personally doesn't appeal to me."
Bitmin,yee that show's awesome
Bitmin,how far in are you?
Bitmin,4 episodes
Bitmin,I watched it this morning
Bitmin,I may be sleep deprived but I teared up a little bit 
Bitmin,I think I'm gay 
Bitmin,Crying as a man doesn't mean you're gay
Bitmin,but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
Bitmin,
Bitmin,who said I'm gay?
Bitmin,literally nobody
Bitmin,^ we were talking about me
Bitmin,"well when he said
but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
after my comment, I thought he was talking about me"
Bitmin,Nah he's saying I'm gay
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"well like I said, crying as a man doesn't mean your gay."
Bitmin,you are of hte gay andrew
Bitmin,Snap
Bitmin,I thought I liked girls
Bitmin,"In fact, it shows that you're a true man as true men know how to express their feelings"
Bitmin,^^^ true brother
Bitmin,"and besides, you're not gay in my book unless you're making out with dudes."
Bitmin,bruh i feel like you can still make out with dudes and not be gay
Bitmin,aslong as your socks are on
Bitmin,"if you were forced, maybe."
Bitmin,"like if my LIFE or something VERY precious to me was on the line, I'd probably do it. But otherwise, nuh uh!"
Bitmin,Compelled homosexuality
Bitmin,like if some dude came up to me  and offered me $20 to make out with him id probably do it so i see where you're coming from mrd256
Bitmin,"I wouldn't do it for $20, unless I was desperate."
Bitmin,i am
Bitmin,you're broke then
Bitmin,College
Bitmin,"eh, makes sense"
Bitmin,"I could get two extra large pepperoni pizzas for $20

I would give a guy a quick peck on the lips for two extra large pepperoni pizzas, especially in this situation where there's clearly no expectations of anything beyond that. I'm not desperate or broke, I just really like pizza."
Bitmin,with $20 i can buy literally 60 packs of ramen
Bitmin,thats lunch for 2 months
Bitmin,ramen in America is unhealthy you now that.
Bitmin,"like, extremely"
Bitmin,clearly you don't understand university living
Bitmin,it's far more healthy to eat ramen every day for lunch
Bitmin,than to not eat lunch
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,fucking
Bitmin,preach
Bitmin,"Well I'm not in collage or live by my self yet, so maybe it don't."
Bitmin,but the pizzas though
Bitmin,"And while ramen is not good for you, it is better than not eating anything. Doesn't make it healthier tho"
Bitmin,at the end of the day I think it comes down to priorities: there's not much on that level of harmlessness that I wouldn't do for $20
Bitmin,"Listen, $20 is $20"
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,@Cs:go gamezzzzzzzz

Bitmin,"@Zack  So I was playing Persona 5 and I think I noticed an animation error in one of the cutscenes. This is the beach scene. Yusuke holds up his hands like he's trying to picture something in the next shot his hands are like backwards? Thought you might find this interesting.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449728861484220416/unknown.png
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449729119408619551/unknown.png"
Bitmin,lol I never noticed that
Bitmin,probably just a laziness thing
Bitmin,I was probably a little too busy cracking up at the towel thing
Bitmin,"It's just something funny that caught my eye.
Yeah, the towel thing was funny too."
Bitmin,"Tho one of the highlights for me in this scene, was the protagonist actually speaking an actual line. Just based on his battle quotes, I think they choose a great english VA for him, but he doesn't speak enough, even during battle."
Bitmin,"If there is a Persona 5 animation dub, I'd watch it just to hear his VA in full."
Bitmin,Xander Mobus
Bitmin,he's the announcer guy for sm4sh
Bitmin,and they picked him for basically just yelling names again
Bitmin,good pick
Bitmin,honestly the english cast for p5 is all damn good except maybe haru
Bitmin,"yeah, I think his voice fits him."
Bitmin,Haru... eh she's okay.
Bitmin,her voice was annoying at first but it grew on me
Bitmin,that's kinda the way it is will all really high-pitched girls
Bitmin,eh not always
Bitmin,but yeah pretty often
Bitmin,"Honestly, I wasn't too big a fan of Makoto's VA. Not that she was a bad actress, but the fact that her voice didn't really suit her. But that's me"
Bitmin,I am incredibly biased towards her voice actress because she's done a ton of roles I've loved
Bitmin,so I felt like it worked
Bitmin,but that might just be me
Bitmin,But the one VA I like out of them all is Morgana's. Cassandra Morris is one of my most favorite dub voice actresses
Bitmin,She had me terrified
Bitmin,you can't put kyubey's voice in a cutesy animal sidekick
Bitmin,you just can't do that
Bitmin,that's not ok
Bitmin,"Well, I don't really know who Kyubey is... but I like her because of some other roles she's done."
Bitmin,"And Morgana is not a ""Cutesy"" animal sidekick!"
Bitmin,"@ anyone who's watched madoka magica, confirm that you would be scared to hear his voice coming out of any cutesy animal sidekick"
Bitmin,"also, aesthetically, definitely cutesy"
Bitmin,"personality-wise, not as much"
Bitmin,I'll give you that
Bitmin,"also, you've finished p4, right?"
Bitmin,"I didn't play it, but I've watched the anime. But I did finish the anime"
Bitmin,"for p4, I correctly predicted the villain by their voice actor, cause I was like 'there is no way they would hire a voice actor this good at sounding badass and evil and give him to that derpy a character.'"
Bitmin,so I was never not suspicious of morgana
Bitmin,I'm not telling you if I was right or not
Bitmin,but I was scared from start to finish
Bitmin,"Most of the roles I know Morgana's VA from are all protagonist characters or sub characters. Nothing evil about them. Also, she was in p4's anime"
Bitmin,p4 had the weirdest voice cast
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane show us your graduation pics or it's fake
Bitmin,"50% amazing, 50% terrible"
Bitmin,"Yeah, the only VAs I liked in p4 were Yu, Yosuke, Kanji, and Rise"
Bitmin,that would pretty much be their big-name voice actors in the main cast
Bitmin,yep
Bitmin,"Johnny Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker/Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey"
Bitmin,and then a bunch of mediocre people
Bitmin,and then some big names for tiny roles
Bitmin,that pretty much sums it up
Bitmin,"p5 has the best overall cast, p3 had a solid one with a few big problems"
Bitmin,it starts off so strong
Bitmin,"Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Vic Mignogna, Tara Platt, Liam O'Brian"
Bitmin,and then Fuuka shows up
Bitmin,heh
Bitmin,I didn't know Michelle Ruff and Liam O'Brian were in p3. Did Michelle voice Yukari?
Bitmin,"yeah, and Liam O'Brian did Akihiko"
Bitmin,Ah! I was thinking Akihiko was Josh Grelle.
Bitmin,"and Yukari is possibly my favorite Persona girl so far.
and my favorite Persona character period is possibly Akechi from p5"
Bitmin,"I Really like that sadistic and psychotic type of villian, especially where they look so innocent to begin with."
Bitmin,I always kinda figured he was gonna turn out evil
Bitmin,I just didn't realize... how evil
Bitmin,when he snaps he snaps
Bitmin,and his voice actor does an amazing job of it too
Bitmin,"He was like one of the main antagonists, next to Shido and the final boss"
Bitmin,yeah he does
Bitmin,and he was definitely the most interesting antagonist
Bitmin,true that

Bitmin,Sorry about to play a game of civ 5
Bitmin,training session?
Bitmin,DO YOU MEAN
Bitmin,MELEE
Bitmin,ill play
Bitmin,melee isnt fun with such high ping because high ping buffs you as a player and nerfs me. I will fight you when I am in texas and our ping is better
Bitmin,honestly high ping usually hurts the stronger player
Bitmin,"you can't combo as hard, or be as precise in neutral"
Bitmin,"no johns, andrew"
Bitmin,@Trapezoider Civ game isn't happening I can play now
Bitmin,youre wrong in this case zack
Bitmin,Kameron has no movement ability and little tech skill
Bitmin,he still has combos and neutral
Bitmin,My playstyle revolves around getting grabs and spacing around my opponent
Bitmin,which are far more affected
Bitmin,When I have 120 ping
Bitmin,"@Sak von Sak When your entire punish game is being good at tech chasing, high ping hurts a lot"
Bitmin,wavedashing because impossible
Bitmin,I guess
Bitmin,which is the case for trap
Bitmin,"also wavedashing and most tech is muscle memory, ping shouldn't matter"
Bitmin,It does matter because it changes the timing
Bitmin,Milliseconds matter
Bitmin,"a wavedash is the same input, you just have to do it ever so slightly earlier"
Bitmin,no different than any other input

Bitmin,@everyone Do we wanna do competitive teams or all work together tonight?
Bitmin,Im buying the realm after the sony conference is over
Bitmin,pvp
Bitmin,"I say we do it kinda like the hunger games but with teams. So everyone gets a certain set of items to start and we have a period of invincibility. After that time, we have to survive as teams and also try to kill the other team."
Bitmin,I don't want to have it be a communist society type thing but I'm really not into the killing and looting thing
Bitmin,@everyone
Bitmin,DM usernames now
Bitmin,Sadly I am in class so I can not watching it with you guys 
Bitmin,The realm is starting after the sony conference
Bitmin,Sony was supposed to be at 6 but they weren’t ready lol
Bitmin,no worries
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,@Eric Working From Home
Bitmin,Can you guys dm usernames?
Bitmin,Want to join the minecraft thing tonight?
Bitmin,We are starting a new realm
Bitmin,I'll join
Bitmin,Awesome
Bitmin,@Trapezoider We may have to use an external tool to find a seed that doesn't have an ocean anywhere near spawn.
Bitmin,A team that spawned in the ocean would be pretty much done for
Bitmin,what is the race this time btw?
Bitmin,"This isn't a race, its PVP to the last man"
Bitmin,oh k cool
Bitmin,teams or FFA?
Bitmin,Our goal is to start after the Sony e3 show
Bitmin,teams FFA is the plan
Bitmin,2v2v2v2v2 type fo deal?
Bitmin,It would be awesome if we could get that many teams
Bitmin,50 50 split would be more fun imo
Bitmin,nah
Bitmin,We shall vote
Bitmin,then it would all end in 1 fight
Bitmin,good point
Bitmin,"with smaller teams, the fights will be more spread out"
Bitmin,but if someone dies super early thats so lame
Bitmin,and 2v1 comebacks are much more possible than like 2v6
Bitmin,They can spectate
Bitmin,pvp gives me depression
Bitmin,that's sometimes almost as fun as playing
Bitmin,no it aint
Bitmin,We will be having a grace period
Bitmin,everyone will be safe for some amount of time
Bitmin,trap team with me pls
Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,@Trapezoider I'll need to go over some standard rules to prevent stalling before we play
Bitmin,ye youre my team
Bitmin,aavaaa
Bitmin,Max make the rules and put them in the Realm channel
Bitmin,someone stop letting max make the rules
Bitmin,no mining?
Bitmin,tf?
Bitmin,These are standard rules
Bitmin,without them it is impossible to find anyone
Bitmin,no Branch minding Devin!
Bitmin,All major UHC games follow that rule
Bitmin,wow you're supposed to be my main man matt but you dont even know how to spell my name
Bitmin,"first of all, I'm not your bud.
second, is it Kevin or Devin? you keep changing it"
Bitmin,first of all
Bitmin,i am your bud
Bitmin,second of all
Bitmin,kevin is my persona my irl name has always been Devon
Bitmin,no one likes u kevn
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"@Max  I say Nether should be allowed, but only for Blaze Rods."
Bitmin,also... I'm not sure about enchanting
Bitmin,The point of banning the nether is so you can't hide in it
Bitmin,agree no nether
Bitmin,hmm that's a good point.
Bitmin,I would like no enchanting
Bitmin,"Also, is this team based or no?"
Bitmin,@Trapezoider hey fucker
Bitmin,"The reason for the nether, diamond, and enchantment bans is to try and speed up the game by vastly reducing the amount of time people need to spend gathering resources."
Bitmin,"Not sure if everyone wants this, but I think it would be more fun."
Bitmin,is this team based or no?
Bitmin,We are planning on having teams
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,I say we have a grace period until the end of the first Minecraft day
Bitmin,day or day and night?
Bitmin,from sunrise Day 1 to sunrise day 2
Bitmin,day and night
Bitmin,I mean we could always just go off of the honour system to not hide
Bitmin,there are some people on here I don't trust to do that
Bitmin,Also we could say that after x amount of time we get teleported to spawn to finish so it doesn't last forever
Bitmin,"Even with no hiding, by banning these things we will reduce the amount of time needed to acquire maximum strength gear"
Bitmin,I trust everyone here
Bitmin,points to Devin
Bitmin,"That is my main reason, not to prevent hiding."
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,why did you hey fucker
Bitmin,Whats up
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,can you take a break to join for the realms thing big guy?
Bitmin,in like an hour
Bitmin,I don't think he owns Minecraft
Bitmin,really? I thought he was there last time we made a realm
Bitmin,"I mean, I don't think banning things like diamonds and the nether are gonna be fun. I think you should be able to use whatever you find"
Bitmin,at least allow diamonds
Bitmin,We can discuss this in detail when we decide the final rules later.
Bitmin,but then ppl will spend forever looking for them and thats boring
Bitmin,^^^^
Bitmin,"also, if we're doing custom terrain, we can lower diamond spawn rates making it harder to get them"
Bitmin,That would lead to even more time farming though
Bitmin,Not if you can't strip mine. People will have to leave their caves eventually
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I'm not for lowering the rates of ores
Bitmin,Kinda lame
Bitmin,only diamond
Bitmin,just diamonds
Bitmin,Still
Bitmin,If anything make them more common
Bitmin,Lowering diamonds makes others more common?
Bitmin,"No, I mean make diamonds more common so you don't have to spend as long searching for them."
Bitmin,but then everyone will have diamond gear
Bitmin,so?
Bitmin,well I guess that's fair kinda fair...
Bitmin,makes fights last longer
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,We could also give everyone 20 hearts with commands
Bitmin,You guys want that?
Bitmin,I like that
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,Keep figuring this out and tell me what to do when we start
Bitmin,Are we gonna have a world border?
Bitmin,of course
Bitmin,Can we do a shrinking border then?
Bitmin,are we playing on the latest snap shot or 1.12?
Bitmin,"@Trapezoider If you want this to go more smoothly, be sure to make me an OP on your new server"
Bitmin,"can we make a rule that if someone dies randomly from falling they can come back to life, I feel like that is going to happen and it will be super lame"
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,That won't happen
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,it might
Bitmin,Just don't die from fall damage
Bitmin,Easy
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,its no t
Bitmin,just watch what you're doing at all times
Bitmin,>.>
Bitmin,I'm planning on having health regen on by the way
Bitmin,Survival of the fittest mother fucker
Bitmin,Having it off penalizes you for taking fights
Bitmin,so are we playing in the latest snapshot or 1.12?
Bitmin,I would say 1.12
Bitmin,"well hold on, I want to check if 1.13 is out, I don't think it is... but I want to check"
Bitmin,it is on pre-release
Bitmin,will that do? or still on 1.12?
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,Whatever the realm allows for
Bitmin,what time are we starting?
Bitmin,After the Sony E3 event
Bitmin,not sure when that is
Bitmin,ask Andrew
Bitmin,I'm just going to be here
Bitmin,@Trapezoider  what time is Sony E3 over?
Bitmin,idk
Bitmin,im not watching it
Bitmin,Can you declare a start time then? Otherwise it will be left ambiguous and it will never happen.
Bitmin,Sony ends at 10 ish
Bitmin,What time zone?

Bitmin,Feedback from melee players will hopefully help
Bitmin,well I've lost all interest in this game
Bitmin,knockback looks so wack
Bitmin,you fly super far super fast and then just stop
Bitmin,that's gonna mess with combos pretty hard I'm guessing
Bitmin,"no ledge hog, no wave stuff, same top tier as smash 4, no  dash dance, resident sleeper"
Bitmin,fingers crossed for it improving in the interm
Bitmin,cause they'll probably get a lot of feedback from the competitive people who want some changes
Bitmin,yes and nintendo will TOTALLY listen to that /s
Bitmin,shhh let me live in my happy little bubble
Bitmin,ok sorry
Bitmin,this is pretty cringe
Bitmin,I use that word sparingly
Bitmin,"desk guy: ""everyone's hoping for that 7th map""
the entire chat: ""4-0 pls"""
Bitmin,"If the numbers each character was given in the smash 5 trailer corresponds to the order they were created (which I think they said was the case), then the long held theory of roy and game and watch being created last and being incomplete has finally been confirmed."
Bitmin,2-2 rip
Bitmin,resident sleeper
Bitmin,I'm reading reddit and people seem to think that ledge hogging in a game is bad and I honestly don't understand why
Bitmin,it literally doubles the amount of ways that you can feasibly kill your opponent and thus makes the game more interesting and complex
Bitmin,what's even the point of ledges if they don't do anything?
Bitmin,it begins
Bitmin,@everyone smash invitational starting
Bitmin,Where is it at
Bitmin,https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo
Bitmin,Nintendo - Twitch
Bitmin,Nintendo @ E3: Day 1
Bitmin,lol already we've got mango chants
Bitmin,crowd chanting mango
Bitmin,mango chant
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,we all thought the same thing
Bitmin,were they not allowed to wear their team's jerseys?
Bitmin,prolly not cause it's pure nintendo sponsored
Bitmin,also why is vish's mic so quiet
Bitmin,Vish's mic is broken I think
Bitmin,I think we are hearing auditorium speaker audio through the other people's mics
Bitmin,This better be 1v1s
Bitmin,why wouldnt it be?
Bitmin,oh well nevermind
Bitmin,The smash 4 invitational was 4 player ffa
Bitmin,this is actually a pretty neat format
Bitmin,zero armada is probably a busted team tho
Bitmin,not really
Bitmin,They have the smash ball on
Bitmin,I mean the bracket format
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,of dubs -> singles
Bitmin,cringey announcer
Bitmin,funnyskit tho
Bitmin,I figured armada would pick pokemon trainer because he really likes ivysaur
Bitmin,cheering for zero armada
Bitmin,you can act out of airdodge
Bitmin,it's got some lag tho
Bitmin,that map was wack
Bitmin,oh they play one map
Bitmin,lol 2nd at evo 2017... someone's got their info wrong
Bitmin,"2015, yes, 2017 no"
Bitmin,unlucky
Bitmin,bayo looks more reasonable now
Bitmin,he stuff's got more knockback
Bitmin,you know the slowmo prolly makes it really easy to di
Bitmin,but you still CAN do the old combos but it's way harder
Bitmin,hopefully you can turn slowmo off
Bitmin,"also, while there's no lcancelling it looks like you've got way less landing lag on stuff"
Bitmin,I might main bayo
Bitmin,its a consideration
Bitmin,They haven't even shown how each character plays yet
Bitmin,My list of potential mains is rather long
Bitmin,Just because they were good in smash 4 doesn't really mean they will continue to be good with all these new characters
Bitmin,True beans
Bitmin,there are only 2 new characters
Bitmin,Still more characters than smash 4
Bitmin,Things can change
Bitmin,They only have access to 30 characters right now
Bitmin,hbox v reggie again
Bitmin,LETS GET SOME 1V1
Bitmin,Random cosplayers?
Bitmin,wutface
Bitmin,Obese Ness lol
Bitmin,they're all fat]
Bitmin,Wtf
Bitmin,Ness is sweatin'
Bitmin,Lucky thought that game was a ffa match LOLOLOL
Bitmin,He was attacking Mr. R on purpose
Bitmin,derp
Bitmin,wat
Bitmin,the legend
Bitmin,Lol
Bitmin,zero's prolly got this in the bag
Bitmin,Where's the Charizard
Bitmin,pokemon trainer looks kinda neat tho
Bitmin,I think if you work out the changes mid-combo 'n stuff you've got some tricks
Bitmin,This doesn't look that good
Bitmin,armada didn't really do anything with it tho
Bitmin,also ike looks sick
Bitmin,he's so fast
Bitmin,F MangO
Bitmin,mewtwo's sooo fast
Bitmin,hot damn
Bitmin,that was actually pretty good
Bitmin,and they were using wavelands and stuff
Bitmin,My man plup
Bitmin,I have faith in this game being good
Bitmin,is this genesis?
Bitmin,Items 
Bitmin,I mean yeah the items were a bit weird
Bitmin,THAT AINT ZELDA
Bitmin,but the standard play was legit
Bitmin,It looked real nice
Bitmin,I want to see the finals
Bitmin,Snake vs Sheik
Bitmin,sure the combos aren't stellar but it looks like it's got setups and such that you didn't have as much in sm4sh
Bitmin,hopefully no items
Bitmin,that was actually pretty hype at the end
Bitmin,like you've got post-combo positioning setups that look real good
Bitmin,WHY
Bitmin,this is so pointless
Bitmin,shhh
Bitmin,it's pandering to hte casuals
Bitmin,"Pointless, unless they bring out actual people"
Bitmin,who are these people??
Bitmin,Who are these people?
Bitmin,Who TF???
Bitmin,I mean there was an ign person
Bitmin,but I dunno
Bitmin,these are pretty meh vips
Bitmin,just give me reggie vs hbox
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Tfw they play DK crew song when a big black guy comes on stage 
Bitmin,i know blacknerdcomedy has a youtube
Bitmin,which is quite popular
Bitmin,well  its already over
Bitmin,that kyogre sweep lol
Bitmin,I think Zelda and Sheik are the same character again
Bitmin,they said no
Bitmin,they showed up as different characters in the initial intro
Bitmin,The girl's name is Zelda
Bitmin,Not the character
Bitmin,I see
Bitmin,"remeber kids, Animal Crossing teaches you that Taxation is theft"
Bitmin,sheik looks really fun
Bitmin,COMBOS
Bitmin,OMG
Bitmin,yo that was nutty
Bitmin,Sheik looks really fun
Bitmin,That was insane
Bitmin,they both look super fun
Bitmin,Dang
Bitmin,actual combos
Bitmin,MKleo dropped the ball
Bitmin,also snake's uptilt's the same lol
Bitmin,i already said both those things max
Bitmin,naw that was honestly all zero
Bitmin,he's a sneaky bastard
Bitmin,it's nuts
Bitmin,The set up from snake in the beginning of the final stock
Bitmin,This game looks dope
Bitmin,wait is there rage?
Bitmin,I actually want a switch now
Bitmin,yeah :(
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,if the game's this intense day 1 I'm looking forward to it
Bitmin,rage is actually the most dumb mechanic
Bitmin,like sure there's some clear similarities to sm4sh so people get a head start but still
Bitmin,yeah rage is weird
Bitmin,rage?
Bitmin,"higher your %, more knockback"
Bitmin,ah
Bitmin,makes it super hard to kill when you're at low % and easy to make comebacks
Bitmin,and also hard to combo low % people when you're at high %
Bitmin,How did MKLeo all 3 of those characters
Bitmin,I mean
Bitmin,2 smash 4 top tiers and snake
Bitmin,or it makes it easier to roll your opponent @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,"it seems like it was gonna make heavies really good cause they can live to high percents and kill before other people get to high, but heavies still kinda sucked"
Bitmin,yeah that too
Bitmin,Bay Vs. Ride mhmmm
Bitmin,wtf is that down B!?!
Bitmin,wait wat
Bitmin,how did he die at 17%
Bitmin,items LOL
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,lol bayo
Bitmin,fuck
Bitmin,Bayo needs to be nerfed
Bitmin,she's back
Bitmin,FML
Bitmin,She looks kind of fun not gonna lie
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,she's just old dumb bayo
Bitmin,gimme interesting bayo
Bitmin,not the same combo
Bitmin,although that might have been partially just ridley being huge
Bitmin,^ yeah
Bitmin,but sstill
Bitmin,that was hella dumb
Bitmin,bigger hitbox = easy combo
Bitmin,still the fact that she can do that to anyone is depressing
Bitmin,she is just dumb combo
Bitmin,Hype best of 3
Bitmin,maybe 2 sets
Bitmin,tfw WWE super star and it is not John Cena
Bitmin,oh hype spirit tracks music
Bitmin,I think
Bitmin,LOL WUT
Bitmin,nairo with a bunch of scrubs?
Bitmin,this is gonna be a slaughter
Bitmin,Nairo about to destroy some noobs
Bitmin,who allowed this
Bitmin,lololol
Bitmin,Secretly pro players
Bitmin,he's still gonna slaughter em
Bitmin,Lol
Bitmin,3 v 1 
Bitmin,3v1
Bitmin,items and no team attack might swing it a bit
Bitmin,this is great
Bitmin,Can Nairo do it?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,Nairo is about to get raped
Bitmin,he can but it'll be tough
Bitmin,items are good
Bitmin,he's one of the best sm4sh players
Bitmin,like the big three are zero mkleo and him
Bitmin,SNAKE!?!
Bitmin,also nairo's got a chance cause I think he just needs the most kills total
Bitmin,the crowd is singing the DK RAP LOL
Bitmin,i thought its was stocks ez for nairo
Bitmin,the taunt combo
Bitmin,poggers
Bitmin,what a god
Bitmin,+30 win inbound
Bitmin,
Bitmin,picking a heavy was pretty smart
Bitmin,I want to see the score ffs
Bitmin,Finally no items
Bitmin,or smash balls
Bitmin,and best of 3
Bitmin,lets go
Bitmin,mildly serious match
Bitmin,and a real stage
Bitmin,zero playing smash 4 lol
Bitmin,
Bitmin,bayo's not as busted hurray
Bitmin,it was just ridley being massive
Bitmin,I'm glad the neutral b has more knockback tho cause it suuuucked before
Bitmin,good balancing act
Bitmin,The bullets?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,bullets were as if fox had 2 guns
Bitmin,is MkLeo going to de throne ZeRo?
Bitmin,dunno if really counts as a dethroning
Bitmin,zero's been retired
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,how old is ZeRo
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,mid twenties I think?
Bitmin,mkleo's like seventeen tho
Bitmin,he is 23
Bitmin,just found it online
Bitmin,the end of a pro gamer age is around 23-25 apparently
Bitmin,Why does Mario have no moves with Cappy? 
Bitmin,cause then he would be garbage lol
Bitmin,unless they were to make it like link's boomerang
Bitmin,I mean there's a lot of smashers over 25
Bitmin,most good csgo players are > 25
Bitmin,zero didnt permenantly retire
Bitmin,Why did he retire?
Bitmin,stress
Bitmin,the Brain in the Human body starts to decline brain activity around 25 and onward
Bitmin,It may not be this case
Bitmin,thats not true
Bitmin,excuse me?
Bitmin,Do you really want to do this over the knowledge of the human body?
Bitmin,the reason most esports players retire is burnout not physical decline
Bitmin,"After 25 your reaction time, multitasking capability and and memory begin to slip."
Bitmin,"Mario vs. Sonic
ResidentSleeper"
Bitmin,Where's your source?
Bitmin,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319185.php
Bitmin,What happens to the brain as we age?
Bitmin,The brain begins to decline with age. We examine what happens to the brain over time and whether the rate of decline can be slowed or even prevented.
Bitmin,https://www.canyonranch.com/blog/health/how-your-brain-changes-with-age/
Bitmin,How Your Brain Changes With Age
Bitmin,"Take control of your brain health by learning about how your brain changes as you age, and techniques to stay sharp."
Bitmin,Not like it matters cause when I showed you sources before you did not take it seriously anyways lol
Bitmin,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19542656/your-brain-as-you-age/
Bitmin,Has Your Brain Already Peaked?
Bitmin,New research from MIT suggests that mental decline begins far younger than is typically thought
Bitmin,anyways
Bitmin,YAY ZeRo!
Bitmin,yeah but neither of those things is super important for smash
Bitmin,and it's such a slow decline at first
Bitmin,that experience is more important
Bitmin,"like, there's street fighter players in their 30's"
Bitmin,"very true, exactly"
Bitmin,wow daigo is 37
Bitmin,I didn't realize he was that old
Bitmin,people with higher still take longer to age
Bitmin,the age of retirement for both sports and esports is getting higher and higher
Bitmin,so it the age of how long people live
Bitmin,your point?
Bitmin,federer is almost 37 and he still dominates when he is playing well
Bitmin,that is my point
Bitmin,i was just noting something interesting
Bitmin,is he a very high skilled player?
Bitmin,like Top teir?
Bitmin,leffen on the right
Bitmin,both players me and kameron have mentioned are old and still top 5 in their respective (e)sports
Bitmin,then it is a correlation between the amount of skill the person has and the rate that the skill of a person declines. All I was saying is that the decline starts at the approximate age of 25. nothing else.
Bitmin,you said their careers are basically over at 25
Bitmin,which is provably not true
Bitmin,hell it should be even worse in sports cause your physical skills also decline but it's still entirely possible to keep at it
Bitmin,"I said ""the end"" not drop dead over  or done."
Bitmin,The ending of a carrer does not have to be a drop dead date just a time period
Bitmin,Is anything else happening today or is that it?
Bitmin,I thought we were getting some sort of reveal
Bitmin,Stream went dark
Bitmin,F
Bitmin,Is it over then?
Bitmin,weird ass ending
Bitmin,you guys wanna talk?

Bitmin,Running around on furniture and being ridiculously wild.
Bitmin,Never before in my life have I been compelled to hit a child
Bitmin,But this experience has dulled any wavering desire I had to have children. On the off chance that mine would turn out this retarded
Bitmin,That's up to you for your own children not to act that way
Bitmin,Bless up. I guess these kids are really relfecting poorly on the mother sitting here doing nothing

Bitmin,"in pseudo code,

if list is sorted
    return list
else
    destroy the universe"
Bitmin,"it operates on the multiverse theory, such that after running the algorithm, only universes where the list was sorted to begin with remain"
Bitmin,"this allows it to run in O(n), an improvement from the general standard of O(n log n)"

Bitmin,I will pay ass loads of money for quartz

Bitmin,max did you say you'd donate rails to the project?
Bitmin,I will if my island is a stop
Bitmin,it is
Bitmin,Jed I will donate 10 stacks of rails if you let me design the station on my half of the island
Bitmin,The way it's setup is slighkty off the side of your island
Bitmin,Cool
Bitmin,I just gave myself a concussion boys

Bitmin,Gg
Bitmin,@Max where you at homie
Bitmin,@Homies my parents dont think I should use the PC tonight
Bitmin,Because concussion
Bitmin,how bad is it?
Bitmin,It's extra strong yeet 90%
Bitmin,@Jed if you see Astoria at camp tell her she's a crazy bitch
Bitmin,How did you get that diagnosed already?
Bitmin,"Didnt actually. ER wait times were a few hours so I yoted home. I feel better though. Might be something minor, I did black  out though LOL"
Bitmin,Hours long wait times at the ER sounds dangerous
Bitmin,you get bumped at ER based on seriousness of your condition
Bitmin,"hence how that time I thought I might have broken my wrist, I was in a nearly empty ER and still had a super long wait casue people with more pressing stuff kept showing up"
Bitmin,"also, be very careful about concussions, if it's not feeling better tomorrow get it checked out"
Bitmin,"cause they can cause serious long-term problems, especially if you don't realize you have one"
Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,I am going to see my actual doctor tomorrow
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak when did you break your wrist
Bitmin,"I didn't, but I did do a decent amount of damage"
Bitmin,in an entertainly stupid sequence of events
Bitmin,"my house is near the top of a hill, and me and my brother decided it'd be fun to go down the hill on these -"
Bitmin,"together, holding on to one another"
Bitmin,m
Bitmin,or
Bitmin,on
Bitmin,and taking turns throwing the other person further down to pick up speed
Bitmin,and then their extra speed would be a boost to the other person
Bitmin,"basically we eventually messed up, I hit a lawn, flew over it onto the sidewalk, and caught all my weight on a bad angle on my wrist"
Bitmin,"it didn't break, but I messed up the bone and the connective tissue and stuff"
Bitmin,hurt like hell
Bitmin,and I was still in a sling/brace for a few weeks
Bitmin,sylki
Bitmin,you are a god damned legend
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,help us find your island
Bitmin,we are finna tryna connect it
Bitmin,There's a nether portal to it
Bitmin,through my portal?
Bitmin,yeah but we wanna railway
Bitmin,Look at the coordinates
Bitmin,"pffft today I learned that there's a speedrunning category for ocarina of time called ""dank percent"" where the goal is to get off a bug that makes it look like link is smoking a giant blunt as fast as you can"
Bitmin,yee
Bitmin,and it's officially recognized on speedrun.com
Bitmin,world record at just over eight and a half minutes
Bitmin,I'm just skimming the other officially recognized categories for this game and some are hilarious
Bitmin,"like ""Go Home and Die %"", where the goal is to die while inside a house as fast as possible"
Bitmin,What is the record for that one?
Bitmin,8m18s
Bitmin,there's also a category to complete the game without ever opening any doors
Bitmin,"there's a category to complete the game all the way to the water temple, and then while inside get to a total of 37 small keys"
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak have you seen full metal alchemist
Bitmin,he thinks its overrated
Bitmin,i think zacks overrated
Bitmin,ava sums it up nicely
Bitmin,"it's a solid show, but beyond the first chunk I felt like it just gets larger, more unweildy, and slower, and nothing it does beyond a few early bits really stood out to me"
Bitmin,it just feels like a decently executed generic show that gets worse as it goes on
Bitmin,"I agree, full metal alchemist is overrated."
Bitmin,"I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it, at least not before a lot of other things"
Bitmin,Especially brotherhood.
Bitmin,"I haven't seen the original, but from what I've heard, it's even more filled with fluff"
Bitmin,I'm one of those people who doesn't watch main stream anime. I stick to the more lesser know stuff.
Bitmin,"And to me, (a true anime fan), main stream animes are just... Not good animes."
Bitmin,how do you define a true anime fan
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,A true anime fan is someone who enjoys other animes then mainstream.
Bitmin,"I would have gone with just ""a person who enjoys anime, regardless of other peoples' opinions of any given anime"""
Bitmin,"Also, I feel like to be a true anime fan, you have to watch at least 5 different animes that aren't mainstream."
Bitmin,also just in general I feel like there's literally no reason to subdivide a community and it'll only cause problems and toxicity and elitism
Bitmin,both of those defintion are super arbitrary
Bitmin,being a fan should be whatever you think it is
Bitmin,True.
Bitmin,I'm only saying what I define it as for myself
Bitmin,idk i just find the gate keeping shit to be really autistic
Bitmin,"@mrd256  stop being an elitist, that is so stupid. Anyone who says you have to watch non-mainstream anime to be a ""true anime fan"" is just trying way too hard to look cool and feel above other people. It literally doesn't matter at all. You're not special because you watch things that less people think are good. Get off your high horse."
Bitmin,"Also, as someone who had an obsession with Yu-gi-oh for years you have no right to try to be cool lol"
Bitmin,"on another note you said watch five anime that aren't mainstream. FIVE???? That's it? If you want to go on about ""true anime fans"" it should at least be someone who has seen a heck of a lot of anime. My list is up in the 80's (which isn't even all that much). Beat that, rookie."
Bitmin,Who said I only watched five?
Bitmin,"okay hot shot, how much anime have you watched?"
Bitmin,but honestly it doesn't even matter
Bitmin,people are entitled to like whatever anime they like and I think all people's opinions are equally valid because they're just opinions about stupid entertainment media and it doesn't matter
Bitmin,and this is coming from someone who has watch both mainstream and non-mainstream anime
Bitmin,"@Feral Nebula It's probably not as much as you, but I have watched more than 5
Owari no Seraph
Ore no Twintail narimasu
Kissxsis
High School DXD
Date A Live
Angel Beats
Charlotte
Erased (even though I hated it)
Fuuka 
Rakudai kishi no Cavalry
Miira no Kaitaka
The Devil is a part timer
Shinmai Maou no Testament
Caligula
and I can list more if I need to"
Bitmin,I didn't need a list lol
Bitmin,you asked for it
Bitmin,that's only 14 lol
Bitmin,and isn't Kissxsis an incest anime ???
Bitmin,still more than 5!
Bitmin,isn't it hentai?
Bitmin,but it's a gulty pleasure
Bitmin,pffft
Bitmin,no it's not a hentai
Bitmin,I stay away from hentai at all costs
Bitmin,okay buddy
Bitmin,also tbh most of those anime ARE mainstream. Maybe not as mainstream as naruto or FMAB but they are still well known. And the ones that aren't on your list are just plain bad lol
Bitmin,well yeah
Bitmin,then what kinda point are you tryna prove ????
Bitmin,"big animes like Naruto, One Piece, Boku no Hero Academia, FLCL, and others of such are ones I try to stay away from"
Bitmin,FLCL????
Bitmin,is that mainstream??
Bitmin,the new series
Bitmin,I forget what it's called.
Bitmin,I know what you're talking about but that anime is not mainstream as much as naruto ect.
Bitmin,"whatever, believe what you want to believe"
Bitmin,lol okay
Bitmin,have fun thinking you're cooler than you are
Bitmin,the real answer is none of us are cool because we all watch anime
Bitmin,coming from a girl says she's a weeboo
Bitmin,"I just called myself uncool too, you know"
Bitmin,but the weeb thing is a joke. I'm not the actual definition of a weeaboo
Bitmin,I never said I was cool. I was just trying to say I don't like to watch (many) mainstream animes
Bitmin,"right, but when people are being elitist they are trying to make themselves look higher than others"
Bitmin,"""a true anime fan"""
Bitmin,I'm just trying to say that is a toxic mindset
Bitmin,I didn't say I was the only one
Bitmin,I didn't say you said that wym ???
Bitmin,throws arms in the air and gives up
Bitmin,later
Bitmin,haha
Bitmin,I'm so amused
Bitmin,"slides back in briefly
in all fairness, as much as the 'true anime fan' thing is often toxic and elitest, the majority of the toxicity and elitism in this conversation is coming from ava"
Bitmin,"so get off yo high horse, ava"
Bitmin,whaaaaat
Bitmin,Im not ! !
Bitmin,   thank you Zack!
Bitmin,people who use that emoji unironically should die
Bitmin,it's just hard to talk to stupid people so I'm sorry if I sounded toxic
Bitmin,"let's see:
you called him a rookie,
one of his shows a hentai,
laughed at his guilty pleasure,
told him most of what he'd seen was bad,
etc., I'm too lazy to pick through the rest of this"
Bitmin,also that is one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard
Bitmin,because you insulted him during the apology
Bitmin,I largely agree with your general opinion about stuff but you're arguing it so badly
Bitmin,I wasn't trying to be sincere lol
Bitmin,also I called it a hentai because i genuinely thought it was
Bitmin,whoops
Bitmin,but anyway I was saying all that stuff because he thought he was too good and I wanted to knock him down I guess
Bitmin,"anyhoo, this whole discussion is such a mess that I would genuinely prefer to go back to work than continue having it, so I'm out"
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,sorry Sylki
Bitmin,well that conversation got out of hand real fast lol
Bitmin,Holy shit
Bitmin,I ask Zack if he has seen a show I'm watching
Bitmin,And the retard fort opens the floodgates of autism
Bitmin,"goddammit I'm on hold and they go ""press the pound sign to not have to listen to music"""
Bitmin,so I did
Bitmin,and instead they're now just advertising themselves
Bitmin,this is not what I wanted
Bitmin,Who you calling sylk boi
Bitmin,a hosting service cause the hosting's all fucked up
Bitmin,why are all the hardest parts of getting a website going things that have nothing to do with making the website
Bitmin,i know right its some stupid ass shit
Bitmin,@Zain has Daniel contacted you? I think I'm going to rape him on your behalf

Bitmin,Keep listening to 500 miles
Bitmin,HOpe you can find a solution to whatever problems are plagueing your work
Bitmin,"it's like,
if this man can walk 500 miles to demonstrate his dedication to some chick, I can at least get this dumb thing done"

Bitmin,how had we not figured out that roy sucked by then
Bitmin,Roy was ranked 15th on the 2005 tier list (he is 20th currently)
Bitmin,"I mean, you don't see any marios in top 10 these days"
Bitmin,he's 15th now
Bitmin,I was saying that we had figured out he was bad
Bitmin,"it's more just, how had top players not figured out how to beat roy"
Bitmin,This guy must have just been good
Bitmin,"Also, the cc meta pretty much didn't exist then"
Bitmin,fair
Bitmin,"still, step it up 2005 melee"
Bitmin,If any of us went back to 2004-5 melee we probably could have been top players. With how far the meta has come I imagine an average player today could be excellent

Bitmin,why do you hate mashed potatoes
Bitmin,that was the 1 seed
Bitmin,mashed potatoes are god tier
Bitmin,green beans were 16 seed
Bitmin,yeah but they got onion rings round 2
Bitmin,also stuffing got fucked
Bitmin,deserved way better than round 1 vs garlic bread
Bitmin,Garlic was seed 2 stuffing was seed 15
Bitmin,thats how it goes
Bitmin,ok but
Bitmin,what even is rice pilaf
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,tomato bisque???
Bitmin,it's a soup
Bitmin,thats just soup
Bitmin,a decent one
Bitmin,also stuffing is barely a side
Bitmin,but how common even is that
Bitmin,thats why its seeded low
Bitmin,"also I agree, stuffing is like,, a holiday only food"
Bitmin,Still a side though
Bitmin,yeah but barely tho hence the seed
Bitmin,that's like doing a pie tourney and sticking pumpkin pie super low
Bitmin,just cause it's mostly a thanksgiving thing
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,thats actually a good point
Bitmin,What should the next theme be?

Bitmin,he honestly might have been able to 2-0 him but he SD'd the first stock
Bitmin,noooooo
Bitmin,he had it and then he SD'd twice game three
Bitmin,That was so close
Bitmin,he'd better go ham in loser's
Bitmin,The Asian guy?
Bitmin,Will Evo still be on tonight ?
Bitmin,prolly not melee

Bitmin,I've ended up half working and half watching other games cause melee's still pretty meh for the most part
Bitmin,I'm currently watching one of the most busted and poorly balanced fighting games of all time that's being run at a side event at evo
Bitmin,Which game is that?
Bitmin,it's this ancient snes sailor moon fighting game
Bitmin,"there's two torontonians in winner's finals, so I'm hyped for that, I guess"
Bitmin,also they both play hilariously busted characters so I can't wait to see that match
Bitmin,link?
Bitmin,"one character has absurd range on all her moves, a full screen dash, and a really strong command grab
the other one is crazy fast, and if they get under around 1/6 health they can stall infinitely and slowly chip you down until you have less health than them at timeout and they win"

Bitmin,yo squid lost to some hawaiian rando
Bitmin,"lololol toph's playing and his full tag shows up as ""THE READS Toph"""
Bitmin,yo who won the wobbles kjh set @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,kjh
Bitmin,wobbles wasn't wobbling
Bitmin,he did some cool handoffs though
Bitmin,he prolly wants to commentate
Bitmin,I figure he's mostly just there to have fun
Bitmin,and also commentate
Bitmin,but yeah
Bitmin,goddammit

Bitmin,good sheik players make sheik look like such a good character
Bitmin,whereas bad spacies make spacies look trash lol
Bitmin,I dont get why fox players ban to battlefield vs sheik
Bitmin,when most sheik players counterpick battlefield
Bitmin,just ban bfield and then FOD or yoshis based on preference
Bitmin,they could leverage the stage advantage so much more
Bitmin,"As a sheik player, which stage do you prefer against foxes"
Bitmin,i mean it doesnt really matter cause im not very good
Bitmin,colbol beat amsa
Bitmin,imo the fox-yoshi matchup is like 65-35
Bitmin,RISHI BEAT M2K
Bitmin,SMASH GOD
Bitmin,wouldnt it be sick if there was a top player who was a puff/marth dual main?
Bitmin,like what if hbox had m2k's marth
Bitmin,Then they would be unstoppable
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane wanna watch Evo when I get home from work?
Bitmin,melee with the most viewers at evo rn

Bitmin,join the cord ill explain
Bitmin,@Zain Is darwin project good?
Bitmin,I like it
Bitmin,Is it a game that could be played together or is it only solo queue?
Bitmin,@Melee this training pack is actually really really cool
Bitmin,highly recommended
Bitmin,Lololol I didn't see sm4sh grands but what I'm hearing about it sounds hilarious
Bitmin,Bayo dittos
Bitmin,Whole crowd booing
Bitmin,Apparently at one point they both sat on opposite ends of the stage and charged neutral b for so long a TO had to come out and give them shit about it
Bitmin,Game's dead I think
Bitmin,Or maybe this is what happens when #1 and #2 can't make evo
Bitmin,Nobody fucking cares about that game anymore
Bitmin,Melee is still hype
Bitmin,Bayo and Cloud were the worst things to ever happen to smash 4
Bitmin,It was pretty balanced before then
Bitmin,The list of viable characters was pretty long
Bitmin,But still fundamentally boring to play and watch
Bitmin,They are playing the DK rap on the evo stream lol
Bitmin,"also, at least cloud is actually fairly fun to watch, compared to a lot of the cast"
Bitmin,bayo not so much
Bitmin,Guy with a smash ultimate shirt standing behind the players
Bitmin,Announcement incoming?
Bitmin,I think the leaks said something was supposed to get announced at evo
Bitmin,They did
Bitmin,"and even without that, evo's a pretty good time to announce anything about a fighting game"
Bitmin,I think a few other games have had little announcements already
Bitmin,hey I overslept is this the first match @Max
Bitmin,There have not been any games yet
Bitmin,fantastic
Bitmin,did i miss anything on the stream
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,fantastic
Bitmin,YO HBOX
Bitmin,he just took 3 stocks in like 40 seconds
Bitmin,why did he ban fd and not stadium?
Bitmin,I think FD is worse
Bitmin,Right call imo
Bitmin,hot take leffen wins evo
Bitmin,Lets go
Bitmin,wow
Bitmin,"3 stock in hbox's favour, last hit, 3 stock in leffen's favour"
Bitmin,wack set
Bitmin,just to note my message was before stock 1 of the 3rd game
Bitmin,Amazing not to tilt after game 1
Bitmin,although real talk hbox was flubbing left and right
Bitmin,I say he's either gonna crumble or go on a nutty loser's run
Bitmin,time to cheer for wizzy over swedish
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,swedish
Bitmin,lets go
Bitmin,@Zain Mango about to play
Bitmin,alrightr
Bitmin,"I like swedish, but wizzy has a much much better record over hbox"
Bitmin,yeah of da sheiks

Bitmin,evo - Twitch
Bitmin,EVO 2018 - CHAMPIONSHIP SUNDAY
Bitmin,also swedish has looked good against hbox in da past
Bitmin,and plup beat him with sheik at CEO
Bitmin,We could have armada Hbox for 4th
Bitmin,plup is so good
Bitmin,and mango so bad
Bitmin,rip mango
Bitmin,that
Bitmin,was so sad
Bitmin,that was a very mango set
Bitmin,That was pretty good
Bitmin,"he played amazing for a chunk of it, mediocre for a chunk, and SD'd a bunch"
Bitmin,the first game was sick by plup tho
Bitmin,yaw first game plup was playing out of his mind
Bitmin,New gods winners finals
Bitmin,lets go
Bitmin,big house part 2
Bitmin,This is winnable
Bitmin,S2J has almost beat him before
Bitmin,"and when he did, he won the first two games"
Bitmin,which would be the set in this case
Bitmin,that'd be crazy though
Bitmin,I'd put like 80/20 odds on armada winning
Bitmin,shoutouts2jesus
Bitmin,
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,That's s2j
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,someone said in chat
Bitmin,armada has gotten 3 stitches since being put in losers
Bitmin,the script boys
Bitmin,damnn
Bitmin,those stocks were spicy
Bitmin,SHOUTOUTS TO JESUS
Bitmin,hes losing on fod tho
Bitmin,He might opt for fd instead
Bitmin,huh
Bitmin,bfield?
Bitmin,S2J can do this
Bitmin,I wanna see armada mango
Bitmin,not s2j mango
Bitmin,chokes
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,so many special turnips
Bitmin,chooooookes
Bitmin,s2j choked that so hard
Bitmin,S2j is out?
Bitmin,"Hey guys, I'm here from Guilty Gear, just wanted to say that I can see why you were being a bunch of immature children in chat - seeing as you literally play a kids game. Honestly, it's just sad seeing you losers spam emotes every time Mario does his jump attack or whatever. Grow up!."
Bitmin,What is this copy pasta
Bitmin,From the chat
Bitmin,ik
Bitmin,@Trapezoider S2J is out but wizzy is still in
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Waiting for this special ed kid's game to be over so I can watch some fucking tekken.
Bitmin,same
Bitmin,I HAVE A 3 WORD ESSAY DUE TOMORROW AND I'M WATCHING MELEE NotLikeThis
Bitmin,Why is this Swedish dude wearing sunglasses
Bitmin,he has eye issues
Bitmin,its not just for style
Bitmin,is winners finals b05 or just losers and grands?
Bitmin,I think winners finals is bo5
Bitmin,Leffen said so on his twitter at least
Bitmin,Did you guys just see the camera?
Bitmin,well he could just be saying that because hes gonna be in either grands or losers finals
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,wow mango
Bitmin,that was... pretty bad
Bitmin,how does he almost always play terrible at evo
Bitmin,we need a better bird player
Bitmin,He puts a lot of pressure on himself probably
Bitmin,the bird must fly again
Bitmin,"From chat ""we live in a world where s2j took a game off armada and mango didnt... hmmmm"""
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,"real talk tho, mango was playing really sloppy"
Bitmin,like s2j game 3 slop
Bitmin,ouch wizzy
Bitmin,wizzy finna save melee?
Bitmin,The only falcon to ever play the character correctly
Bitmin,yeah n0ne of course
Bitmin,also 1/4 of both the top 12 and top 8 were falcon players thats pretty wack
Bitmin,its over
Bitmin,bruh
Bitmin,damn
Bitmin,damn
Bitmin,that was super close though
Bitmin,hbox's pressure was so good once he had the lead though
Bitmin,wizzy needed space and hbox wasn't giving him any
Bitmin,leffen unstopable
Bitmin,I'll stop him
Bitmin,go chris
Bitmin,fox ditto time?
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,Leffen is so good
Bitmin,My inspiration
Bitmin,he's crazy
Bitmin,plup is kinda like new mew2king
Bitmin,he gets deflated p easy
Bitmin,i dont see him winning in losers
Bitmin,ouch
Bitmin,yo boys we finna play some melee after evo
Bitmin,this is so tense
Bitmin,this aint even grands
Bitmin,ouch
Bitmin,Almost a time out
Bitmin,clutchbox please
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,is wizzy still here?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,NO
Bitmin,well i have no reason to watch this tream then 
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,Melee is saved
Bitmin,Thank god armada won
Bitmin,evo is hype
Bitmin,hes so chubby
Bitmin,watch anyway
Bitmin,yeeees armada
Bitmin,Hbox doesn't even have shoes on
Bitmin,guys can we joinup like????
Bitmin,This is hype city
Bitmin,leffen plup armada top 3 this is pretty much as well as I could have hoped for
Bitmin,
Bitmin,its not even grand finals
Bitmin,plup leffen grand finals
Bitmin,Lets go
Bitmin,that's what I'm hoping for
Bitmin,"I want fifteen games from hereon out, and I honestly don't really care that much how they go if we get that"
Bitmin,My boy big leff better win this
Bitmin,@Melee can we all joinup for grandfinals ples
Bitmin,not gonna lie armada winning would be sick
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,gay^
Bitmin,even though i dont likeem
Bitmin,I kinda want the armada insane loser's run
Bitmin,I want to listen to the casters
Bitmin,armada winning would mean beating 6 of the other top 9 members
Bitmin,and every other top 6 player
Bitmin,FROM LOSERS
Bitmin,who did wizrobe play before hbox knocked him out
Bitmin,i cant see on the bracket
Bitmin,to get the 3vo
Bitmin,swedish
Bitmin,which other evos did armada win
Bitmin,2015 2017
Bitmin,2017 and 2015
Bitmin,"over hbox in 2015, mango in 2017"
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,mango won 2013 and 14
Bitmin,hbox 2016

Bitmin,press 1 to vote for armada
Bitmin,1
Bitmin,is this live?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,:0
Bitmin,LETS GO PLUP
Bitmin,wait
Bitmin,was the rest of the bracket 2/3?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,wow
Bitmin,it's cause it's evo
Bitmin,they need it to run quickly enough
Bitmin,also the evo top brass don't much care for melee
Bitmin,hence our shitty time slot
Bitmin,why
Bitmin,we bring so much to the event
Bitmin,Thats so dumb
Bitmin,cause they're old school fgc people
Bitmin,Dont we literally get the most viewers?
Bitmin,"the main head guy apparently loooooves tekken even though it doesn't get as good viewership as melee, sf, dbfz and he gave tekken a ton of preferential treatment"
Bitmin,thats so dumb
Bitmin,i didnt know the evo staff was gay
Bitmin,randall!!
Bitmin,melee in particular has a history of getting shafted in various ways at evo
Bitmin,this year's the worst though probably
Bitmin,I missed most of top 8 because of this time slot
Bitmin,Armada hype
Bitmin,Didn't we get Saturday last year
Bitmin,oh yeah
Bitmin,but at least we didn't have super early morning pools
Bitmin,"""Whenever I see top players do what I do. Alarm bells"""
Bitmin,Scar is awesome
Bitmin,he's a good commentator for higher level discussion of stuff
Bitmin,"where he's not as deep in the nitty gritty details, but he understands players and mentalities really well"
Bitmin,Have toph and scar done every evo?
Bitmin,fox is stupid
Bitmin,no u
Bitmin,YES
Bitmin,up air is such a dumb move
Bitmin,"I don't think they did the super old school evos, but I'm pretty sure they've done top 8 or at least top 4 from 2013-2018"
Bitmin,jbaited
Bitmin,"honestly, it wouldn't feel like evo at this point without scar and toph"
Bitmin,they are such a good combo
Bitmin,armada 4 stock
Bitmin,also real talk
Bitmin,how many times has plup gotten 3rd at evo
Bitmin,+1 more times
Bitmin,I feel bad
Bitmin,yeah plup's not looking like his normal self
Bitmin,the boost grab he missed was so sad
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Time for leffen to take it
Bitmin,ever since he beat mango he's been not looking that good
Bitmin,"but yeah, I think this is... 3 or 4 now"
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,poggers?
Bitmin,Nintendo direct in 3 days
Bitmin,
Bitmin,pfft nintendo cop out on making an actual announcement
Bitmin,poggers
Bitmin,they announced an announcement
Bitmin,what a bunch of fucking champs
Bitmin,I dont like the evo stage this year
Bitmin,it was way cooler last year
Bitmin,
Bitmin,WAIT ITS THE SAME?????? It looks so different from some of these angles
Bitmin,"I honestly don't really care who wins this, so long as this is as good as their sets normally are"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,that nose shine
Bitmin,Leffen looking fresh
Bitmin,holy shit
Bitmin,what a fucking god
Bitmin,"""proto tractor pro tractor"
Bitmin,what a fucking new god
Bitmin,what was that???
Bitmin,one more
Bitmin,OH

Bitmin,?
Bitmin,no idea
Bitmin,never heard of him

Bitmin,About to fight one prolly
Bitmin,I have almost no knowledge on that matchup. I will say though that you are good at tech chasing and should probably go for that. Just don't forget to actually lead it into moves eventually in order to really build up damage.

Bitmin,are there any zerg experts?
Bitmin,oh right andrew
Bitmin,Andrew is a decent player
Bitmin,"so it's me and andrew, you and any terran, who's protossing?"
Bitmin,Don't you play Protoss?
Bitmin,more zerg lately
Bitmin,I was assuming you would be the protoss
Bitmin,I could
Bitmin,We could shuffle Andrew on to terran you to zerg and me to protoss
Bitmin,I prefer zerg lately but I could help with whoever's the new protoss
Bitmin,Kameron is the terran Zain is the zerg and Chris is the protoss
Bitmin,zack go back to work
Bitmin,"I mean we can start with me and chris, you and kameron, and andrew zain and then rotate as needed"
Bitmin,Sounds good
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,Why?
Bitmin,I don't play Terran
Bitmin,I only know zerg macro
Bitmin,The line up he listed would make you zerg
Bitmin,I will get bodied
Bitmin,When is this happening
Bitmin,Tonight if everyone is available I think
Bitmin,I mean I think no matter what the team with me as the 'experienced' player is gonna get fucked
Bitmin,since it is a 1v1v1 you can always shift alliances depending on who is winning
Bitmin,lol true
Bitmin,Would you guys want to do it later tonight or are you too busy?

Bitmin,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

Bitmin,idle curiosity
Bitmin,Zack
Bitmin,Question
Bitmin,born from laughing at marth's pitiful upthrow kill
Bitmin,wondering who else could kill from their best combo throws
Bitmin,What's marths up throw kill?
Bitmin,he throws you up and you die if you're a floaty
Bitmin,at like 200+
Bitmin,once he hits marthritis it's sometimes his best kill option

Bitmin,HYPE
Bitmin,Xbox works
Bitmin,"pools commentary is, although kind of crap, perfectly fitting for pools"
Bitmin,they're not even talking about the set except for every now and then
Bitmin,they're just going off on ridiculous tangents about photosynthesis
Bitmin,"but like, it's sfat bodying some rando"
Bitmin,actual commentary would be kinda weird
Bitmin,holy shit mango almost lost that set
Bitmin,Who was he against?
Bitmin,some random puff
Bitmin,he's not even top 100
Bitmin,Was he playing Falco?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,"lololol he just walked over to the commentary and goes ""no one ever talks about my good double lasers. Those were some good double lasers that set"""
Bitmin,nothing about the fact that he just went last hit with some non-top 100 player
Bitmin,"Ok @Homies I gotta break the news to you now, I don't think the game has online multiplayer"
Bitmin,bummer dude
Bitmin,I'm becoming more and more sure that hbox takes damage on purpose once he is at 50 until he is at around 90.
Bitmin,Why?
Bitmin,So that all the easy kill setups don't work
Bitmin,"at around 90 you can't really upthrow upair, weak nair upsmash, I dunno if jab upsmash works (I think jab upair still works but it's hard)"
Bitmin,Are you guys seeing this
Bitmin,basically your only safe-ish kill option becomes bair at like 140
Bitmin,Those drawings lol
Bitmin,"also, n0ne 3-1'd wizzy let's go"
Bitmin,he's gonna get bodied by zain probably though
Bitmin,When I play vs puff I actually don't laser past up throw up air %
Bitmin,also pewpewu vs s2j should be good
Bitmin,oh damn moky brought shroomed to game 5
Bitmin,lol n0ne
Bitmin,he was going so ham
Bitmin,and then he just
Bitmin,jumps in the middle of a marth combo
Bitmin,and that's that
Bitmin,Did mango drop out of shine?
Bitmin,naw
Bitmin,there's two brackets to top 8
Bitmin,this is only one half
Bitmin,there's still another 32 person bracket going on after this
Bitmin,These stats are so pointless
Bitmin,They should have the openings per kill stat
Bitmin,That is by far the best one
Bitmin,or edgeguard %
Bitmin,Yo
Bitmin,What tourney is going on?
Bitmin,shine 2018

Bitmin,man plup had such a nice run to top 8
Bitmin,fairly weak puff -> samus ditto -> ics
Bitmin,"man why are they like ""in case you sheiks are struggling with this matchup, these tips might help!"""
Bitmin,they don't need the help
Bitmin,we samuses need the help
Bitmin,It is probably because neither of them know what help to give Samus. Sheik knowledge is much more widely known.
Bitmin,fair enough
Bitmin,"also, apparently void (the sm4sh guy) is pretty good at dbzf"
Bitmin,"he made top 8 at shine, which, while not super stacked, still has a few names I recognize"
Bitmin,admittadly they're both names I know from different games (one from skullgirls and one from p4au) but presumably they're still pretty good
Bitmin,What is p4au?
Bitmin,persona 4 arena
Bitmin,I'm not sure why they add the u
Bitmin,possibly the full title of one of the updates? persona 4 arena ultimax?
Bitmin,and also possibly cause p4a might be the acronym for persona 4 the animation
Bitmin,duuuuck that was a free fsmash
Bitmin,why did you try for bair
Bitmin,that only would have killed on sweet spot
Bitmin,I honestly think he might have taken that game if he'd just done fsmash

Bitmin,the only problem: it usually only gets been 3 and 6 entrants
Bitmin,"is it worth my time? it won't be a great tourney probably, and their schedule is wack as hell, probably to accomadate for the fact that they're running melee, sm4sh, and pm separately cause the venue is tiny"

Bitmin,he has a 2.5/5 rating
Bitmin,and all of his reviews say that the matlab assignments dont help you in class

Bitmin,"@The Rona whenever you're back, pokemon"

Bitmin,@Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane Why did neither of you message me?
Bitmin,leaving in a little bit
Bitmin,like 10-15 minutes
Bitmin,and I have a few things to do first
Bitmin,"@Jed ive been doing a lot of research into brain computer interfaces and I have come to the conclusion that your potential for deafness shouldn't be a concern for you. Similar to Moore's law, the number of electrodes in cochlear implants is increasing exponentially which will eventually result in them providing similar if not better performance to human ears. Thought this might be of interest to you"
Bitmin,@Trapezoider Lets play some melee tonight
Bitmin,@The Rona are you still at your grandparent's house?
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane you should also play against me
Bitmin,where is everyone else tho

Bitmin,564e67b5
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Sorry Bois @Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak :((((
Bitmin,Yo can someone help my level 1 python thing
Bitmin,"print('Interest Calculator:')
amount = float(input('Principal Amount?'))
roi = float(input('Rate of Interest?'))
years = input(int('Duration (no. of years) ?'))
total = (amount * pow(1 + (roi/100), years))
print('\nInterest = %0.2f' %interest)



For some reason when I am testing this and entering the roi, it spits out this"
Bitmin,"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""F:\PROGRAMS\calculator.py"", line 4, in <module>
    years = input(int('Duration (no. of years) ?'))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Duration (no. of years) ?'"
Bitmin,should be int(input('duration'))
Bitmin,so I dont wanna use a float value for roi
Bitmin,OH
Bitmin,this is for years
Bitmin,did you read the error message?
Bitmin,it tells you which line is going wrong
Bitmin,and a description of why
Bitmin,IVE Never debugged
Bitmin,i didnt get what the mans was trying to tell me
Bitmin,im using Thonny as my editor
Bitmin,"in this case, that there was something going wrong with the int() funciton, specifically that the arguments you gave it were invalid"
Bitmin,"at the very least, that should tell you where and what is going wrong"
Bitmin,"it has the problem after the roi bit because once you input the roi, it tries to run the next line of code, which has the error"
Bitmin,i fixed it
Bitmin,now i got another bug
Bitmin,ayo
Bitmin,i made a calculator. @Sak von Sak whats another easy beginning project I can work on
Bitmin,one I had fun with was making a text adventure game
Bitmin,oh wow
Bitmin,that sounds difficult
Bitmin,ill give it a go
Bitmin,do you know how to do loops yet?
Bitmin,cause you're gonna need em
Bitmin,no sir
Bitmin,i know how to print
Bitmin,how to make variables
Bitmin,ok step one learn how to do for and while loops
Bitmin,that with what you already know should be enough
Bitmin,thank you sack
Bitmin,@Homies what's the biggest mistake New comers make when learning a programming language? What's the most common trap to fall into that will set you back instead of progressing your learning
Bitmin,this question makes no sense
Bitmin,yea
Bitmin,i mean i guess
Bitmin,i think people shouldnt focus
Bitmin,on syntax and the language in it self
Bitmin,more on what they wanna make in it
Bitmin,incorrect syntax
Bitmin,but i dont
Bitmin,think
Bitmin,theres
Bitmin,much that could set you back
Bitmin,when learning a language
Bitmin,Why would you need to need to make that 5 messages
Bitmin,"programming isn't like english where you can do something wrong without noticing, if something is wrong in programming it wont work period"
Bitmin,so if things are working you're gucci
Bitmin,and if they aren't figure out why
Bitmin,ayyy anyone wanna play some ow or melee later? @Homies
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,I'll play melee
Bitmin,Okay. Im just prepping for my intro to python course this fall
Bitmin,And was hoping for advice :)
Bitmin,Thanks homies
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane ill play a few
Bitmin,"""later"""
Bitmin,I have to do matlab rn 
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,"A little tip that might help you @Trapezoider is to plan, either in your head or on a piece of paper, what the main function of your program is probably gonna look like"
Bitmin,ye
Bitmin,think about the process before the code
Bitmin,Just jumping straight into it can get confusing
Bitmin,and make you lose track
Bitmin,Planning I feel can also help with the efficiency of your program
Bitmin,@Homies games?

Bitmin,"Women’s Business Research reports that women-owned businesses are growing and that they:

Total more than 11 million and employ nearly 20 million workers."
Bitmin,Am I wrong or does this seem like more of an insult than praise
Bitmin,Those numbers seem to indicate most women owned businesses only employ 0-2 people
Bitmin,This was in my textbook
Bitmin,@Jed dude nice!! Let me know when your next game is. I wanna come watch one

Bitmin,I mean
Bitmin,its an opinion so as long as its written well it'd work

Bitmin,@Zain Don't leave without talking with me real quick please
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,"aight so if I get a switch it's ~$380, but if I get a switch and either BoTW or Odessey it's ~$420 (so basically $40 for a game I was planning on getting anyway)

which should I go for?"
Bitmin,Personally I think I would go for Odyssey
Bitmin,If you like more of a 3d platform-ish style with a more linear story
Bitmin,It's movement is fantastic and really satisfying to pull off
Bitmin,There is a lot of content in the game if you like going and collecting the moons
Bitmin,The puzzles in the game are fun and interesting
Bitmin,The capture mechanic is also really fun
Bitmin,..........
Bitmin,BotW on the other hand
Bitmin,Is more if you like an open world adventure type game with a non-linear story that you get to explore at your own discretion
Bitmin,I find the fighting very rewarding in this game but sometimes I feel that the weapons break too quickly for my liking
Bitmin,hm
Bitmin,"If you're looking for a traditional Zelda game with lots of dungeons and boss fights, there are only a handful of them in the game"
Bitmin,But I liked the shrines enough to fulfil the dungeon portion
Bitmin,I just wish there were more bosses
Bitmin,"The exploring and doing whatever you want though is the main draw for the game, collecting things to make food and potions, doing side quests, taking out hordes of enemies, completing shrines to upgrade yourself"
Bitmin,"I'm thinking I'll probably go with odessey, cause the other game I'm gonna get is xenoblade, which  will probably be good for my fix of more open world-ish stuff"
Bitmin,all the exploration stuff and the story stuff 'n stuff
Bitmin,Glad that I could help
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I'm planning on spending my entire first week's paycheck (after taxes) on games and stuff
Bitmin,"including a proper hard drive so I'll finally not be able to make the ""it won't fit on my teeny tiny hard drive"" excuse"
Bitmin,Zack make sure you get botw at some point
Bitmin,Definitely one of those games you really gotta play at some point

Bitmin,botw @Sak von Sak
Bitmin,"for me personally, i feel like oddessy loses it's charm and collecting moons becomes boring after a while. while everytime i come back to zelda i learn something new or find more shit."
Bitmin,i have alot more hours into zelda and still feel like i haven't found everything
Bitmin,while oddessy feels like a grind
Bitmin,"350 ish hours into zelda
120 ish into oddessy"
Bitmin,"xenoblade is pretty linear btw. and bombards you with sidequests up the butt that you can't beat till later, or you do so many sidequests that you are overleveled"
Bitmin,also get the dlc for xenoblade its amazing
Bitmin,I will once I'm done the main game
Bitmin,I'm with rainbow on the Mario thing
Bitmin,I didn't even beat the game because I lost interest and found it boring
Bitmin,You guys are a couple of hosers
Bitmin,ill vacuum your fucking pork sword dweeb
Bitmin,Finish Odyssey then come talk to me

Bitmin,I am significantly less rich than I was ten minutes ago
Bitmin,feelsgoodman
Bitmin,wait did you choose oddessy or zelda
Bitmin,very important question
Bitmin,ZELDA IS BETTER AND HAS WAY MORE HOURS IN IT
Bitmin,im pretty sure you didnt read the entire thing correctly
Bitmin,you missed ODDESSY LOSES ITS CHARM
Bitmin,also zelda has more content than oddessy
Bitmin,especially if you include the dlc
Bitmin,you're all too late I got odessey already
Bitmin,i can lend you zelda
Bitmin,I'm gonna get both at some point and early on I'd rather have more gameplay variety
Bitmin,oh we should exchange switch codes
Bitmin,it won't arrive till tuesday
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,I don't think Odyssey loses its charm at all
Bitmin,i meant more like. it doesnt captivate you to continue playing after you beat it
Bitmin,"i beat the main story, got like 50 more moons then got bored of the game"
Bitmin,because its the same shit
Bitmin,It did for me
Bitmin,I got all of them
Bitmin,Except like 2 because idk where they are
Bitmin,;-;
Bitmin,I got around 400 moons? i dont remember...
Bitmin,most of the moons are placed so easily
Bitmin,and served no challenge to me
Bitmin,the more challenging moons are placed so bs with no room for creativity
Bitmin,especially the darker side
Bitmin,I'm not saying oddessy is a bad game. im just saying that botw offers more. and would be the game i would recommend first.

Bitmin,Also there isn't really PvP so idk how it's pay to win
Bitmin,You can certianly buy better things

Bitmin,Hooray
Bitmin,let's go bananas
Bitmin,this man's nuts
Bitmin,I just realized that Shiz beat Westballz to get into top 64 winners
Bitmin,Bananas destroyed plup
Bitmin,"he got about 2/3 of his kills off wobbling, but almost every time it was a wobble off the back of a ton of percent from sopo"
Bitmin,It was 3 stock 3 stock 2 stock
Bitmin,wow

Bitmin,lololol at the wizzy west set

Bitmin,is anyone else seeing this

Bitmin,ENTJ here
Bitmin,I feel like im a mix between entj and entj
Bitmin,Is this personality test even good? @SWIRL GIRL
Bitmin,there's no real evidence supporting its validity
Bitmin,I just think its fun to think about
Bitmin,the big five is another personality test that has a lot more research behind it if anyone wants another test to take
Bitmin,That's the good one
Bitmin,My distributions are as follows
Bitmin,"Openness: 93rd %
Conscientiousness: 67th %
Extraversion: 98th %
Agreeablesness: 0th%
Neuroticism: 3rd %"
Bitmin,@Trapezoider What trait would make someone have a high level of skepticism?
Bitmin,Low openness
Bitmin,And possibly high neuroticism
Bitmin,Both of which run in your family
Bitmin,Which family member are you referring to?
Bitmin,Both your mother and your father
Bitmin,You also got high conscientiousness from your dad
Bitmin,Personality tests are really stupid

Bitmin,down to clown for a bit
Bitmin,is short hop needle cancel fair a thing? @Melee
Bitmin,cause I feels like that'd be pretty effective
Bitmin,I don't think a short hop provides enough airtime to both needle and do a fair.
Bitmin,it does I tested it
Bitmin,as long as you dont fast fall
Bitmin,you can do it
Bitmin,I would guess people avoid it because you can stil cc the fair while needle grab cannot be cc'd and it provides a greater potential punish.
Bitmin,no needle cancel fair
Bitmin,like threaten needles into fair
Bitmin,I've never really seen that
Bitmin,you cant needle into fair
Bitmin,or maybe like needle cancel tomahawk
Bitmin,@Max did you do thanksgiving dinner already
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,same
Bitmin,My family prefers to do it more for lunch then for dinner
Bitmin,yuck
Bitmin,after reading reddit for awhile a lot of casual/smash 4 players seem to think melee sucks because a lot of characters are unviable and the roster is small
Bitmin,but like there are more varied character archetypes than any of the other games
Bitmin,and arguable still more viable characters than sm4sh lol

Bitmin,Gay
Bitmin,Ok @Homies
Bitmin,I found out who the guy banging on my door was
Bitmin,Who?
Bitmin,So
Bitmin,little background
Bitmin,Did you kick his ass?
Bitmin,Mike yesterday ordered a new microphone on Amazon
Bitmin,And it was supposed to come in today
Bitmin,Like before 9:00pm
Bitmin,So another little background
Bitmin,We never get stuff delivered to our door
Bitmin,because we are in a building and you need a key to access it
Bitmin,and our mailbox is too small
Bitmin,"so they leave it at the front desk of the main building, and they will send an email saying that they have your package"
Bitmin,"So he gets the email from the delivery man saying that the thing is delivered, and he's now waiting for the email from the front desk"
Bitmin,It's been like 30 minutes at this point
Bitmin,so he decides to check the original email
Bitmin,and in it there's a picture of the door to our room
Bitmin,with the package on the floor
Bitmin,So
Bitmin,This guy somehow got inside of our building
Bitmin,Went to our door
Bitmin,knocked
Bitmin,and fucking BOOKED IT
Bitmin,"Like I heard the knock, got up and peered through the peephole"
Bitmin,"and there was nothing, or nobody in the hallway"
Bitmin,"Again a knock, the same thing happens"
Bitmin,"nothing, and noone"
Bitmin,So it seems like this company hired literally the Flash to deliver packages
Bitmin,because I immediately got up to check the door and nobody was in sight
Bitmin,Elusive as fuck
Bitmin,Maybe he just ducked down
Bitmin,But why would he do that
Bitmin,It's literally his job to deliver the package
Bitmin,Then again
Bitmin,Why would he run away at mach 10
Bitmin, 
Bitmin,  not fast enough

Bitmin,Ava is still doing school
Bitmin,90f124d8
Bitmin,@The Rona not allowed to buy things during December to avoid overlaps with Christmas so I've gotta wait till the 25th to either receive or buy it
Bitmin,Feels bad man
Bitmin,Yup
Bitmin,It'd be less annoying if I was in exams and it'd be a good excuse to nor waste studying time
Bitmin,But I'm working so it just kinda sucks
Bitmin,Should have pre-purchased  the game before December 
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak whatchu mean not allowed
Bitmin,ur an adult
Bitmin,with a job
Bitmin,I mean I could but I don't out of fear of familial ostracization
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,why
Bitmin,I guess me and Chris will just have an 18 day head start on you then.
Bitmin,Hell yeah
Bitmin,My Incineroar is gonna be popping off
Bitmin,My name is weird now
Bitmin,How did you do that?
Bitmin,Some random guy in the UWaterloo discrod had it
Bitmin,So I stole it
Bitmin,is that supposed to be a really big uwu?
Bitmin,I think so
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,I'm just gonna leech off people every weekend
Bitmin,Come leech off of me
Bitmin,Actually don't
Bitmin,At least not until the 18th
Bitmin,You're kinda far
Bitmin,Also I generally have an advantage from having played more sm4sh
Bitmin,I hope to be able to catch up within a month but that might be too ambitious
Bitmin,Assuming the game is fun
Bitmin,I might just not like it
Bitmin,Well see
Bitmin,Aren't you in Toronto Zack?
Bitmin,Oh are you back atm? As opposed to waterloo?
Bitmin,After the 18th I am
Bitmin,Sweet
Bitmin,Although I have non-weekend time off until the 24th
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Which characters are you interested in for Ultimate?
Bitmin,"Pichu, wolf, zelda, inceneroar are my main ones"
Bitmin,Why not pikachu?
Bitmin,Cause apparently pichu isn't awful
Bitmin,but pikachu is probably #1 in the game
Bitmin,The new Zelda looks kinda okay for once
Bitmin,"A) don't have much faith in pre release tier lists
B) when have I ever cared about how good a character is over how much fun I have with them"
Bitmin,She will probably be top tier
Bitmin,Also yeah I'm hyped for good zelda
Bitmin,I played some brawl recently and I still love brawl zelda
Bitmin,"I'm interested in Snake, Simon, Ike, Bayonetta, and Meta Knight."
Bitmin,So I'm excited for her not sucking
Bitmin,8c38e79c
Bitmin,wait
Bitmin,sm5sh is out?
Bitmin,Friday
Bitmin,Get 5mash @Trapezoider
Bitmin,they're calling it 5mash??? lol
Bitmin,how is that even pronounced
Bitmin,I have no idea
Bitmin,I just did it because Andrew wrote it the other way
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,Near the games announcement people were calling it smush
Bitmin,I prefer 5ma5h
Bitmin,"Or, if you're picky, 5mu5h"
Bitmin,I like Ultimate
Bitmin,"Pronounced ""five-muh-five-hrrrr"""
Bitmin,Like the Hebrew throat h sound
Bitmin,My switch now has internet!
Bitmin,praise kek
Bitmin,@Melee

Bitmin,Is it worth it?
Bitmin,idk kinda
Bitmin,Schlef is playing League right now though

Bitmin,@The Rona This is what I was talking about https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M77HLII/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_HamaCbMGCX7G3
Bitmin,The $10 adapter
Bitmin,Thanks buddy
Bitmin,yo kids
Bitmin,crisis averted
Bitmin,purchasing 5ma5h
Bitmin,:pog:
Bitmin,What changed your mind?
Bitmin,well the main thing preventing me was a family rule about not buying stuff for yourself during december to avoid undercutting other people's christmas gifts
Bitmin,but I just kinda asked if I could anyway
Bitmin,you could also just
Bitmin,do it without asking
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,"Wow you really didn't want to see me that much, huh?"
Bitmin,You should get better internet for christmas
Bitmin,"well if I didn't ask, I run the risk of having the game, getting it as a gift, and that being both a) real awkward and b) a wasted gift"
Bitmin,also I literally have zero control over the terrible internet
Bitmin,it has to do with the line into our house
Bitmin,It used to not be this bad
Bitmin,hey guys guess what
Bitmin,What?
Bitmin,What?
Bitmin,UwU whats this
Bitmin,"Hey guys, let's kill @Mr. Airplane"
Bitmin,"@Mr. Airplane 
Spider GF: Catches you in her web
Spider GF: 88w88 whats this"
Bitmin,this man
Bitmin,its me
Bitmin,@Max how do you asdi?
Bitmin,I hate you
Bitmin,DOn't answer him
Bitmin,hold the cstick when in hitlag
Bitmin,...
Bitmin,You dissapoint me
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,how
Bitmin,do I not press it before hand
Bitmin,holding the cstick does not require pressing a button
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,do I hold it before the hit starts?
Bitmin,you can
Bitmin,why isnt it working then?
Bitmin,but if you are not in hitstun you will do a move
Bitmin,asdi is only 1 sdi input and usually isn't enough to make a differnece
Bitmin,i mean asdi down
Bitmin,why would you want to do that
Bitmin,
Bitmin,im holding the cstick
Bitmin,but i still go up
Bitmin,What is the situation here?
Bitmin,Are you edgeguarding?
Bitmin,this is an uncle punch challenge
Bitmin,what % are you at?
Bitmin,at really low % sometimes asdi down tech doesn't work
Bitmin,well it SHOULD work cause its literally built into the game
Bitmin,I don't really know what this even is
Bitmin,
Bitmin,(that means that it isn't important)
Bitmin,That isn't what I mean
Bitmin,I don't know the situation where you are trying to use this
Bitmin,i just feel like the asdi down isnt working
Bitmin,is ALL i need to do hold the cstick down?
Bitmin,I think so
Bitmin,You could try both sticks though
Bitmin,did
Bitmin,What % are you at
Bitmin,maybe asdi just like doesnt work on my controller
Bitmin,that is important
Bitmin,max
Bitmin,its a simulation
Bitmin,it should work
Bitmin,MODS... can... be... broken...
Bitmin,try taunting
Bitmin,this one is pretty trustworthy tho
Bitmin,I'm not joking
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Maybe you are not timing everything correctly
Bitmin,I really don't know
Bitmin,you should really download this modpack
Bitmin,i wanna see how many sdi inputs you can get on the upthrow upair sim
Bitmin,i usually get 1 or 2
Bitmin,which upon doing  r e s e a r c h
Bitmin,should be enough to get out of upthrow upair p consistently
Bitmin,but I know your good at it
Bitmin,Maybe I'll get it when I go on break
Bitmin,it seems like its prolly humanly impossible to get more than 3 inputs so I guess im doing it right
Bitmin,melee is sick
Bitmin,It is definitely possible to get at least 4
Bitmin,either way im pretty sure 2 is really good
Bitmin,https://twitter.com/unclepunch_/status/992525190063099905?lang=en

Bitmin,Just leave your Switch plugged in @Trapezoider
Bitmin,It just might look like it isn't charging when it really is
Bitmin,It just doesn't have enough battery to show that it is
Bitmin,Okay I will try that
Bitmin,How long does the download take?

Bitmin,My game has an hour left
Bitmin,So im gonna play a cs go or two
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,I gotta leave at 5 PST for gym and christmas stuff
Bitmin,You gonna be on before then?
Bitmin,Yeah I'll take a brake before then
Bitmin,Are you going to be back after though?
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,Like 9-10pm pst
Bitmin,
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,90%
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Its happening boys
Bitmin,This intro song is weird
Bitmin,Are you kidding
Bitmin,That song is some fire
Bitmin,This bitches voice is annoying tho
Bitmin,D:
Bitmin,YO THERES VOICE ACTING IN CAMPAIGN
Bitmin,HYPE
Bitmin,Imagine doing the campaign to unlock characters
Bitmin,Isnt that what I have to do
Bitmin,nope
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,how do I get all the dudes?
Bitmin,"Play a game and do nothing but run and jump for 20 minutes then play games with 1 life and sd at the beginning. After every game, change the language."
Bitmin,this gets all characters in 2-2.5 hours
Bitmin,the fastest known method
Bitmin,Im just gonna play campaign on easy. That sounds really unfun
Bitmin,you will take way longer to unlock characters
Bitmin,See you next week when you unlock everyone
Bitmin,I dont need everyone
Bitmin,Just falcon
Bitmin,I think you will actually need to play story mode more than once
Bitmin,I think you get Falcon pretty early
Bitmin,Easy
Bitmin,I don't recommend playing the same character in multiple games
Bitmin,As in
Bitmin,Not in the story mode
Bitmin,Doing the method that Max described
Bitmin,There is a set order that you unlock the characters in doing that
Bitmin,Falcon plays completely different then he does in melee
Bitmin,This Ost is some fire
Bitmin,Okay I might do the thing
Bitmin,Story mode sux because theres ITEMS
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,If you insist on falcon I remember he is unlocked early
Bitmin,You still get to fight the characters by doing the other method
Bitmin,So it's not like you're just sitting there unlocking mans
Bitmin,You gotta beat them first
Bitmin,whats the first thing I gotta do
Bitmin,Run/ jump around for 20 minutes in a match
Bitmin,don't fight just move
Bitmin,plug in 2 controllers so the cpu doesn't attack you
Bitmin,set the rules to time 20 minutes
Bitmin,I dont have a second controller rn. Can I just not attack and try to live for 20 mins?
Bitmin,If I take dmg is it over?
Bitmin,You realise that a joy con is a controller
Bitmin,you can take damage
Bitmin,it is just annoying
Bitmin,Are you using a gamecube controller Andrew?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,Then use your joycons as a second controller
Bitmin,ez clapper
Bitmin,Already started the time
Bitmin,Not worth easy
Bitmin,wavelanding kinda sucks
Bitmin,max
Bitmin,I accidentally used the thing from kirby
Bitmin,I didnt damage the cpu
Bitmin,do i need to start over?
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,What do you mean you used the thing from kirby?
Bitmin,the three piece ship
Bitmin,I accidentally picked up all 3 and activated it
Bitmin,no dmg though
Bitmin,there is no need to start over
Bitmin,All you are doing is increasing an invisible steps taken and times jumped counter
Bitmin,As long as you continue to do those things everything is fine
Bitmin,"so just keep jumping
?"
Bitmin,literally it's totally fine
Bitmin,What do I do after game one
Bitmin,just move around and jump
Bitmin,just run and jump for 20 minutes
Bitmin,after the time runs out you will get to unlock ness
Bitmin,"then play 1-stock games and as soon as you get a character, fight em then change the game language and then play more 1-stock games until you get everyone"
Bitmin,then change the language and change the rules to 1 stock
Bitmin,in system settings or game settings?
Bitmin,game settings
Bitmin,do I kill the ai during sudden death or let myself die?
Bitmin,@Ultimate
Bitmin,Doesn't matter
Bitmin,so now just change language after every stock
Bitmin,Dope
Bitmin,Yup
Bitmin,can i just go back and forth on languages?
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,dope
Bitmin,can I interupt this process to play online
Bitmin,I have no idea
Bitmin,Or do I have to do the move thing again to start unlocking through language switcthing
Bitmin,just suck it up and play mad one stock games
Bitmin,It probably doesn't matter
Bitmin,I wanna play you before I have to go chris
Bitmin,Sauce up
Bitmin,Join up

Bitmin,"Gotta study. I've got finals next week, but I'll let you know when I'm on a break and available."
Bitmin,wow it's really easy to get to elite smash
Bitmin,man tho there's some dicks
Bitmin,I just got stuck in a free for all and two of the people just flat out teamed
Bitmin,I almost 1v2'd them
Bitmin,and then they just waited for timeout
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak

Bitmin,Dude AZ is a dope ass state
Bitmin,@Ultimate

Bitmin,But my mans tryna play
Bitmin,Cant let a fella down
Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,You are going to be waiting a long time lol
Bitmin,hello
Bitmin,ARE YOU GUYS HYPED FOR FINALS?
Bitmin,I'm hyped to be finishing school
Bitmin,but tests are stressful
Bitmin,"THATS WHY YOU GOTTA BE HYPE, YOU CANT BE STRESSED IF UR HYPED"
Bitmin,I fell asleep
Bitmin,Is it too late?
Bitmin,You fell asleep in 20 minutes during csgo?
Bitmin,No it's not too late
Bitmin,Sauce up that lobby
Bitmin,I can't finna join voice
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,Why not?
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane unblock me
Bitmin,Nope
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,nope
Bitmin,One final down three to go
Bitmin,Looks like I'm changing mains in ultimate
Bitmin,Why?
Bitmin,Corrin's moves can't hit short characters
Bitmin,they go right over their head
Bitmin,I'm going to be a Shulk player now
Bitmin,does shulk not suck ass in ultimate?
Bitmin,pog
Bitmin,I've seen people placing him high on tier lists
Bitmin,no im not saying you're wrong
Bitmin,im just like
Bitmin,pog
Bitmin,Max most of corrins best moves hit short stuff
Bitmin,Down tilt
Bitmin,Pin
Bitmin,Nair
Bitmin,Bite
Bitmin,Shulk just does all the things I liked about Corrin better
Bitmin,That wasn't the only reason for switching
Bitmin,"But just so you know I meant that it was hard to kill short characters because fsmash and bair, which seem to be the two moves that kill the earliest, either don't hit short characters or are hard to land."
Bitmin,Young link is still gay confirmed
Bitmin,He can't be gay though
Bitmin,He wears pink
Bitmin,and gay men don't wear pink
Bitmin,the math checks out
Bitmin,the numbers dont lie
Bitmin,@Ultimate Anyone down to play?
Bitmin,10 mins then yes
Bitmin,just join up when ready
Bitmin,hot damn kingston sm4sh put out a PR for the game's entire lifespan and I juuuuust barely slid in
Bitmin,"and it's really funny for me looking at everyone above me and being like ""yup, yup, yup, better than me, yup, yup"" for everyone ranked above me... except andybulb"
Bitmin,which I'm basing entirely off the one time I fought him and booped him with captain falcon after not going to tournaments for like a year
Bitmin,I'm sure he's probably done really well around that but oh well
Bitmin,I'm still pretty happy I made it on this despite barely only really playing for like a year
Bitmin,of the like four-ish years that there was a scene
Bitmin,How did a Little Mac get so high
Bitmin,Isn't Little Mac like really bad
Bitmin,we had the best little mac in ontario
Bitmin,second best in canada
Bitmin,he 2-0'd the guy who was (at the time) #3 in ontario a few times
Bitmin,"dude the whole PR up until #7 is low tier with the exception of DK who's like, mid tier"
Bitmin,"the character spread is like
mid, low, low, low, low, low, very high, high, high, top, high, mid/high, low, mid, mid/low, top, top, low, low, low"
Bitmin,we were a weird city
Bitmin,is kingston just all zacks?
Bitmin,@Ultimate
Bitmin,Yee
Bitmin,After how bad I got roasted by max and Ava I'm quitting ultimate

Bitmin,Imagine being so conceited you cant even recognize when you are about to get raped
Bitmin,I 3 stocked you multiple times
Bitmin,Can you guys hold off on the match till I get home so I can get in voice chat while you play and listen to the shit talk live?
Bitmin,Were we playing the same game 
Bitmin,Ok hold on though
Bitmin,I also want to be in voice for that
Bitmin,we gotta schedule this match
Bitmin,Somebody has to do WWE voice casting
Bitmin,but I thought he returned the game
Bitmin,You guys can spectate the match
Bitmin,You cant return games
Bitmin,it was a joke
Bitmin,You can't return games you bought from the eshop
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,oh yeah spectating is a thing in this game
Bitmin,Also I want to play y'all at some point
Bitmin,HELL YEAH BOIS
Bitmin,since when is a low tier match between two bad players deserving of all this hype?

Bitmin,Also you've got a garbo internship if you get no vacation
Bitmin,Unless it's a 4-month one
Bitmin,How can you be in debt at 18

Bitmin,"and a whole bunch of things were basically just like
""You thought it was an email from your coworker, but it was hooded hackerman""
and a graphic of some random dude in a shirt and tie would peel back and this dude would be behind it"
Bitmin,I mostly just get a kick out of the idea of a generic hacker as a dude in a black hoodie with bright red sunglasses
Bitmin,eating dinner at 6 is like the most standard time to eat dinner
Bitmin,3:30 and 4 are very early y

Bitmin,i think people who dont like it are just focussed too much on the wrong aspects of the game
Bitmin,that's subjective
Bitmin,i mean
Bitmin,not really
Bitmin,It completely is
Bitmin,that's actually the truest thing you could say about anything
Bitmin,if you dont like ow youre just a fat gay idiot

Bitmin,because your focusing on the wrong aspects

Bitmin,Ooh thats a big spicy
Bitmin,Thank
Bitmin,"pretty much all of the anime streaming sites suck these days. They're all slow, low quality, and full of ads. You gotta torrent them yourself if you want quality."
Bitmin,I caNT ANYMORE
Bitmin,BECAUSE I USED TO PIRATE ALL THE TIME and now my ISP will rape me if I pirate again
Bitmin,
Bitmin,BIG sad
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,It was so dumb
Bitmin,I haven't had any issues with anime torrenting
Bitmin,I pirated BOTW to emulate
Bitmin,but that didnt matter because my MAJORAS MASK ROM was the final strike
Bitmin,lol stupid
Bitmin,How much do you have to pirate to get warned by your ISP?
Bitmin,but if anyone is curious the current anime torrent site I know of that works well is nyaa.si

Bitmin,FRAN Playing Overwatch - Twitch Clips
Bitmin,Jeff Kaplan destroys players below Diamond - Clipped by akbierly
Bitmin,I really think that this argument is just false
Bitmin,metas in ow apply to basically every skill tier above like silver
Bitmin,like yeah other things can work in lower tiers
Bitmin,but if people just randomly decided to run goats they would still probably win
Bitmin,metas do not only rely on executing specific strategies but also the natural synergy between characters and the inherent strengths of characters
Bitmin,like dva is just really really good so you are more likely to win with a dva than without at basically every elo
Bitmin,yet the entire ow community seems to agree with Jeff here and uses this to argue about game balance like what
Bitmin,yea i can probably agree with you was Jeff just saying this relating to something else or what? @Mr. Airplane
Bitmin,he basically just said meta doesnt matter at plat and below
Bitmin,and then on reddit people were like 'yeah meta doesnt even really matter unless you're in like the top 5% of players'
Bitmin,Yeah that's retarded
Bitmin,"hmm i mean i think your both probably right but think it's more like gold and to a greater degree silver and below, because at that rank people just don't have any fundamentals so they rarely can make use of playing the character or the comp to their maximum potential. I do admit if a team were to play goats they would be more effective than just picking random hero's due to the innate usefulness of goats. Metas do apply but not because the players are good or can make use of the meta comp but more just due to the comp it self just being better than what they would pick normally that's probably my perspective"
Bitmin,bruh i literally just said that
Bitmin,read my wall of text
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,smile

Bitmin,Oh
Bitmin,"kingston melee PR's out for this season, I can say with confidence I would have been on this if I was in kingston, based on the handul of tourneys I went to"
Bitmin,Where would you place yourself?
Bitmin,"I haven't played some of these people, but I'm say at least in the 7-9 range, possibly 6"
Bitmin,Also where would you place me?
Bitmin,Your region seems to lack good fox players.
Bitmin,"for the people I have played: 0-3 with dayman, 2-3 with momba, 0-1 with boo, 1-1 with deep in thot, 3-0 with sasquatch, 0-2 with dog, 1-0 with whom"
Bitmin,"I don't know honestly, I haven't gotten to play people all that much this season"
Bitmin,or you cause our connection's pretty bad
Bitmin,When you say 0-1 or 2-3 is that set count or game count?
Bitmin,sets
Bitmin,Are you going to bed soon or do you want to try some ultimate tonight?
Bitmin,D&D till bed
Bitmin,"but also I'm going to bed early no matter what, I'm starting to get a little sick so I want to make sure I get a good night's sleep"
Bitmin,"also, if it was in games, how would I be 0-1 or 1-0 or 1-1?"
Bitmin,Friendlies or a forfeit.
Bitmin,I guess forfeit could make sense
Bitmin,but I wouldn't count friendlies
Bitmin,I remember you saying something once about a guy reporting a score as 0 - -1
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Gottem
Bitmin,Nice job
Bitmin,Now I just gotta beat ceroas
Bitmin,fuck him up
Bitmin,We should do an Ultimate tourney when Kameron gets the game
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,@Ultimate
Bitmin,Probably with a character ban system like with melee
Bitmin,Also @Trapezoider don't be big gay
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Oh yeah he also has the game
Bitmin,Tournaments for this game will be cooler then our previous ones because we can host an arena for it and all the sets can be watched by the other players.
Bitmin,Im selling my switch mang
Bitmin,sorry
Bitmin,
Bitmin,unless zelda 2 gets announced
Bitmin,Just give it to Jed so he can play
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Or don't be big gay
Bitmin,I can imagine you selling your switch and then the very next day they announce the new Zelda game
Bitmin,YO 4TH
Bitmin,yeet
Bitmin,THATS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BUT DESERVED
Bitmin,@Trapezoider Don't sell yet
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,you gotta play more fam
Bitmin,mmm I was expecting like 5th
Bitmin,and had hopes of 4th
Bitmin,you thought maybe they would put you below jarek
Bitmin,yeah but that was fake I guess
Bitmin,I wasn't going off stats on that i was just worried he'd be biased in the decision time
Bitmin,but he wasn't
Bitmin,noice
Bitmin,yo I just did my math placement test and tested into math 250/260 thats good right?
Bitmin,what is math 250/260
Bitmin,cause its gonna depend based on the school
Bitmin,like what is the name
Bitmin,College algebra and trigonometry I guess?
Bitmin,Generally 2xx courses are second year so that's probably good
Bitmin,111 is college algebra at chemeketa
Bitmin,"It's GCU though, I imagine they have a different naming scheme? Unless you are secretly a GOD at math :D"
Bitmin,If it's the same as chemeketa that's calculus
Bitmin,And stats
Bitmin,I think they usually have similar naming systems
Bitmin,I thought so too but then I compared my community college to the state college I'm transferring to and everything was WACK
Bitmin,They literally had a whole website for translating which courses were equivelant between the schools
Bitmin,True
Bitmin,Maybe I lied
Bitmin,Idk the projected math course for me was 154 but the test said 250
Bitmin,Go on their website and find out which math that is
Bitmin,I'm curious
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,You might be a math God?
Bitmin,"Also Chris, thanks for help on math last year buddy. I used to hate it but now that I'm getting into the higher level stuff I'm really enjoying math!!!"
Bitmin,Applications of college algebra

Bitmin,that was an absolute shitshow
Bitmin,Rip
Bitmin,0-2?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,against some garbage players
Bitmin,at least I've still got melee tomorrow
Bitmin,I really want to try ultimate competitively but I can't justify buying a switch
Bitmin,Just yoink Andrew's
Bitmin,He is selling it though
Bitmin,Exactly
Bitmin,So just yoink it
Bitmin,
Bitmin,andrew's selling his switch??
Bitmin,"Yeah, he's big gay"
Bitmin,wow what a retard
Bitmin,260 for 3 games and switch so issa good deal
Bitmin,And I did just get a $250 bonus but like I have school to pay for soon
Bitmin,buy it and resell the non ultimate games
Bitmin,Good idea
Bitmin,They are all digital though
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,Rip
Bitmin,Ok I don't know if this is good advice so take it with a grain of salt
Bitmin,Yeah you got school to pay for
Bitmin,But you also gotta treat yo self sometimes you feel
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,Plus you got your entire school period to make money to pay for it
Bitmin,This is also true
Bitmin,"And in reality if everything works out the way I have planned I'll only actually be owing 3,000 out of pocket"
Bitmin,That ain't too too bad
Bitmin,Fingers crossed I can transfer to the Chipotle newar my school so I can get the reimbursement for the rest
Bitmin,Yeah it's hella good
Bitmin,Just don't come to me if this turns out to be a bad financial decision
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Also don't you have to pay for online monthly though?
Bitmin,Yeah but it's only $20 a year
Bitmin,Oh
Bitmin,We might also start a frostbite family plan
Bitmin,Plus if you do a family plan with the peeps in here it becomes a lot less
Bitmin,Ay nice
Bitmin,For example I'm only paying $8
Bitmin,@Ultimate Anyone?
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,Botw and Mario are physical

Bitmin,since his defensive game isnt that strong
Bitmin,he has to approach
Bitmin,"Well I did pretty bad in pools, but at least there's an amateur bracket"
Bitmin,On the flip side I won the rock paper scissors tournament
Bitmin,How many people were in that?

Bitmin,They knew you were planning on OSU I thought?
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,but just in case I dont get accepted
Bitmin,@Homies
Bitmin,anyone taken linera algebra?
Bitmin,Me
Bitmin,Okay
Bitmin,Vector Quantization
Bitmin,Im trying to collapse a series of audio channels into a single 1 dimension vector. My research keeps pointing me to a method called vector quantization
Bitmin,I have the basics of what a vector is from this video
Bitmin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs
Bitmin,"Vectors, what even are they? | Essence of linear algebra, chapter 1"
Bitmin,"I imagine many viewers are already familiar with vectors in some context, so this video is intended both as a quick review of vector terminology, as well as ..."
Bitmin,but as soon as things get funky i get CONFUSED
Bitmin,You got any insight?
Bitmin,When do things get funkyÉ
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,Also I'm not sure I know what vector quantization is
Bitmin,So my author talks about vector quantization then Markov Chains?
Bitmin,Are these linear algebra things even???
Bitmin,URRRGg
Bitmin,❤
Bitmin,"If it has to do with vectors, yes"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Markov chain sounds like it's just a way of seeing sequences of possible events
Bitmin,Vector quantization is definitly a linear algebra concept
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane Might know more?
Bitmin,Bird boi!!!
Bitmin,Come hither
Bitmin,I have scooby snacks 
Bitmin,Hmm
Bitmin,A quick Google search reveals that vector quantization is also a statistics concept
Bitmin,For creating a probability density function
Bitmin,Well that explains why im confused
Bitmin,I know nothing about probability density functions
Bitmin,Im only in my first stats class this term
Bitmin,You're definitly going to learn about them there
Bitmin,Probably more towards the end though
Bitmin,We just covered measures of variance / the normal distribution
Bitmin,True
Bitmin,Do probability density functions get pretty difficult
Bitmin,because so far the class is easy
Bitmin,Not really
Bitmin,Cool
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Math is so cool
Bitmin,Agreed
Bitmin,markov chains is indeed linear algebra
Bitmin,but i learned that like half a year ago i dont remember any of it lol

Bitmin,Give it to him
Bitmin,:gachiBASS:
Bitmin,She sent me a snap saying let me suck your dick this morning
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Then sent another one saying it was meant for someone else but it didn't make sense
Bitmin,And she just sent a snap wearing glasses reflecting FUCK ME on her computer screen
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,What do
Bitmin,What is she 1-10?
Bitmin,Mmmm face is like 4-5
Bitmin,Yikes
Bitmin,Yeahhhhhhh

Bitmin,Hows the body?

Bitmin,"Like, fuck her from behind"
Bitmin,Ya dig
Bitmin,I'd say around 7 ‍♂️

Bitmin,^
Bitmin,I just poked into the g6 stream for ultimate and they're literally in winner's round of 2048
Bitmin,this tourney is enormous
Bitmin,I think this might be larger that any sm4sh tourney ever
Bitmin,"to compare, melee's in winner's round of 512"
Bitmin,Jesus
Bitmin,"I checked smashgg, melee's got a bit over 1100 total, ultimate at 2099"
Bitmin,@Zain 
Bitmin,hyyype some random samus beat army
Bitmin,let's go violence
Bitmin,So I started a CS GO team for esea open last year
Bitmin,And I quit after our first season together
Bitmin,And I didn't realize it
Bitmin,But they all still play together and have gotten pretty good
Bitmin,is this a  legacy?
Bitmin,Rip leaving the team
Bitmin,Nah staying good at CS is hard. I had to practice hours everyday just to be decent in ESEA. Those dudes are so fucking good at the vidja.
Bitmin,Bro I got sent out of class because hats are distracting
Bitmin,Backstory hats aren't allowed at my school except Fridays and this one teacher says we can't wear them in her class
Bitmin,tf?
Bitmin,you still in highschool?
Bitmin,But I'm pretty sure school ruling supercedes her so I'm tryna talk to the principal about it but he can't be found
Bitmin,Yeah I'm a senior this year
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,It's really gay
Bitmin,"Yeah, that's big dumb"
Bitmin,dude i literally wear hats 24/7
Bitmin,i look so bad w/o one
Bitmin,"depending how much hair I have, I either look super dorky or like a hockey douche so I usually don't wear hats"
Bitmin,but the no hats thing has always been a dumb rule
Bitmin,Glad your parents are paying a fortune for you to not be allowed to learn because of a fucking hat
Bitmin,
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak
Bitmin,Yo I finally watched original FMA
Bitmin,Then rewatched FMAB
Bitmin,"Gotta say Im still digging FMAB, although FMA had a dope ending"
Bitmin,I haven't seen the original
Bitmin,and I honestly didn't really like fmab all that much
Bitmin,it just felt super generic and the second half was basically like 6 episodes of story and a fuckton of padding
Bitmin,Really :0
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,it's my very own Unpopular Anime Opinion
Bitmin,(TM)
Bitmin,Certainly
Bitmin,I actually agree with Zack
Bitmin,
Bitmin,The last 20 episodes are a lot of ACTION
Bitmin,But I still adore the show
Bitmin,I love the soundtrack
Bitmin,I've learned most of it on piano
Bitmin,"action can rarely hold something up on its own, and FMA has pretty uninspired choreography"
Bitmin,and there's just so much random stuff that felt like they threw it in without having much of a reason beyond padding the episode count
Bitmin,Except for this fight scene... I think even you can agree this is top notch

Bitmin,yeah that was a decent fight
Bitmin,but for a show with as much fighting as there was nothing particularly standout
Bitmin,like you look at most decent shows with a lot of fights and there'll always be at least a few crazy awesome fights and FMA just kinda doesn't
Bitmin,"you look at like, 
Fate/ - saber vs lancer, kiritsugu vs kirei, shirou vs archer, etc etc etc
KLK - every ryuko vs satsuki fight but especially the first, the second proper ryuko vs nui fight, the episode and a half boat fight, etc etc etc
MHA: All might vs nomu, deku vs todoroki, etc etc etc"
Bitmin,even some shows with basically zero fighting have really damn good fights every now and then
Bitmin,see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2QkKGrTd6Y

Bitmin,Richter goes TAKE THIS when he brings out the jesus water
Bitmin,ah I see
Bitmin,Why would you play Richter over Simon?
Bitmin,there's a few matchups where it's better cause of some weird property of the jesus water
Bitmin,that is the literal only difference between the two
Bitmin,Yeah but isn't the difference Simon's holy water has the fire property and Richter's doesn't
Bitmin,I don't really know how it works honestly
Bitmin,I think it's better to have one in some matchups? not sure
Bitmin,Why would you not want to have the fire property
Bitmin,or it might be that it only matters in some matchups
Bitmin,"cause it's all the same hitboxes, they both do the thing where you're eating a whole bunch of hits if you're in it"
Bitmin,it's just literally the type of damage
Bitmin,which has some weird niche effects

Bitmin,he just spins around
Bitmin,that aint cool

Bitmin,why watch melee when you could watch slap city
Bitmin,good question
Bitmin,one of my friends so badly wanted to go out to genesis for slap
Bitmin,but he's broke af
Bitmin,I'm still salty that slap city took stream priority over rivals
Bitmin,slap's actually pretty fun
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,"but like rivals isn't side event and it has a $13,000+ prizepool"
Bitmin,man's like top 2 fish in canada

Bitmin,I think 48
Bitmin,there's usually more people in loser's than winners
Bitmin,"there's a solid sm4sh set going on right now (zackray, the guy who's been dominating japan) vs sonix (hella wifi warrior), and it's a great set but I'm really upset that both commentators are saying 'utilize' instead of 'use'"

Bitmin,They want to separate the crappy players
Bitmin,I've got the opposite atm
Bitmin,I gain like nothing and lose a lot of I lose
Bitmin,maybe its cause im playing a new character

Bitmin,@TheRainbowpixelz How does the game make money?
Bitmin,Do you start with all characters or do you have to buy them?
Bitmin,All but 2 characters are unlocked
Bitmin,All legends are sorta balanced.
Bitmin,I'd yet because  I've only played it for less than an hour
Bitmin,Ttk is mid to high. Guns feel super satisfying  to shoot
Bitmin,Game makes money by cosmetic  microtransactions. Since the game is ftp it gets a half pass
Bitmin,If all it sells are cosmetics that is amazing to me
Bitmin,As long as it aint loot boxes
Bitmin,Fingers crossed that ea doesn't pull an activision
Bitmin,It is loot boxes
Bitmin,As long as the majority of the gameplay content is not locked behind a paywall I'm game
Bitmin,smh
Bitmin,I do not care even a little how my character looks so I don't care how they do the cosmetics
Bitmin,^

Bitmin,and you're just adding to the bunch
Bitmin,no one cares about your annoying little crew
Bitmin,"fuck off ava you don't do shit in here, we kick the people after we are done playing with them unless they're chill and we want to keep playing games with them"
Bitmin,which I believe is the point of this server
Bitmin,I actually do talk in here semi-frequently thank you very much
Bitmin,and why even invite people if you literally plan to kick them
Bitmin,just make a group DM?? duh
Bitmin,"Damn just calm down boys and girls it's all good where just here to have some fun in the end, no need to start shit if you guys have some complaints just talk to me in DM instead of starting a flame war in chillin or don't do whatever you want lol."

Bitmin,But later tho
Bitmin,I am ready to refine my new main
Bitmin,I got family over
Bitmin,Who is your new main?
Bitmin,Young Link
Bitmin,Why?
Bitmin,"Because while I really like Cloud and saw great results with him against  people worse then me, you need to hit most of your limits with him in order to beat people that are as good as or better then you. Limit is not something you can really combo into, so it requires a read to hit. Getting reads like that has always been something that I've been bad at compared to everything else. Young Link does not require reads in the same way to do well and also has a really awesome combo game, good projectiles, and a better recovery."
Bitmin,@Ultimate Lets do a tournament this weekend
Bitmin,ok i am here
Bitmin,i am at home for the weekend

Bitmin,"Its kind of unfortunate that the one part of our body that must always be kept exposed, our eyes, is so close to the one part of our bodies that must absolutely be protected, our brain."
Bitmin,it makes it harder to damage something that would cause us to lose some or all of our vision
Bitmin,cause there's fewer connecting parts that could be damaged
Bitmin,also faster reaction times
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane  :-(
Bitmin,Did not think of the first one but I have considered the second point. I'm just not sure how much faster it would be.
Bitmin,"not much, which was why I brought it up as more of an afterthought"
Bitmin,but generally most of our sensory stuff is on our heads so it might be some of that
Bitmin,I dunno honestly
Bitmin,I'm guessing more of my original first point
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,Brb
Bitmin,A lot of sensory stuff is also in the spinal cord
Bitmin,Most reflexes that we do come from it
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,You here???
Bitmin,Can hear?
Bitmin,Also I do think that the speed is important enough
Bitmin,the spinal stuff is mostly for body senses something -> body reacts without mental processing stuff
Bitmin,Correct
Bitmin,so I guess that could work
Bitmin,as a counterpoint
Bitmin,hm
Bitmin,The brain still gets information though
Bitmin,just later yeah
Bitmin,Just to let it know what it's doing
Bitmin,For posture and stuff
Bitmin,so I think I'm gonna stick with the protecting the connecting bits theory

Bitmin,oh ew
Bitmin,that's lame
Bitmin,whoever wrote that is stupid
Bitmin,
Bitmin,sorry @Trapezoider @Jed i ended up having a long winded discussion with my friends about killing babies
Bitmin,Abortion?
Bitmin,I hope
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,killing living babies
Bitmin,You mean that New York law?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,just in general
Bitmin,wait what did new york do
Bitmin,You can kill a newborn through neglect and it will be legally considered abortion
Bitmin,that's... not a good law
Bitmin,that's a pretty terrible law
Bitmin,Wait what the fuck
Bitmin,That is horrible
Bitmin,Who
Bitmin,The fuck
Bitmin,Thanks for at least being reasonable on this
Bitmin,aren't you not even allowed abortions past a certain point in the pregnancy
Bitmin,Voted for that
Bitmin,because it starts getting enough brain to be at least somewhat conscious
Bitmin,Different states can decide the point at which abortion is allowed
Bitmin,how in the fuck
Bitmin,"is a completely born, living baby"
Bitmin,What argument could there possibly be for this law???
Bitmin,not considered alive enough that that's a motherfucking problem
Bitmin,I have no idea how this passed
Bitmin,This is actually rediculous. Do you have a source for this?
Bitmin,let me find one real quick
Bitmin,Thanks crazy extremist left
Bitmin,nah our argument was more like theoretical
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Perhaps some of the things I heard were exaggerations but an abortion when there should be a delivery is still pretty sad
Bitmin,Not ruling out what I said as impossible though
Bitmin,Yeah q
Bitmin,based on that's it's just legal until birth
Bitmin,Still crazy either way
Bitmin,which is still a little sketchy
Bitmin,but not anywhere near as crazy
Bitmin,I think the after birth thing was a law currently being debated in Virginia based on what I read
Bitmin,I think that's actually discusting still
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,but in comparison it's not as bad
Bitmin,They are pretty equal
Bitmin,depends on the timeframe of letting neglect kill your baby counting as an abortion
Bitmin,It could be only seconds separating the time of death
Bitmin,"Even if you don't want it, just put it up for adoption"
Bitmin,"neglect would normally be like not feeding it, so I don't think it'd be seconds"
Bitmin,I'm pretty sure the neglect thing real or not was to be done only right after birth
Bitmin,seconds would be the doctor fucking up
Bitmin,"but yeah, still quite fucked up"
Bitmin,If you don't make a baby breath it can suffocate in seconds
Bitmin,I know someone who is mentally disabled because the doctor couldn't make him breath soon enough
Bitmin,"wouldn't have thought of that as neglect, but I dunno how the law looks at it"
Bitmin,I was thinking neglect being parental
Bitmin,anything else is just the doctor not being fast/good enough
Bitmin,"you do understand nobody carries the baby up to full term and then decides at the last second, the law is put in place for babies that will die soon after birth due to debilitating complications"
Bitmin,still a weird way of handling it
Bitmin,idk i think its perfectly fine
Bitmin,in the end its the parents choice
Bitmin,I guess the choice of the child doesn't matter then
Bitmin,"well i mean the ""child"" isnt actually like  a person yet"
Bitmin,so
Bitmin,they dont have one?
Bitmin,It's still a living breathing human being
Bitmin,Not everyone sees personhood as starting at the same time
Bitmin,it's not like they can make a choice at that point in life
Bitmin,i mean its not like you're offing a person who has lived a life and had experiences
Bitmin,and it's basically assisted suicide
Bitmin,which is a totally different argument
Bitmin,that kind of makes it worse
Bitmin,its like im deteling a game save that didnt have an data on it not like im deleteing a 100% completion run
Bitmin,You are denying them the choice
Bitmin,that I don't feel like having right now cause I'm real tired and should probably get to sleep and also I don't know my own stance on it
Bitmin,Would it be sadder to see a 5 year old die who has had no chance at life or a 100 year old with a life fully lived
Bitmin,"it's basically: yes you're denying them the choice, but also you're making the choice to doom them to a short life of misery"
Bitmin,both of which are shitty options
Bitmin,"regardless, I'm going to sleep"
Bitmin,goodnight
Bitmin,i mean both are about the same if you ask me?
Bitmin,i mena people die
Bitmin,shit ahppens
Bitmin,Yeah but not always purposefully
Bitmin,That's like saying it's alright if I murder my neighbour so who cares?
Bitmin,well an unborn baby =/= your neighbour
Bitmin,your neighbours is like actually a person
Bitmin,"""people die all the time"""
Bitmin,max said 5 year old vs 100 year old
Bitmin,idk where that argument was going but i was answering it
Bitmin,look i dont wanna argue about it cause nobody is gonna change their opinion about anything and itll just end in people being grumpy so ima drop it
Bitmin,I mean we don't really get grumpy from political debates here but I understand why you don't wanna argue
Bitmin,i cant tell tone is this like an offhanded roast or a genuine comment
Bitmin,Genuine comment
Bitmin,I don't know if everyone already knows or not but plup got into summit
Bitmin,You are denying those people the opportunity to exist
Bitmin,There is the potential for a life full of wonderful conscious experiences

Bitmin,@SWIRL GIRL come play big gai
Bitmin,In like 10 minutes
Bitmin,Jk more like 25
Bitmin,Fuck you
Bitmin,
Bitmin,jk tho
Bitmin,
Bitmin,since no one knows what time human becomes a human it's safest to assume that they are a human at conception so you can't abort anything if you could determine at what time a person becomes a person you wouldn't have this argument when we have something as valuable as life on the line i would rather be safe then sorry that's my position. @Max @Sak von Sak @Eric Working From Home @The Rona
Bitmin,I think abortion should be legal up to 2500 weeks
Bitmin,Yo that's 48 years
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,exactly
Bitmin,Also I agree with Zain
Bitmin,But in all seriousness I agree with Zain as well
Bitmin,"Considering that your brain is pretty much one of the first things that begins development, I would argue you ""become a person"" pretty early on"
Bitmin,i mean even if you are arguing that it is a person and not an anomaly (im probably using that word wrong) the value of a life isnt that high imo
Bitmin,"An anomaly would be something that isn't standard, so I don't really know what you mean by that?"
Bitmin,A fetus is a pretty normal thing
Bitmin,uhh
Bitmin,hello boss?
Bitmin,considering a zygote contains all the information necessary for a complete human to form I think that is when you are human
Bitmin,If there was a completely painless and cost free way to remove a zygote from the womb and grow it externally without harming the mother I think there becomes no moral arguement for abortion
Bitmin,change my mind
Bitmin,@SWIRL GIRL
Bitmin,@Bitmin
Bitmin,are you guys still here?
Bitmin,I got yoted?
Bitmin,i mean what would even be the point of going to those lengths to create a person
Bitmin,That's what plan B does right?
Bitmin,Because it is better to live than to never have the chance to exist
Bitmin,there are so many people in the world and we are so insignificant that to think we actually matter is narcissistic and delusional
Bitmin,And creating more concious minds is the moral imperative
Bitmin,like if i died tomorrow would it matter
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,Yes it would
Bitmin,Because you matter
Bitmin,i care about u dober
Bitmin,thats the poiont in tryna make
Bitmin,nobody matters
Bitmin,u matter to me
Bitmin,But that's not true
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Thats not true
Bitmin,Every life matters. Conciousness is the only thing that matters. Maybe the universe doesnt assign us any meaning at birth
Bitmin,"If you have the mindset that you don't matter, then you probably won't ever do anything that matters. But if you live your life with the mindset of doing something that matters and had an impact somewhere, you probably will achieve that to some scale"
Bitmin,But it could be said that humans and more generally conscious creatures are the ONLY thing that matters
Bitmin,"i'm all for killing babies, but i don't like letting women have a choice"
Bitmin,^^
Bitmin,^^^
Bitmin,Pinned a message.
Bitmin,so in DnD spiders have a strength of 2
Bitmin,meaning they can life 30 pounds (reduced to 15 due to their size)
Bitmin,a single spider can carry 15 pounds
Bitmin,imagine you wake up in the night and see a spiuder yoinking your newborn
Bitmin,Crawls into your womb and just carries them out
Bitmin,you have made me feel a feeling i never want to feel again
Bitmin,Good
Bitmin,the argument of a single person mattering or not mattering isn't even related to abortion
Bitmin,btw
Bitmin,I want you to think about that for the rest of your days
Bitmin,@Zain we tlakiung about spiders now

Bitmin,repost:
Bitmin,I feel like fusion getting demolished by meh teams without boombox validates my opinion that they're backline actually carries them
Bitmin,the same thing happened when neptuno was sick in playoffs
Bitmin,What are you talking about
Bitmin,owl
Bitmin,"on friday, we had an office lunch thing where our manager took us all out for lunch, I ended up sitting next to the manager and one of the full timers and got to listen to them spend the entire lunch talking about weed"
Bitmin,Is weed legal where you live?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,its legal in all of canada
Bitmin,it's legal canada-wide
Bitmin,but you need a license to sell it and only a tiiiiiiny handful of places have gotten some yet
Bitmin,so most available weed is still illegal
Bitmin,well illegal to sell not illegal to be in possesion of right?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,you can also grow your own
Bitmin,how many plants?
Bitmin,but only up to a maximum of like 4 plants or something
Bitmin,I think in Oregon its 5
Bitmin,Why would there be a plant restriction?
Bitmin,my family almost ended up growing weed for one of my mum's friends who is basically incapable of not killing houseplants
Bitmin,"it's basically to make it so you can't grow and sell easily, you have enough for a household who are all using but not really enough to sell it"
Bitmin,or at least I think that's why
Bitmin,plant restriction so the entire population of canada doesnt get addicted
Bitmin,but 5 plants if a fuck ton lmao
Bitmin,weed's not addictive tho
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,i know but
Bitmin,How big is a weed plant?
Bitmin,sketchy dealers will sometimes lace it with addictive stuff but if you grow your own it's just weed
Bitmin,"I honestly have no idea, but I think they grow pretty low to the ground so I'd assume not big"
Bitmin,"they're closer to, y'know, weeds than regular plants"
Bitmin,i thought the idea is that individuals mass growing weed doesnt screw with the price
Bitmin,that makes more sense honestly
Bitmin,I mean oregon has too much weed now lmao
Bitmin,oregon has to grow it for the other states 
Bitmin,You are allowed to plants per person over 18 in a household
Bitmin,oh damn not bad
Bitmin,we might have been growing 6-8 plants then
Bitmin,Oh the age is probably 18 to smoke there huh?
Bitmin,"I would have thought 19, same as drinking age, but I dunno"
Bitmin,Eief way still better than 21
Bitmin,You can't even vape or smoke tobacco products till 21 in Oregon now

But this morning I accidentally slept in so grandpa came in to wake me up. I had morning wood (an erection in the morning that is caused in your sleep) and I had kicked the covers off during the night so I was laying there naked, with a hard-on (how embaressing!!). Grandpa quickly went out of the room and we weren't talking because it was awkward. Then later on today I was wanking off in the bathroom (which doesn't have a lock) when I thought my grandpa was outside. He walked in just as I was ejaculating and groaning with . One day doesn't get much more embaressing than that!! How unlucky. My grandpa and I haven't talked for seven hours now. What should I say to him?"

Bitmin,@Trapezoider @The Rona Po3 up
Bitmin,@Ultimate anyone?
Bitmin,oh also @Mr. Airplane @The Rona do you guys wanna do another nuzlocke at some point? I'm in a bit of a pokemon mood and we never did get around to doing gen 1
Bitmin,Played a bunch already today sorry. I played some Ike as a part of my journey to try all the top tiers and also went on a huge winning streak with puff (who ended up higher GSP than Ike lol).
Bitmin,pfft nice
Bitmin,Can confirm that puff dittos are still really boring
Bitmin,I got one
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak hell yeah buddy
Bitmin,Then we should do gen 7
Bitmin,still gotta finish gen 7
Bitmin,but yeah
Bitmin,You should do that
Bitmin,Then later we can do gen 8
Bitmin,
Bitmin,What gen is the newest one?
Bitmin,They announced 8 today
Bitmin,See the pokemon I posted earlier today
Bitmin,Those starters are super ugly
Bitmin,they're not stellar
Bitmin,TAHNK YOU
Bitmin,I kinda like the water one tho
Bitmin,Nobody here likes my boy Grookey 
Bitmin,water and fire are aight but grookey is so bad it drags htem down with it
Bitmin,he's second best but not really particularly notable
Bitmin,fingers crossed for kameron liking the fire one and then if we do gen 8 we all get the starter we want
Bitmin,He's literally a baby monkey
Bitmin,So cute
Bitmin,I the the fire one too
Bitmin,I think he is the best of the three but still kinda bad
Bitmin,Grookey is the best I mean
Bitmin,Also @Trapezoider @Eric Working From Home PO3 in 5?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak im down

Bitmin,Report: Amazon will pay $0 in federal taxes this year
Bitmin,"Amazon won't pay a cent in federal taxes this year, according to a report by a watchdog group.  The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy(ITEP) reports that Amazon, in fact, is getting a $129 million rebate, meaning they will effectively pay a negative one percent tax rate."
Bitmin,Yikes
Bitmin,Big business privilege
Bitmin,Have not read a ton on this but I think they helped write the tax laws that made this possible
Bitmin,Why do we let this happen
Bitmin,Cause we don't want them moving to a different country and losing jobs
Bitmin,But it's still really not a good way to go about it
Bitmin,i mean it's free speech dude the speech that says heres 10 million dollars lets write some laws deff not a bribe btw
Bitmin,lol

Bitmin,My chances of proving myself just flat out don't exist
Bitmin,Cause I'm not good enough to beat top 20 people without playibg really well and getting a decent helping of luck and they're the only people I fucking play

Bitmin,There is no exact place because it is also partially based on win rate

Bitmin,im not huge on draft tho
Bitmin,not a fan of commander but I would be down for draft or sealed

Bitmin,ah okay
Bitmin,never been to a prerelease
Bitmin,they are fun
Bitmin,I went to the magic origins one
Bitmin,i liked that set
Bitmin,I think that this format would be best because I doubt we will get enough for draft.
Bitmin,Prerelease format works with any player count
Bitmin,fair
Bitmin,We could pick an old classic set like Innistrad or Zendikar

Bitmin,Will you have mega free time tomorrow?
Bitmin,I'll have a computer then hopefully
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,Not sure if you are interested but I would be super down to play some Magic the gathering on tabletop
Bitmin,Any amount would work for sealed but we need at least 6 for a proper draft
Bitmin,I don't think playing a constructed format would be a good idea
Bitmin,The way magic works on tabletop would make it complicated and inconvenient
Bitmin,@Zain Do you know how to play magic or would you be learning?
Bitmin,I would play sealed or draft
Bitmin,@deleted-role anyone down?
Bitmin,"@Homies We are playing magic the gathering on tabletop simulator tomorrow. Feel free to come and join whether you have played before or are new to the game as anyone who has played can teach you before we start. For those who know what this means, we will be playing either sealed or draft as constructed is inconvenient to play on tabletop."
Bitmin,why dont we just play rn
Bitmin,I guess I could try on my laptop
Bitmin,he has his laptop
Bitmin,tabletop sim is not too resource intensive
Bitmin,which is better than his pc anyways
Bitmin,We could at least teach Zain tonight
Bitmin,not sure if everyone would want to play on this short notice
Bitmin,@Zain interested?
Bitmin,Let me grab my mic headset and I'll join
Bitmin,make sure you have tabletop installed

Bitmin,I just dont understand why he posted all these images about data
Bitmin,I think because his name got leaked.
Bitmin,I mean he has already told people in this discord
Bitmin,Now everyone knows
Bitmin,Wait what is it
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Zade
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,The people he told he lied to.
Bitmin,Zade is fake news
Bitmin,Did he tell you his last name?

Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane of course you wanna play rivals now that I'm not at home
Bitmin,I could play keyboard kragg on shitty wifi though 
Bitmin,JED
Bitmin,FOCUS ON YOUR PAPER
Bitmin,!!!!
Bitmin,Nah I'm about to finish my project
Bitmin,Then the paper
Bitmin,I'm also writing a paper
Bitmin,The alternative energy paper
Bitmin,"After researching it, I'm not really sure why people like to hype up wind and solar, as they seem like the two worst options."
Bitmin,Nuclear >
Bitmin,Solar efficiency has a moores law and will be superior in the coming years
Bitmin,Because they are renewable
Bitmin,Sure they aren't very good
Bitmin,But they are effective in the long run
Bitmin,I'm saying that there are better renewables
Bitmin,Also solar technology will only improve
Bitmin,the basic idea is that it's a one-time cost you can stick pretty much wherever
Bitmin,hydroelectric is probably best but you can only stick it in certain places
Bitmin,and become cheaper while still harnessing energy at a higher efficiency
Bitmin,you can just shove solar panels on a roof and get a decent amount of energy
Bitmin,Utilities companies will never accept that
Bitmin,They will lose a lot of revenue
Bitmin,they can't entirely stop you as far as I know
Bitmin,They can lobby against it
Bitmin,I wrote another paper on that
Bitmin,even on personal property and stuff?
Bitmin,damn that's dumb
Bitmin,If you have solar pannels you have to sell the energy back to the grid
Bitmin,"Or if you use the power yourself, and don't use the grid"
Bitmin,You have to pay for the power that you would have used
Bitmin,well
Bitmin,that's dumb
Bitmin,indeed
Bitmin,I am fairely sure that is how it currently works atleast in Ontario
Bitmin,Hooray for lobbying
Bitmin,"I know at my house we just pay for an alternate provider who gets their stuff from renewable sources, which is an option but I don't think they generate enough total energy to supply a particularly large number of people"
Bitmin,"basically we just take energy and they pump that much more into the grid (and pay a bit extra, so we also pay a bit extra)"
Bitmin,lol marss camera tricked himself
Bitmin,To me it looked like he did neutral B instead of down B
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane

Molly: lv49 Metagross (died to a crit)
Boomer: lv48 Wailord (died to a crit)
Snek: lv46 Dragonite (got ice beam'd)
(also brought 3 garbo pokemon)

Progress: Agatha three mons down"
Bitmin,Will Chris finally win one?
Bitmin,almost certainly
Bitmin,we introduced some new rules for elite four to prevent stalling and it kinda depends on how far kameron makes it
Bitmin,aight chris just won
Bitmin,Why would you ever want to stall in a race?
Bitmin,"if everyone else loses, winning strat is to just grind till you're overleveled and then make it further"
Bitmin,so we changed the rules so the first person to reach the elite four doesn't have to make it as far to win
Bitmin,

Bitmin,of the who whats sit?
Bitmin,The google thing?
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,It was just revealed  yesterday and I was reading about it
Bitmin,seems mega stupid
Bitmin,Yeah but you said it took like 20 gb per hour or something crazy right?
Bitmin,Supposedly
Bitmin,I didn't look too deep into it
Bitmin,But its supposed to stream the game from the cloud
Bitmin,Which I think means it runs the game from the cloud
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,SO I think the  idea is you dont need a device to process it you can just play from anything that can stream it
Bitmin,or rather you dont need a good device
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,So I found a little more

Bitmin,isn't your hair already rlly short?
Bitmin,everytime he gets a haircut it looks like its only cut back by 1cm
Bitmin,kameron likes his hair long because he loses 1 cm of pingo for every 1 cm of hair
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,its a 1:1 hair to pingo reverse relationship
Bitmin,"f(p) = p * -h
Where f(p) is a function of the relationship between
p (pingo length)"
Bitmin,h (hair length)
Bitmin,does that mean that if I have hair my pingo is negative

Bitmin,It would respond to everyones comment with a paragraph of text
Bitmin,"Heres what it said to me saying 
""In the beginning man made memes."""
Bitmin,"OUTPUT:
The internet was meant to let us enjoy those memes because we saw them. In their mind man made memes was as much an expression of man's self to be seen as any other. This is a sad state of affairs and we see it again and again in the work of art.When a new art forms is created men take what they need to reproduce the original. They put in what they can, this will bring the art back, and this will lead to new art forms. This works like ""We need to love something and enjoy it"" but it is an extension of the original. It is the same with art.> 
This process creates new forms of artistic expression. This is what the ""songs of history"" are all about. It creates new forms of expression. I would much like to hear about these great works that are being created through this process. They are all in this world. People like you that love art will listen to the work of these artists and create a great work of work. I would like to hear about some of these great works through your community. Here's what you can do to help. Take a look. A man made meme> 
This is how the creator of these works came to get his name. This is an interesting thing. If you don't know this guy, the Internet is really the most amazing thing ever to happen to the internet. People have created a new art form to be reproduced in and around our public spaces. Now all we see is this guy being made a poster and that's it.> 
You know this meme is great and you just want to help a few people. Here are some links to help you out. This is why we are so hard at work to create the memes we deserve. If you want to know more on this and more great works about this we're here to help.> 
The Art of Making> 
And this is a must get for everyone at work. If you are one of the lucky few you will get a copy of The Art of Making. We've put together this guide to help you make sure everyone has a copy of The Art of Making. We hope it helps you too!

Bitmin,?
Bitmin, 
Bitmin,Wrote a lab report on the BMR of mice
Bitmin,We is BMR?
Bitmin,Big Mega Roast?
Bitmin,Basal metabolic rate
Bitmin,What were the conclusions of your lab results?
Bitmin,Basically how much energy your body needs to run at rest
Bitmin,A mouse uses about 7.625cal/hr/g
Bitmin,So 7.625 calories per hour
Bitmin,per gram of body weight it has
Bitmin,How does one calculate these metabolic rates?
Bitmin,In laymans terms please
Bitmin,❤
Bitmin,"I'll tell you later, I'm in my lab now"
Bitmin,@here how do i get rid of this bullshit in the corner
Bitmin,No idea it seems like a new 'feature'
Bitmin,hover over it
Bitmin,and there should be an X
Bitmin,in the corner
Bitmin,THERES NO X
Bitmin,then you lost gg
Bitmin,guess im just gay
Bitmin,problem solved guys
Bitmin,its a bug
Bitmin,not a feature lol
Bitmin,Too bad you have the gay now
Bitmin,@SWIRL GIRL ive got that shit too
Bitmin,howd you fix
Bitmin,prob just restart ?
Bitmin,i didnt fix it
Bitmin,waiting on discord to fix it
Bitmin,Results from survey
Bitmin,n = 91 (so far)
Bitmin,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot surgeon to perform a critical surgery. (Heart Transplant, Gastric Bypass, Spinal Poliomyelitis Surgery, Surgical Ventricular Restoration ETC...)"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot to perform basic Nursing duties (pre-post operational care, taking: pulses, temperatures, blood pressures, monitoring and administering medication and intravenous infusions)"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Do you feel an Artificially Intelligent Robot could provide emotional support during recovery?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Do you think a ban should be placed on Artificially Intelligent Robots preventing them from entering the healthcare workforce to prevent medical professionals from being ousted from their jobs?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Would you trust the diagnosis of an Artificially Intelligent Doctor?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Looks like I was in the minority for those last three
Bitmin,It appears the general consensus (If this sample is representative at all) is that a reasonable portion of people are comfortable with SOME form of A.I assistance in healthcare
Bitmin,same
Bitmin,for what chrius said
Bitmin,@Trapezoider I think a resonable interpretation of this data would be if A.I assistance in healthcare was proven to be a benifit based upon evidence people would be comfortable in using it on themselves that's why a mojarity would say maybe i think
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,What
Bitmin,There isn't really enough data on this for people to have informed opinions
Bitmin,"For me, as someone who knows how far the academic research has advanced, I can see how application of A.I is superior in many different medical domains  when compared to the best human Doctors. For the layman however, they don't have knowledge of the ground breaking developments  to answer these questions knowledgeably"
Bitmin,yea i think the reason there are so many maybes is because either the data is not there or people don't know enough about the data
Bitmin,yea exactly
Bitmin,that's why i think if people knew what maybe you did there would a lot more yes's rather then all the maybes but i could deff be reading a lot more into the data then i should be
Bitmin,I think the sample size is too  small to be too confident in our answer
Bitmin,"As far as sample sizes go, this is pretty good"
Bitmin,i mean this is deff not a good representation of the population my dude at least not this server
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,Im gonna see if I can send it to people at work
Bitmin,I could easily get 800 responses from this plant alone
Bitmin,I think of all the questions a consensus should be reached about the first question. Human Surgeons make mistakes and some of those mistakes are sometimes fatal. It would be universally better to have ai or nano bots or whatever performing that part of the medical process. Thats the part people fuck up the most on lol\
Bitmin,Agreed
Bitmin,Now the A.I community needs to figure out how to explain to the public the work they are doing
Bitmin,It should be simple lol guess not
Bitmin,It's not simple to explain this stuff in a way that people trust
Bitmin,unfortunately the reason for that is cause generally people are uneducated on the subject
Bitmin,Even though I'm demonstrating empirically superior analytics at my Internship (compared to our business analyst team) I am encountering strong opposition to Machine Learning
Bitmin,Precisely
Bitmin,It's gonna take a lot of time to shift the zeitgeist on this issue
Bitmin,Thanks Alot Stephen Hawking scared everybody in the 90s
Bitmin,@Trapezoider stop using big words u stupid idiot
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,ya dumb
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,but like unironically using words like that makes you sound like you carry around a pocket thesaurus
Bitmin,He does
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Its some fucking r/iamverysmart shit
Bitmin,I think that was an appropriate use of the word for the actually meaning that would not have  a good substitute to get his point across
Bitmin,"""zeitgeist"""
Bitmin,how bout popular opinion
Bitmin,actually zeitgeist does not even make sense in that context
Bitmin,because it refers to something from the past
Bitmin,and this is the present
Bitmin,so popular opinion actually makes way more sense
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,
Bitmin,It doesnt only apply to the past lol
Bitmin,Did you read the definition at allÉ
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,well we don't know what the zeitgeist of the current time is until the current time is over so it kinda does
Bitmin,I cant read
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"also the word is usually used to refer to historic timeframes, example ""the 60s"""
Bitmin,Reading hurt my pee pee
Bitmin,"""demonstrating empirically superior analytics"""
Bitmin,this just word salad
Bitmin,I dont wanna get hung up on semantics but and im not saying the way he said things was good or bad but i think it is fine to use big words to describe specifics if it makes sense
Bitmin,im just saying that if you talk that way dumb people are gonna think you're smart and smart people will probably think you're dumb
Bitmin,Fair
Bitmin,"I just hate the negaive look on ""big words"" use them if you can and they make sense"
Bitmin,i would change that to use them if you need to for it to make sense
Bitmin,'big words' typically will have very specific use cases
Bitmin,Or just don't overuse them in everyday speech
Bitmin,using them whenever you can will make your speech more confusing
Bitmin,Like an essay or a paper etc.
Bitmin,even then
Bitmin,But it real life its like trying to up the word count
Bitmin,you shouldn't use big words in a essay just to sound smart
Bitmin,you should use them if they're meaning aligns with the message you are trying to convey
Bitmin,In an essay big words can be used effectively to describe the 'seriousness' of the situation
Bitmin,eh
Bitmin,But again there's a limit to that
Bitmin,i dunno about that
Bitmin,Just don't overdo it
Bitmin,Hey Kameron
Bitmin,How about you eat cock
Bitmin,there is a difference between big words and formal language
Bitmin,Zeitgeist was the appropriate word
Bitmin,Literally false
Bitmin,it clearly wasn't
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Read it and weep
Bitmin,It clearly was
Bitmin,"""Current believes and ideas of the time"""
Bitmin,of the time
Bitmin,i.e.
Bitmin,The past
Bitmin,2010's is a time period
Bitmin,I am conducting this survey now to see how things evolve over time
Bitmin,"yeah but its not even a ""defining spirit or mood"""
Bitmin,10 years from now the zeitgeist around A.I and A.I in healthcare will be entirely different
Bitmin,fear of ai is not a defining spirit of the 2010s
Bitmin,Yeah but we as people in the present have a poor understanding of the majority consensus on topics
Bitmin,It is in my circles
Bitmin,Fear of A.I is one of the most discussed topics of the people I work and hangout with
Bitmin,My intellectual life is dominated by this topic
Bitmin,Man andrew you're really smart
Bitmin,Man Kameron you're a really big asshole
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Ill make that asshole gape a little wider
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"But Kameron, what I was saying about big words in an essay was essentially the idea you said"
Bitmin,"I'm sorry if you feel I'm tossing together a word salad, but this is the world I live in. Bullshit meetings and emails and fucking retarded standardization of everything"
Bitmin,I just didn't know how to express it
Bitmin,hence the quotations around the word seriousness
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,Everyone at work ACTUALLY emails and talks like that
Bitmin,Andrew have you heard of the theory of great filters as connected to the Fermi Paradox?
Bitmin,Yes I have
Bitmin,I think it is entirely likely that surviving AI could be the final filter that nothing passes
Bitmin,Maybe A.I is the bottleneck that prevents most civilizations from becoming intergalatic
Bitmin,This is why I'm entering the field. I want to ensure we build safe A.I and don't destroy everything we care about
Bitmin,I think that's the idea
Bitmin,We develop alternate realities
Bitmin,That we live in entirely
Bitmin,i.e. they are so advanced that we think it's reality
Bitmin,eg. the Matrix
Bitmin,That we kind of just forget about progression and stuff
Bitmin,Who knows where all this is going
Bitmin,All bets are off the table
Bitmin,"Go read Perfect State by Brandon Sanderson, it's basically that idea"
Bitmin,Sorry let me phrase that in words kameron will like
Bitmin,Also its only like 60 pages
Bitmin,I think that finding and increasing the genetic basis for IQ in humans would be a far safer approach to increase our scientific progress then creating AI.
Bitmin,all gambling activities have after careful consideration been labeled not available as actionable items in the workplace environment
Bitmin,?????????????????????????????
Bitmin,That's what I call a fucking word salad
Bitmin,much better
Bitmin,holy shit
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,I disagree
Bitmin,It's an interesting take on how a matrix-like system could work in a way beneficial to the happiness of mankind but at the cost of other stuff and all around its a solid story
Bitmin,"Andrew, what is your view on transhumanism?"
Bitmin,I don't think you can get enough of an increase in intelligence from using CRISPR to edit genes. Brains are about as big as they can be due to birth canal size. I think the way to go is high bandwidth brain interfaces. A third neo-cortex in the words of Kurzweil
Bitmin,"I think transhumanism is dogmatically adhered to too much, especially by silicon valley type people. Transhumanism is a good goal to aim for, but with some asteriks* to ensure we don't accidentally destroy ourselves (genetically engineering superhumans---->super bug that wipes out everyone etc..)"
Bitmin,I'm off lunch break boys. Have a nice day. Thank you for keeping my mind busy with fun discussions ❤
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane @The Rona  I think that when ever your trying to communicate with people it's probably more importent that the people you're communicating with understand the message you want to convey over saying it as efficetly as possible. If we work off this premise then the best way to communicate is to use words that almost everyone will understand thus making your message hopefully easier to understand for the people your communicating with agreed?
Bitmin,zain ur late we already finished this discussion
Bitmin,no but i wanna be cool too

Bitmin,I love this emo man
Bitmin,wow the voices in this game are actually obnoxious
Bitmin,"these are probably the worst characters, voice-wise"
Bitmin,or maybe I'm just used to being annoyed at them cause I play both of them
Bitmin,"Whenever I play ultimate with Ava or with her in the room, she always comments on how annoying Ike is because he makes so many war cry type noises."
Bitmin,ike's voice is way better than this
Bitmin,that is true
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,i think if I had to listen to those voices for 5 minutes i would blow my brains out
Bitmin,they're not that bad
Bitmin,they're like the two worst anime voice archetypes
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,extremely squeaky little girl and edgy man child
Bitmin,@Homies come chill
Bitmin,there was some debate in the queen's fgc discord over who the edgiest character in the game is between that guy and this dude:
Bitmin,I agree with Kameron
Bitmin,And I watched it for like 5 seconds
Bitmin,@The Rona when u get back
Bitmin,those are some AWESomE VoicCE ACtTORES
Bitmin,look the game's fun

Bitmin,yeah so did I
Bitmin,this is roughly 1/3000 of the download speed we're paying for
Bitmin,Can you sue?
Bitmin,and 1/15 of the upload
Bitmin,if it lasts longer than a little bit we can probably yell at them until we get it fixed or refunded
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"internet is alive, for now"

Bitmin,How was the flight @Trapezoider
Bitmin,So it was red eye
Bitmin,2 hours of sleep over the last 36 hours. Check in isn't till 4 so we are derping around
Bitmin,"Should we go to universal studios, SeaWorld,  or disneyworld"
Bitmin,??
Bitmin,Universal studios is also pretty sick
Bitmin,They got some nice rides
Bitmin,Universal is the best of those three options
Bitmin,"You gotta go to adventure Island though, that's where the better rides are (it's a part of Universal studios)"
Bitmin,Also it's the one with Hogwarts
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,adventure island is really cool
Bitmin,the main park is more movie focussed while adventure island is more ride focussed
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,but I agree its probably the best of the three
Bitmin,honestly disney is kinda boring and its usually mad crowded
Bitmin,If you like roller coasters
Bitmin,Adventure Island has probably one of my favourites
Bitmin,in the Hulk ride
Bitmin,That ride is fire as fuck
Bitmin,that ride is siiiiick

Bitmin,I just saw a shiniqua raw drink whipped cream
Bitmin,I've done it
Bitmin,it's really good
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,eaten raw whipped cream
Bitmin,What is the difference between that and regular whipped cream?
Bitmin,it hasnt been cooked
Bitmin,"I'm pretty sure he either means
a) non-whipped cream that you're supposed to whip, or
b) just straight whipped cream without putting it on anything"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I have done both of these things
Bitmin,the first was honestly much less exciting than the second
Bitmin,i think @Trapezoider was referring to whipping cream which is hella gross to drink and is not the same as whipped cream
Bitmin,whipping cream > raw buttermilk
Bitmin,especially if you're not expecting the buttermilk
Bitmin,So
Bitmin,Did you drink whipping cream
Bitmin,just a bit
Bitmin,or just whipped cream by itself
Bitmin,stop drinking things alone that are supposed to be ingredients in other things
Bitmin,I have done some terrifying things with whipped cream
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"in a relatively normal, food-related way"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,fuck y'all
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Not when there's whipped cream involved
Bitmin,especially when theres whipped cream involved 
Bitmin,fuck y'all

Bitmin,I like that

Bitmin,plus perfect shielding projectiles got better
Bitmin,"Zack should be happy, Mewtwo is probably the most buffed character of the patch."

Bitmin,come into voice
Bitmin,"so yesterday at work I was talking about danganronpa with one of the other interns, and I tell him that I've been taking a bit of a break from danganronpa 3 cause I'm pretty sure at least one of my favourite characters is gonna die and I don't feel like going through that right now, he asks me who my favourite characters are, I tell him my two favourites, and on the second one he literally goes

""Oh I remember when he dies!""

I'm now playing again and man just died."
Bitmin,i bored
Bitmin,I'm down to do stuff once I'm through this bit of danganronpa
Bitmin,that'll probably be at least an hour though
Bitmin,You favorites always die
Bitmin,"yes, they sure do"
Bitmin,I still have one left
Bitmin,and they are extremely suspicious
Bitmin,This is why you don't tell people who your favorite characters are
Bitmin,If your favorite doesnt die then you cant pick good characters to favorite
Bitmin,Sylki that's so bm of that guy what the heck !! So much for a spoiler alert
Bitmin,yeah kinda
Bitmin,"it totally is, I'd be mad"
Bitmin,oh I am
Bitmin,"but also that whole chunk of the game I played today was really, really good"
Bitmin,so I'm less upset than I was before just cause it put me in a better mood
Bitmin,even though one of my favourite characters died
Bitmin,ooh that's a nice way to look at it
Bitmin,also I would have been more upset if the character hadn't been raising death flags left and right for 90% of the game
Bitmin,I just kinda assumed he wasn't gonna make it and honestly I'm shocked he survived this long
Bitmin,haha just don't get attached to characters like that
Bitmin,you can't just not get attatched to characters
Bitmin,danganronpa's good at what it does
Bitmin,no I'm joking I feel ya
Bitmin,i should probably play that at some point
Bitmin,do eeeet

Bitmin,"@Max 
1) I should just run back instead of shielding all the time, running backwards is really good
2) I need to focus more on not getting hit
3) I think when I am at mid percents I go  for risks thinking I won't die but characters in this game can kill at like 0 so I should stop doing that"
Bitmin,All solid points
Bitmin,@Ultimate anyone down?
Bitmin,I guess I'll play some more

Bitmin,didnt win a single game
Bitmin,and the people i played weren't that great
Bitmin,my first set I brainlessly approached bowser and got up b'd outta shield for like 5 stocks straight
Bitmin,once I stopped being dumb it was too late
Bitmin,then I played a villager
Bitmin,my palu got 3 stocked cause I dunno what to do vs fair/bair
Bitmin,then I went bowser
Bitmin,almost beat him but I sd'd at 40
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I just suck at this game
Bitmin,
Bitmin,chris howdy pogu
Bitmin,
Bitmin,why do I throw so hard in tourney when I play so well in friendlies

Bitmin,i dont get tilted during tournaments
Bitmin,I really dont
Bitmin,thats whats weird
Bitmin,ok you need loss-of-focus-proof tourney nerves
Bitmin,try listening to music?
Bitmin,maybe
Bitmin,theres just no friendlies setups at our fests
Bitmin,so i get cold
Bitmin,"find something that suits the mood you're looking for - a lot of people go for intense stuff to hype themselves up, I go for more chill stuff to keep myself from getting titled or overly aggressive, it kinda depends what you're looking for"
Bitmin,also are there setups pre-bracket?
Bitmin,we had very few setups today 
Bitmin,I just gotta grind dude
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak @Max LETS PLAY LATER

Bitmin,^
Bitmin,??
Bitmin,I want the same context as you
Bitmin,I just looked all these people up and they're all ugly as hell
Bitmin,Fact
Bitmin,projared is a video game youtuber thats done stuff with game grumps. his ex wife exposes him for cheating with holly who used to be married to ross from game grumps. ex wife implies that it all started around the same time holly and ross got divorced
Bitmin,Also his dick pic got leaked apparently
Bitmin,I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Bitmin,Summer break starts now
Bitmin,@SWIRL GIRL monkaS
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Scott the woz better anyways
Bitmin,i like when he talks about video games
Bitmin,Yes quite
Bitmin,Also @Max  fight me later
Bitmin,
Bitmin,okay
Bitmin,No summer for me :-(
Bitmin,MonkaS
Bitmin,Pourquoi ?
Bitmin,Taking classes all summer
Bitmin,PorkAy
Bitmin,I have no more summer breaks
Bitmin,ever
Bitmin,But still time 4 gaymes
Bitmin,"I spent my last one working, will be spending this one working, then I graduate"
Bitmin,Same ^
Bitmin,I feel your pain Brother
Bitmin,Just become a teacher
Bitmin,Factz
Bitmin,Summer for the rest of your life
Bitmin,"maybe, but also no"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,kids are terrible
Bitmin,No money lel
Bitmin,If teaching payed better I totally would do that
Bitmin,it pays well in canada
Bitmin,I really enjoy teaching people things
Bitmin,Maybe in the states you don't make a lot
Bitmin,I would totally do adjunct professor ship
Bitmin,"not obscenely well, but pretty damn well"
Bitmin,Canada is real good
Bitmin,But getting tenure is hard AF
Bitmin,you can also teach grade school
Bitmin,easier to get into
Bitmin,kind of
Bitmin,I would want to teach highschool
Bitmin,cause at least in toronto the teacher's union is a mess
Bitmin,Fuck elementary
Bitmin,I remember I once wanted to teach english
Bitmin,and then I started editing people's essays
Bitmin,Gg
Bitmin,and I realized I could not look at high school-level essays for the rest of my life
Bitmin,I also realized that basically no one cares about english in high school
Bitmin,Gotta hit up that math / science
Bitmin,I've peer proofed some of my friends work before and holy hell some people don't know how to write/spell
Bitmin,"we got to choose from a huge number of damn good books to read and do a few essays on, including Oryx & Crake and Watchmen, I think other than a few people who read Watchmen because comic book I was the only person in the class who actually read the book"
Bitmin,which our teacher was well aware of and kinda roasted people for which was funny
Bitmin,but they can't actually do anything about it
Bitmin,and I think as a teacher I wouldn't take that very well
Bitmin,"In my English class, we have to do peer review for every essay and after peer reviewing 6 essays I can agree that most people don't know how to write. What amazes me is when people don't even properly follow the assignment instructions."
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,most people consider english a filler course and don't bother putting in anything more than the minimal required effort
Bitmin,What's funny is how much they are gonna get fucked for that poor skill
Bitmin,More than math I have to write so many proposals and emails
Bitmin,Well I try to get an A in everything. Both because it makes getting in to the school you want more likely and I'm just a tryhard at everything by nature.
Bitmin,Not being able to take control of the written word is such a burden
Bitmin,2 years into college and I still have a 4.0 
Bitmin,I've ended up being saddled with handling like all the writing for all the interns at my office
Bitmin,As long as I get above a b I don't really care but when it comes to my job I'm a tryhard
Bitmin,I don't even understand half the stuff I'm doing write ups for
Bitmin,"That is with a math every year, 2 Biology courses, and 1 chemistry course."
Bitmin,If only jobs check GPA
Bitmin,he's going for actual college tho
Bitmin,which sure as hell check gpa
Bitmin,"I also am going to try for a scholarship to save my parents $25,000"
Bitmin,that too
Bitmin,man US college is pricy
Bitmin,FactZ
Bitmin,that's almost as much as my 4-year degree plus four years of housing (including the very pricy year in residence with a meal plan)
Bitmin,Yaw bruh
Bitmin,actually since it's in USD it's probably more
Bitmin,Im lucky I got 2 years free
Bitmin,My community college is like $900 as semester though so that's pretty cheap
Bitmin,yeah but it's community college so you kinda get what you pay for
Bitmin,"Professors are a mixed bag. I've had some great ones and some terrible ones. Student body is what you would expect from the price, most people seem far below my social class."
Bitmin,Lmao imagine having your parents paying for your college
Bitmin,They planned on doing it so why would I complain?
Bitmin,technically my grandpa's basically paying for my education cause he left a ton of money for it in his will but he's still alive so he's just kinda paying most of it now anyway -_-
Bitmin,I'm not planning on going to a 4 year school anymore
Bitmin,also most people can't afford to put themselves through college on a part-time job
Bitmin,especially not in the US
Bitmin,"What are your plans, Jed?"
Bitmin,Too fucking expensive even with a bunch of scholarships
Bitmin,"Prolly community college, I'm not sure if I'm gonna stay at home or move somewhere"
Bitmin,just come to canada for school
Bitmin,although we do charge extra for foreign students so it's probably not much cheaper
Bitmin,I might try and learn a trade or something not totally sure yet
Bitmin,I could have a job with John deer in Montana if I wanted to move out there
Bitmin,ok I just checked and international students pay like triple the domestic tuition
Bitmin,maybe don't come to canada for uni
Bitmin,at least at queen's
Bitmin,"it's like:
one year of eng degree, domestic: 7k
one year of eng degree, international: 23k"
Bitmin,That's about as much as my future school I think
Bitmin,the domestic or the international?
Bitmin,Yeah that's about the same as gcu before scholarship
Bitmin,International
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,oof
Bitmin,Gcu was gonna end up being 11k a year
Bitmin,Too many people go to college anyway
Bitmin,"that's eng tho, which is one of the pricier ones"
Bitmin,I think that only smart people who care about learning should go
Bitmin,"If you are just going to go, get C's, and skip class a lot why bother?"
Bitmin,C's get degrees
Bitmin,"cause the degree makes it easier to get a job, and as the saying goes, ""C's get degrees"""
Bitmin,dammit chris
Bitmin,you beat me
Bitmin,Maybe post-acceptance they do
Bitmin,For me I still need the A
Bitmin,What do you call the guy who got a C in medical school?
Bitmin,A doctor
Bitmin,Doctors
Bitmin,Exactly
Bitmin,Why get an A when I can get B's and C's and earn money while going
Bitmin,Being in Machine learning means I have to keep up on scientific papers and research constantly
Bitmin,My education doesn't end in college
Bitmin,I was mainly saying I wish college was less essential for life so it could be an option for smart people to specialize in a technical field.
Bitmin,I mean it's not gonna matter in 30 years
Bitmin,None of us are likely to be better than computers at anything
Bitmin,Good luck getting a science job on a high school degree
Bitmin,max that's what non-undergrad degrees are for
Bitmin,I know
Bitmin,College is still a minority pursuit
Bitmin,The average person doesn't attain higher education
Bitmin,"Smithy's guide to success
1. be pressured to go to school so you don't end up being a loser
2. major in something you've always been interested in
3. become overwhelmed because no one prepared you for real life
4. lose all joy and motivation
5. ignore your self-loathing
6. have multiple breakdowns
7. drop out
8. join the rat race
9. seppuku when robots take our jobs"
Bitmin,fool proof
Bitmin,Love it
Bitmin,Whats seppuku?
Bitmin,I think he means suicide
Bitmin,sudoku
Bitmin,It's the Japanese suicide
Bitmin,oh yeah you have to be japanese
Bitmin,I'm pretty sure that isn't actually how you say suicide in Japanese
Bitmin,For their honour if I'm not mistaken
Bitmin,@Feral Nebula
Bitmin,I mean just a different term
Bitmin,what?
Bitmin,Jisatsu?
Bitmin,Not the word for suicide
Bitmin,suicide in japanese
Bitmin,it is
Bitmin,My word is?
Bitmin,yes jisatsu
Bitmin,idk anything about seppuku or whatever you said
Bitmin,
Bitmin,okay so thats a specific suicide
Bitmin,what were you guys even arguing about

Bitmin,How much does my protein have to weigh
Bitmin,A lot
Bitmin,Big protein
Bitmin,Large aminos
Bitmin,I hope you all are doing well
Bitmin,:-)
Bitmin,Today is kind of a work mess
Bitmin,"At like 5 my manager gives me a task, passes me over to another guy to get more details. From the details I realize any solution like what he wants is gonna be extremely gross code. I do a bit of experimenting and realize there is no way to do it without rewriting a huge portion of the backend, so I ask both the guy who explained what I should do and my manager for clarification. Both had since left the office and gone offline on slack. In desperation, I reach out to the other guy who knows about the bit I'm working on (who is literally on his way to the airport) to ask for help, he suggests a less awful solution, I go ""great, but I don't have access to that code, can you give me access?""  That was fifteen minutes ago. He is presumably busy doing real life things and will not be getting back to me. This was implied to be a somewhat urgent task."
Bitmin,-- Tldr -- I'm kinda fucked because I got an urgent convoluted task and i don't have access to the code and everyone who might be able to help is gone
Bitmin,Pinned a message.

Bitmin,I'll explain later its kind of complicated
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Now
Bitmin,if you join voice I'll explain but I don't want to type it
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"The issue was deciding to do win a game with the character to advance, first person to win a game with every character wins. Basically we hit a point where we were both on the last of our bad characters and realized whoever won that would win the whole thing cause they'd move on to their mains and dominate for the rest"

Bitmin,@Sak von Sak

Bitmin,
Bitmin,@Homies games or somethin
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,hurray one of my melee matches got reported wrong
Bitmin,so a guy I cleanly 2-0'd is reported as having beaten me
Bitmin,Eat his ass
Bitmin,and it ends up being the difference between 193rd and 129th
Bitmin,"I'm not sure who to complain about this to or if it's even a) something anyone will care enough to do something about, or b) provable"
Bitmin,Biiiiig leff
Bitmin,
Bitmin,He was playing so clean
Bitmin,Also hbox was missing tons of edgeguards
Bitmin,Hbox missed so much stuff
Bitmin,But still
Bitmin,Also RIP moky
Bitmin,He went ham game one and then just got wizzy'd
Bitmin,Top 8 is much better then expected
Bitmin,I think he did fine
Bitmin,Melee is saved
Bitmin,When's the last time we had hbox out at 5th?
Bitmin,I think it was the summit m2k won perhaps
Bitmin,Also damn look at who's left - mango leffen wizzy axe sfat
Bitmin,That is super good
Bitmin,This gonna be good
Bitmin,I notice a distinct error in this bracket
Bitmin,

Bitmin,Imagine how awesome melee would be in Hbox just quit
Bitmin,or switched characters
Bitmin,Man you didn't used to hate hbox this much

Bitmin,"Marss (ZSS) vs Nairo (ZSS, Wolf, Robin)"
Bitmin,HOLD THE FUCK UP
Bitmin,HE WENT DARK PIT
Bitmin,RANDOM SMASHER
Bitmin,how does he look so serious
Bitmin,MARSS IS LOSING STILL??
Bitmin,my best guess is he's feeling like mars figures out his characters later in the game but he's winning cause he gets an early lead so he's just swapping every game?
Bitmin,but like wtf nairo
Bitmin,you go down 0-2
Bitmin,fucking
Bitmin,500 iq
Bitmin,"switch to wolf, win"
Bitmin,"switch to robin, win"
Bitmin,switch to dark pit for game 5
Bitmin,NO WAY
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,what was that
Bitmin,aight marss figured it out at the end
Bitmin,but honestly whaaaaat
Bitmin,Pit is so bad
Bitmin,alright marss is my favorite player but.......
Bitmin,he still almost got it tho
Bitmin,NAIRO IS INSANE
Bitmin,like that was still really close
Bitmin,this tourney is mega hype
Bitmin,salem beating dabuz with shulk
Bitmin,real question tho
Bitmin,like

Bitmin,marss is very up vs nairo's palu
Bitmin,tweek vs mkleo winners finals
Bitmin,hot damn this man's joker is nuts
Bitmin,mkleo is crazy
Bitmin,I'm loving the fast fall upair regrab shenanagins
Bitmin,well i guess this tourney isn't hype anymore
Bitmin,mkleo's pretty nuts I dunno
Bitmin,mkleo just gonna stomp peeps
Bitmin,tension = 0
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,unless somehow marss gets into grands
Bitmin,but it's still hella nice
Bitmin,i dont think anyone else can beat leo
Bitmin,samsora always loses to leo and tweek just got bodied

Bitmin,except leo i guess
Bitmin,they're actually both playing super well
Bitmin,this is a great set
Bitmin,I'm better at down throw follow ups then mars lol
Bitmin,He missed some easy ones
Bitmin,"roy might be a wacky weight for it, I'm not sure"
Bitmin,he's a weird weight for a lot of things
Bitmin,tweek is getting demolished
Bitmin,That was brutal

Bitmin,I assumed so
Bitmin,What a cool that man is

Bitmin,Bruh
Bitmin,:-(
Bitmin,Wait if that was the whole conversation then he totally in the wrong
Bitmin,If he's seen the trailer he knows what happens to Tony
Bitmin,I can't believe that film came out two months ago

Bitmin,Pretty sure this is an error

Bitmin,????
Bitmin,THAT IS STRANG
Bitmin,I am seeing that too
Bitmin,
Bitmin,@Zain
Bitmin,What is causing this
Bitmin,is it the '
Bitmin,it happened on the bottom too
Bitmin,that is so weird
Bitmin,Its wherever I use apostrophe or quotes
Bitmin,Hmm
Bitmin,Let me bugfix
Bitmin,I've seen this before on my poorly designed home school website. I'm not sure how to fix it but I'm pretty sure that its replacing non-letter characters like ' with stuff.
Bitmin,Looks like I have to use the unicode character for apostrophe's and quotes
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Is that my problem?
Bitmin,it shouldn't be a problem but it depends how you've put together the non-html parts of the website maybe
Bitmin,it can't hurt to unicode it
Bitmin,I have no backend
Bitmin,Its all shiny sauce
Bitmin,is your front end just raw html & css?
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,weird
Bitmin,Bootstrap for the navbar and footer
Bitmin,Font awesome
Bitmin,Simple stuff
Bitmin,"something weird is going on with the formatting, I'm looking at it in chrome dev tools and there's a lot of weirdness"
Bitmin,No don't roast my code
Bitmin,does this happen locally?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,no like the way chrome is interpreting it is weird
Bitmin,What am I looking for?
Bitmin,"just, if you test this code not in the site does it have the same problem?"
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,Well
Bitmin,I don't know now
Bitmin,Because I unicoded everything
Bitmin,it might be something weird with whoever's hosting it
Bitmin,Dreamhost
Bitmin,They are freaky
Bitmin,but also I don't know why you have quotes in your <p> tags
Bitmin,it shouldn't be necessary
Bitmin,uhh
Bitmin,I dont
Bitmin,That is weird
Bitmin,Wait
Bitmin,"<p """">"
Bitmin,"or <p>

STUFF
""""

</p>"
Bitmin,the second
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,"<p>
""
stuff
""
</p>"
Bitmin,"should just be
<p>stuff</p>"
Bitmin,I wrote all the P tag content in a word document and probably put unecessary quotes
Bitmin,Any other tips for formatting stuff?
Bitmin,I can't tell for sure cause what I'm seeing isn't your actual code
Bitmin,just how chrome is parsing it
Bitmin,Problem has been resolved
Bitmin,Thanks unicode
Bitmin,it's still weird that it was happening in the first place
Bitmin,Yeah I looked in my code
Bitmin,I didn't put quotes inside my p tags
Bitmin,Chrome is weird

Bitmin,what did he do
Bitmin,"We start with picking up me then we cross the border to get kameron then we cross the border to pick up schlef then we cross the border to get jed and andrew then we cross the border to get chris then we cross the border to get smithy and karina then we cross the border to get zack then we cross the border to get max and ava then we cross the border to fight fusion then we cross the border to go to LAX to all fly home, we're leaving hte car there"
Bitmin,That is the worst route lol
Bitmin,it is optimal for border crossing
Bitmin,What do you mean?
Bitmin,Why are we doing this
Bitmin,Can you come up with a better one?
Bitmin,Also come get me
Bitmin,Me and chris are basically next to each other
Bitmin,because zain is a raidboss so we need to get the entire party together to combine our strength
Bitmin,maybe they want a long road trip for fun uwu
Bitmin,okay because zack complained i have cleaned up the route
Bitmin,Yes that's much more sane
Bitmin,okay but why in the first place
Bitmin,why are we fighting zain
Bitmin,i need to throw hands with zain
Bitmin,he knows what he's done
Bitmin,and i need my team to back me up
Bitmin,
Bitmin,It's only like 3.5 days of continuous driving
Bitmin,So practically about a week
Bitmin,i prefer the 2 weeks of continuous route
Bitmin,oh then we gotta get back
Bitmin,so double it
Bitmin,What happened to ditching the car at LAX?
Bitmin,witht he optimal route we dont do that
Bitmin,Ah
Bitmin,So it's time & distance efficient but not cost because we lose the cost of the car
Bitmin,Probably a van actually
Bitmin,We are taking Mike's 5 seater
Bitmin,Its gotta fit like ten of us tho
Bitmin,we will strap yall to the top
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Are we doing this?
Bitmin,I am so down
Bitmin,I'll help pay for gas 
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Guys can we please do this
Bitmin,even distribution its about $500 a person
Bitmin,Uhh
Bitmin,uh
Bitmin,
Bitmin,4200 miles / 300 miles per tank = 14 fillups
Bitmin,we but we renting an rv
Bitmin,to fit everyone
Bitmin,14 fill ups x 12 gallons  per gillup = 196 gallons
Bitmin,4 dollars per gallon x 196 gallons = $784
Bitmin,/ 7people = $74 per person
Bitmin,How much is an RV rental?
Bitmin,yeah but we renting an rv so at 100 a night figure 3 weeks thats 2100 plus its not as fuel efficient as your estimate
Bitmin,all these numbers are calculated with the route where we ping pong across hte country and go over hte border 9 times btw
Bitmin,Lol No!!!
Bitmin,XD
Bitmin,Don't use that route
Bitmin,Take the optimal one
Bitmin,nah
Bitmin,What's even the point if we don't use the non-optimal route
Bitmin,I CANNOT AFFORD THE SUB OPTIMAL ROUTE
Bitmin,sub optimal route or we walk

Bitmin,@Meetup Created a role for @ing meetup related people. I gave this role to everyone who will possibly be there. The official days for the meetup were decided yesterday as July 19th (Friday) to July 29th (Monday). The airport Chris's dad would like people to fly in to is Toronto Pearson (YYZ). If anyone has a problem with these days please let us know soon so we can possibly make slight adjustments before I buy my plane tickets.
Bitmin,is it okay if i fly into Hamilton Regional (HAM)?
Bitmin,You literally live there dude
Bitmin,You can but you would have to walk over
Bitmin,F

Bitmin,Fighting Game Controller Tier List
Bitmin,I almost agree with this
Bitmin,"But I would at least put the power glove up to A, maybe even S"
Bitmin,maybe swap the power glove and the vive?
Bitmin,Due to how easy it is to control
Bitmin,N a h
Bitmin,just
Bitmin,bump the glove to A tier
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,Like top of A
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Ok looks good now
Bitmin,I would reverse this and move the wii remote and it would be perfect
Bitmin,you really think fighting your opponent IRL should be 2nd bottom tier?
Bitmin,tbh I had no idea what that picture meant
Bitmin,it means clocking your opoonent in the jaw so you are the only remaining fighter
Bitmin,honestly that strat is pretty foolproof
Bitmin,and its a controller cause you control who actually is able to play
Bitmin,s tier free
Bitmin,Yeah but the one drawback it has is that it only works during lan
Bitmin,Because of that I think it deserves the A spot
Bitmin,Mmmmm you could just swat them
Bitmin,Would that count as it's own thing though?
Bitmin,Or an extension of fighting them
Bitmin,I would
Bitmin,i would
Bitmin,"@Meetup Tickets purchased! People Currently confirmed: Max, Chris, Zack, Benson, Devon. Pending: Andrew, Kameron, Jed. Definite NO: Zain, Smithy, Ava. Toronto Frostbite meetup 2019 is looking to be very good."

Bitmin,
Bitmin,How are you going to play Blackjack in the pool though
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,already got it covered
Bitmin,Fuck
Bitmin, flight would only be $500
Bitmin,And passport is like 100 I think
Bitmin,@Max what other things would I need to account for costwise
Bitmin,uhhhh
Bitmin,It'll probably depend on if I can take a week off work
Bitmin,We are staying at Chris's house
Bitmin,Food/activities?
Bitmin,I'm not really sure how much of that we need to buy
Bitmin,Chris should tell us how much his planned activities cost
Bitmin,@Jed Want the meetup role for regular updates and access to the meetup planning channel?
Bitmin,Yee
Bitmin,I'ma try and make this work
Bitmin,Work will be my only problem I think
Bitmin,I'll go and revise my earlier message
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane if I end up going to the Meetup and you don't I'll fly to Maryland and tell you that I'm disappointed in you
Bitmin,Oh shit
Bitmin,Jed coming now too hopefully
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I have the money it's all about my work
Bitmin,Try to book it off right now
Bitmin,Cause I just started last week and I'm already taking a week vacation this week
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,You can do it
Bitmin,I believe
Bitmin,Sending positive vibes in your direction
Bitmin,I'm not a super essential part of the farm yet like I'm just an extra pair of hands
Bitmin,So hopefully 
Bitmin,farm?
Bitmin,And honestly this Meetup is probably more important to me than this job
Bitmin,Yeah I work on a farm now
Bitmin,what kind of farm
Bitmin,like whats growing
Bitmin,the devil's lettuce
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Yeah we grow hemp
Bitmin,But it's also a dairy and other crops
Bitmin,oh shit dawg
Bitmin,Literally every farm in Oregon is growing hemp cause it's the only place you can
Bitmin,Also there's a chance I'll be able to get a day or two off during the meetup bit I'll have to ask pretty far in advance so if we could figure out which days would be best ahead of time thatd be good
Bitmin,The meetup has been decided as July 19th to 29th
Bitmin,@Max cs?
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Sure be there soon
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak We should probably be able to work around whichever days are easiest for you

Bitmin,The amount of time required to be good enough at a game to have fulfilling speedruns of it is time I would rather spend doing other things.
Bitmin,i dunno about that tho
Bitmin,i feel like once you pin down the necessary tech runs should be pretty fulfilling
Bitmin,I ain't staying up late anymore either

Bitmin,you could also just go without
Bitmin,it'll take a little longer but iirc they just ask you questions
Bitmin,also if you were tryna fly to toronto i thought you needed ur passport anyways

Bitmin,"For those who didn't know, Ally (28) has been exposed for being in a gay relationship with Captain Zack (a MINOR) and has now retired from smash. Let him never return and hopefully go to jail."
Bitmin,"Uuuh you're missing some important parts, cause I'm pretty sure it was technically legal age-wise (just extremely, extremely sketchy), the real issues from what Ive heard of the situation involved physical and sexual assault"
Bitmin,"So yes, hopefully he ends up in jail"
Bitmin,But hey at least this isn't like the Nightmare situation where it was technically legal and he had tons of people on his side
Bitmin,But he'd basically forced a 16 year old to date and sleep his 24-year-old self
Bitmin,At least people are pretty universally against ally
Bitmin,(Also tbh it's weird to me that you focused on the gay part rather than most of the actual problems)
Bitmin,(Most people already knew that they're both gay)
Bitmin,"Aight I looked into it a bit more and apparently the assault stuff was exaggerations and theorizing, so that's less bad at least"
Bitmin,Still creepy borderline pedophilia and I'm glad its come out and that ally is retiring
Bitmin,But he's not gonna end up in jail cause it was technically legal
Bitmin,Max doesnt care if it was legal
Bitmin,pride month is over
Bitmin,     
Bitmin,that makes me sad. ally was such a good player
Bitmin,"I wouldn't say I focused on the gay part at all, I just mentioned it for those who might be unaware. I literally capitalized the word minor to avoid this problem and show the area I was emphasizing. But I guess people would read it that way anyway because its me. Just to clarify, no, I do not think gay people should go to jail. I was referring to the fact that he was dating an underaged person."
Bitmin,yeha i agree with max there it didnt really seem like he focused on it more like an offhand comment
Bitmin,"I mean a) you started with gay, which is usually an emphasis thing, and b) it has no bearing on it being problematic and the phrasing makes it sound like you're giving it roughly even billing with everything else. I get that it wasnt intentional but also given your general opinions it doesn't necessarily come across as such."
Bitmin,"Well, sorry if you took it the wrong way. Maybe I should have left out that detail entirely given my history."
Bitmin,Also there's a bit of an issue with people who do equate homosexuality and pedophilia so its definitely somewhere to watch your phrasing for potential misinterpretation
Bitmin,"I definitely see a difference considering one is consensual and I only object for religious reasons, which you may not agree with but I hope you at least understand. While the other is taking advantage of a difference in intelligence and being a predator."
Bitmin,"Was basically making sure there wasnt a misunderstanding, and also at the time I thought there had also been assault which I thought was more important to mention"
Bitmin,gamers rise up and join vc im lonely
Bitmin,In short: poor communication kills and we both didn't do a great job

Bitmin,Mob Psycho 100 season 1 finished. Totally not for me but I get why its popular. 6/10
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane many people today believe in some pretty crazy ass shit he does debate these crazy people. If he or other people like him waren’t to do this they could and would push there agenda and make more “crazy” people and so thats why its good that he can will and has debated these crazy people. On the topic of likeabilty this is entirly subjective so if you don’t like hin alright cool i guess.
Bitmin,wow dude i didn't realize that destiny was so heroic
Bitmin,truly the savior of our generation
Bitmin,"hi man i'm just addressing the points you brought up. i wake up and i see my lord and savior destiny chan being insulted can't believe this, but in all seriousness he's not a nice person to any extent but the reasoning you brought up for not likeing him is pretty week"

Bitmin,Oh you meant like that
Bitmin,I thought you meant more generally
Bitmin,wouldn't that make the bible the bible part 2
Bitmin,and the book of mormon the bible part 3

Bitmin,NEURALINK UPDATE [OFFICIAL]
Bitmin,"This is not a Path To Neuralink episode. This is my take on an official announcement from Neuralink. At around 6:50pm 7/10/2019, Neuralink announced via Twit..."
Bitmin,Alright question time
Bitmin,Is it rude to make a phone call on a bus
Bitmin,Not is it allowable but is it impolite
Bitmin,It depends on how loud you are being
Bitmin,Like if you are asking everyone on the bus to quiet down so you can hear
Bitmin,That's rude as hell
Bitmin,But if you've got earbuds in or something
Bitmin,You good
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,How do earbuds change anything
Bitmin,I don't know how to explain that any other way
Bitmin,Also obviously emergencies are exempt
Bitmin,I think talking on the phone on a bus is obviously rude
Bitmin,People just don't understand the concept of public spaces
Bitmin,What's the difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you?
Bitmin,I don't think that talking to someone next to you on the bus is polite either
Bitmin,But...
Bitmin,I mean
Bitmin,Just don't be loud
Bitmin,One could argue that talking on the phone is more avoidable
Bitmin,I mean for you to be heard in a bus or metro you gotta talk kinda loud
Bitmin,This is why earbuds are effective
Bitmin,You should be able to hear them without problem
Bitmin,And you don't have to talk as loud if you speak directly into the microphone of the earbuds
Bitmin,"I feel like if you try to keep the conversation to a minimum we good, but if you're voluntarily entering a conversation that's pretty rude"
Bitmin,It's a matter of respecting public space
Bitmin,I guess
Bitmin,Ok both of you are wrong how is talking to the person next to you rude and how is talking on your phone rude and obviously I'm talking about at a respectable volume
Bitmin,if you think talking on the bus is rude ur a bitchass
Bitmin,Dude that's literally my argument at the beginning
Bitmin,Just keep it at a respectable volume
Bitmin,if someone on a bus talks so loud to the point of a problem someone will tell them to shut up
Bitmin,Bro if you guys don't understand the significance of the discussion you're so obviously part of the problem
Bitmin,My argument is that people fail to respect public spaces
Bitmin,our argument is that the discussion has no significance
Bitmin,Yes if you just circumvent the entirety of my argument obviously I appear to be wrong
Bitmin,if youre bothered by people talking in a public space then you have the problem not the speaker
Bitmin,public spacws arent inheritly silent
Bitmin,Respect public spaces people can still talk to each other and respect the people around them
Bitmin,I agree with boi Greg
Bitmin,yes zain that's true but again that's not really my point
Bitmin,also greg
Bitmin,'s argument is actually braindead
Bitmin,YOU CAN'T CHOOSE TO BE IN A PUBLIC SPACE OR NOT ITS NOT YOUR FAULT IF ITS UNCOMFORTABLE
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,that actually makes zero sense to me
Bitmin,BRO IF YOU DONT LIKE  RACISM JUST MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE
Bitmin,4HEAD
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I gotta say this is a mess
Bitmin,thats not a good comparison tho
Bitmin,racism is a real issue people talking on a bus is a mild annoyance at best
Bitmin,I don't see how talking in a public space is a problem
Bitmin,i mean the conversation was fine until these two bozos just lack the understanding of what's being discussed entirely
Bitmin,ok does people talking in class bother you
Bitmin,what about a library
Bitmin,not really
Bitmin,If I'm riding the bus with a friend are we both supposed to just sit there in silence?
Bitmin,Kameron
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,also just because it may not bother you it can bother others
Bitmin,Wait stop those are completely different spaces
Bitmin,That's what I said
Bitmin,Those are terrible examples
Bitmin,that too
Bitmin,Both with existing expectations of quietness
Bitmin,A bus is not a silent space
Bitmin,Those comparison are so bad'
Bitmin,ok but there aren't many other public spaces
Bitmin,the park
Bitmin,Cause in a class you're supposed to listen to a teacher
Bitmin,the street
Bitmin,"its not a matter of does it bother me, its about respecting the wishes of others"
Bitmin,And all libraries have rules against it
Bitmin,In a public space that has no predetermined rules of being quiet
Bitmin,But how do you know it bothers them
Bitmin,u can talk as you like
Bitmin,the street does not fit into the way we are using 'public space' here
Bitmin,This clearly something you think
Bitmin,BUSES ALSO HAVE RULES AGAINST TALKING ON THE BUS YOU MORONS
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,they literally do
Bitmin,Not the buses I'm on
Bitmin,Likewise
Bitmin,if you really are causing serious trouble for someone then they have to notify you to stop or just deal w it
Bitmin,Also ive never heard of a bus with talking eules
Bitmin,its not a matter of serious trouble its a matter of respect
Bitmin,Kameron I want your source
Bitmin,What the fuck kind of buses do they have where you live???
Bitmin,its not a rule as in if you break it you're removed
Bitmin,Respect towards who
Bitmin,i can confirm busses here have no such rules
Bitmin,but a lot of busses have signs that say to keep noise to a minimum
Bitmin,bro where
Bitmin,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/bus-commuters-hold-all-calls-or-else/
Bitmin,"Bus Commuters Hold All Calls, or Else"
Bitmin,"On some New Jersey commuter buses, cellphone use is banned. But some passengers defy the rules and make business and personal calls, which leads to confrontations with drivers and other riders who demand quiet."
Bitmin,"Yeah there's a difference between a conversation and what they're talking about, which is stuff like yelling or blasting music"
Bitmin,Ok that's wack
Bitmin,Thats siper weird lmao
Bitmin,2008
Bitmin,why new jersey gonna have some rule like that when like
Bitmin,And I've never seen anything like that anywhere I've been
Bitmin,proper cities with populated transport dont
Bitmin,That's interesting by that I mean retarded
Bitmin,There's literally no difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you
Bitmin,Again
Bitmin,Just keep it respectable
Bitmin,yes chris I agree
Bitmin,Also this article is from 2008
Bitmin,ok ill admit its the first thing i found
Bitmin,but you guys were like: 'this doesn't exist'
Bitmin,it definitely exists
Bitmin,but you probably have not looked for it
Bitmin,well everything probably exists but a exception does not make the rule
Bitmin,this is the same argument as sniffling during a test
Bitmin,it simply demostrates a lack of understanding that your actions may impact others around you
Bitmin,Sniffling is uncontrollable tho its totally not
Bitmin,false
Bitmin,you can
Bitmin,Wait what
Bitmin,bring a tissue
Bitmin,wipe your nose on your shirt
Bitmin,Sniffing is deffinitly controllable
Bitmin,Just wipe your nose
Bitmin,ask to go to the bathroom
Bitmin,if a tissue isnt provided or if you forget then what
Bitmin,wipe your nose on your shirt
Bitmin,thats actually nasty
Bitmin,imagine getting upset at people sniffling
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Mike
Bitmin,"Shut up, whore"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,so mad
Bitmin,realize that you are sick and then should bring a tissue for your test
Bitmin,Just dont be sick
Bitmin,
Bitmin,plus a test still has an expectation of quiet so sniffling is still.more severe than talking on a bus
Bitmin,its not a matter of severity my guy
Bitmin,A bus has no expectation of quiet
Bitmin,ok that's just raw false
Bitmin,so there is no reason to assume people want quiet
Bitmin,if someone wants quiet then its their job to ask for it
Bitmin,if someone played their music on the bus without earbuds would people be annoyed
Bitmin,NO ITS NOT
Bitmin,in a library its different
Bitmin,you shouldn't have to ask others to be respectful
Bitmin,if someone plays music such that its annoying then just tell them to stop
Bitmin,yes but that doesn't mean its rude in the first place
Bitmin,Its not disrespectful to not assume people want quiet
Bitmin,*not rude
Bitmin,Greg is totally wrong here
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,You just shouldn't blast music out of your phone on the bus
Bitmin,well no you shouldnt
Bitmin,Nobody wants to hear that shit except for you
Bitmin,because loud music is always annoying
Bitmin,It is though
Bitmin,"but talking on a bus isnt usually annoying, especially at a reasonable volume"
Bitmin,yes we all agree
Bitmin,If it doesnt cause problems in general then why is it suddenly disrepectful
Bitmin,that makes 0 sense
Bitmin,because using the condition reasonable volume inherently means that what you are doing isn't disrespectful
Bitmin,"again, your example is unrelated to the argument"
Bitmin,If you want silence in a place that does not demand silence then its not everone elses job to know you want solence
Bitmin,??????
Bitmin,Ur arguement is also totally related
Bitmin,im actually done discussing this with someone who clearly doesn't even understand the issue
Bitmin,breakfast time
Bitmin,You cant just say theres an issue and assume i will accept that
Bitmin,you have to establish the problem first
Bitmin,he said no and left
Bitmin,bruh i told you its breakfast time
Bitmin,i already said why its a problem
Bitmin,I dont assume everyone is going to be quiet unless its a place like a library
Bitmin,I dont think its rude for people to play music in public
Bitmin,Kameron your argument is actually retarded. People pointed out a valid flaw and you moved the fucking goal post

Bitmin,Certified gamer moment
Bitmin,@Trapezoider i see what you mean and ur probably right i think how i phrased the initial question was not what we ended up discussing tbh
Bitmin,but yeah my initial take was overly spice
Bitmin,im gay
Bitmin,yikes
Bitmin,thats pretty gay
Bitmin,also chris apparently investigations have a better chance of the odogaron gen

Bitmin,Attack on Titan Season 3 is actually amazing and one of the best shows I've ever seen
Bitmin,Highly recommend
Bitmin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UH_ys1jnDg
Bitmin,Money joon
Bitmin,@Max agreed I finished it like two weeks ago
Bitmin,h e c k  y e s
Bitmin,1000000/10
Bitmin,Rise up gamers
Bitmin,Shows fucking excellent
Bitmin,Can't wait for season 4
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Its labeled as the final season if you were not aware
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,Not facts
Bitmin,I looked into this
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Straight from myanimelist
Bitmin,https://www.google.com/amp/s/screenrant.com/attack-titan-season-3-game-thrones-mistakes/amp/
Bitmin,Attack On Titan Is Making The Same Mistake As Game Of Thrones
Bitmin,"Game of Thrones rushed its ending, now Attack on Titan is doing the same."
Bitmin,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1148984/Attack-on-titan-season-4-release-date-cast-trailer-plot-when-is-attack-on-titan-out/amp&ved=2ahUKEwjN6YPQhK7jAhVGIDQIHUifCbEQFjALegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw0J1Soh4WbfKnbZkWHLrajo&ampcf=1

Bitmin,You are wrong
Bitmin,There's still like 50 chapters of manga
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I don't think that matters
Bitmin,This season could be long
Bitmin,also manga chapters are short
Bitmin,MAL only posts verifiable information
Bitmin,like most manga I've read where I've also seen the show it's usually like 2-5 chapters per episode
Bitmin,(5 is usually for fights where the action that takes up a lot of panels takes not a lot of screen time)
Bitmin,Wow so that wouldn't even be a full 12 episodes at 5 per episode
Bitmin,(it's usually closer to 2-3)
Bitmin,@Ultimate ultimate?
Bitmin,Max season 3 part 2 is over
Bitmin,I know that
Bitmin,The show has another season coming
Bitmin,Next summer
Bitmin,Yes that is what I was saying
Bitmin,Omg
Bitmin,4head
Bitmin,Also its October
Bitmin,WHAT
Bitmin,no tis july
Bitmin,its october
Bitmin,YO THATS WAY SOO ER
Bitmin,@Feral Nebula FACTZ?
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,NEXT October
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,at least for now
Bitmin,2020
Bitmin,because AOT has a track record of changing plans
Bitmin,so don't count on it one hundo percent
Bitmin,They may want to time the manga and anime to end at the same time to maximize sales
Bitmin,@Max @Sak von Sak ultimate?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Not feeling ultimate right now

Bitmin,Recently
Bitmin,"Just finished some ultimate online.

Gimp him twice (tbag both times because ganon is annoying)
Opponent DC's
Gain no GSP

Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Did you know Mii Brawler can use that command grab dive slam thing to stock trade?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,I've done it

Bitmin,@Max @Sak von Sak wanna watch together?
Bitmin,I made the comeback though so its fine
Bitmin,last few minutes of D&D then sure
Bitmin,I'll join after getting some food
Bitmin,I also discovered a really cool pika edgeguard where you drag down with fair and then footstool. I have no idea if I could repeat it consistently but it was so cool. Gimped a mario at like 60%.
Bitmin,lol fiction's DI is so bad
Bitmin,melee looks so much worse without slippy
Bitmin,
Bitmin,He is using all the wrong moves
Bitmin,"Max, you didn't deserve that GSP anyways, Pika is annoying
~ Benson probably"
Bitmin,Pikachu is so much fun
Bitmin,i dont hate max that much
Bitmin,to say shit like that
Bitmin,I like Pikachu too
Bitmin,tweek game 5 vs a brawlhalla player monkaW
Bitmin,Who?
Bitmin,sandstorm
Bitmin,Wrenched
Bitmin,Oh
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Who does the brawlhalla guy play?
Bitmin,he's playing ken
Bitmin,ken is busted
Bitmin,Ken seems pretty good
Bitmin,I've always been a Ken believer
Bitmin,Ken got buffed
Bitmin,He used to be terrible
Bitmin,I stand by what I said
Bitmin,Imagine wearings knee wraps when squatting less than 135
Bitmin,I don't even know what analogy to give to explain how stupid this guy is
Bitmin,It's like spending $1000 on a custom GameCube controller for your first tournament
Bitmin,Smh
Bitmin,Maybe he has weak knees
Bitmin,Nonono
Bitmin,Not those type of knee straps
Bitmin,I'm talking knee wraps that apply so much force on the lower half of the squat that your legs can do nothing BUT GO UP
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Meant for guys to squat 800 lbs
Bitmin,Very bad for the knees
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Maybe he's just weak as fuck
Bitmin,And needs those to lift
Bitmin,4head
Bitmin,That's not how dis work
Bitmin,@Master Memers TF2
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,:D

Bitmin,because twitter sucka da large pp
Bitmin,Nestle’s children companies
Bitmin,@Master Memers TEAM FORT LATER
Bitmin,Yes Sir
Bitmin,Wizzy just won the smash 64 major
Bitmin,Zain 4 stocked Hbox
Bitmin,zain 4-stocked hbox
Bitmin,woah
Bitmin,
Bitmin,If you watch Leffen's restream he is pointing out all the stuff Hbox is messing up. Its actually really funny how much stuff he gets wrong but doesn't get punished for because he is puff.
Bitmin,hbox bad
Bitmin,leff man real good
Bitmin,Hbox's DI is actually so bad
Bitmin,'dreamland isn't a free win for puff' is such a pepega opinion
Bitmin,alright puff is the best character in the game im down
Bitmin,especially in b05
Bitmin,Welcome to the club
Bitmin,marth #2
Bitmin,b05 actually favors puff and marth so hard
Bitmin,Having a free win is nice
Bitmin,It sure would be good if we had a ban... 
Bitmin,it actually makes viewing melee so much less fun
Bitmin,Ultimate is over an hour late lol
Bitmin,Puff is so interesting
Bitmin,I'd never thought id see the day where i was waiting for another smash game bored outta my mind watching melee
Bitmin,The ruleset needs to be updated to reflect the new meta
Bitmin,Make Melee Great Again
Bitmin,"Ban wobbling, ledge grab limit, bans in bo5"
Bitmin,100%
Bitmin,At least ultimate nerfed Olimar
Bitmin,Olimar being not as good makes the game so much better to watch
Bitmin,ultimate meta is kinda neat
Bitmin,the problem is that the boring matches in melee are also alot longer than the hype ones are
Bitmin,Banning puff would make the game more interesting
Bitmin,so like 3 boring matches in a top 8 takes up half the time
Bitmin,... or more
Bitmin,unfrozen stadium 
Bitmin,Why are they good for bo5?
Bitmin,"anyone: lands 1-2 hits
toph: THATS BIG DAMAGE"
Bitmin,Bo5 has no stage ban. Puff and Marth each have a stage they are massively favored on vs most characters.
Bitmin,I dont like toph
Bitmin,hbox di lol
Bitmin,Pepelaugh
Bitmin,sad
Bitmin,pillowpet guy pog

Bitmin,twitch chat can probably claim to be a proper dialect at this point

Bitmin,alright scratch that it's 3 commentators the 3 not good ones

Bitmin,that looks like a clear downgrade of my paint art
Bitmin,How the fuck
Bitmin,THAT WAS 1 MINUTE
Bitmin,"Thanks I've been bad the whole day wiping my nose, gruggling salt water and drinking non deleted water my throat feels like the Sahara desert my dudes"
Bitmin,I know something that will moisten it up

Bitmin,maybe I'll try again later
Bitmin,I still need that photo of the bathroom and the video from Benson
Bitmin,"but probably no more memes tomorrow. Don't expect too much, it really does take a lot of time. (also I might be busy all day the 24th and 25th)"
Bitmin,okay well this one is done. I'm rendering it rn. I didn't do either of Benson's requests both because the first one took too much editing and the second one bc I never received the clip for it.
Bitmin,Just to make a statement if you guys really need me to I can continue editing the clips together if for whatever reason none of you can but the fancy editing and memes will be minimal from here on out because this is taking upwards of two and a half hours everyday and it's really draining. glad you guys enjoyed the memes while they lasted though.
Bitmin,i enjoyed it for the first two days but its just too much im sorry

Bitmin,yeah but i thought that hero only costs 6 dollars
Bitmin,so it'd be cheaper to buy 4 characters
Bitmin,and then not buy banjo cause he looks dumb
Bitmin,
Bitmin,real talk you'd probably still save money cause most tournaments give you a discount for bringing a setup
Bitmin,and not having all the characters means they can't use your setup
Bitmin,Yeah but Kameron dumb
Bitmin,i dont really want tournies to use my setup cause then i'd have to stay there after going 0-4
Bitmin,
Bitmin,KappaSad
Bitmin,Lmao
Bitmin,Also saving a dollar specifically not to get banjo seems wasteful
Bitmin,you kight as well buy joker onmy
Bitmin,I mean i havent bought joker yet either
Bitmin,also @Rotomotorz are you home now?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,unluck
Bitmin,i leave
Bitmin,in two days
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,then we play mhw
Bitmin,but then the day after i get back i go to new york for a splat lan
Bitmin,We can play tonight tho
Bitmin,"Random idea: Settlers of Catan could be made into a more consistent game by replacing the dice with a deck of cards with the numbers 1-12 on them. The deck would have the same number of each number as that number has dots on the board. For example, there would be one card with ""2"" and one card with ""12"" while there would be five cards with ""8"". The deck would be completely drawn through before reshuffling. This would ensure players get the exact return they should on their investments into certain tiles and would eliminate a lot of randomness from the game."
Bitmin,doesnt that give a totally unfair advantage to the person selecting second
Bitmin,since the second person geenrally had the best choices overall for picks
Bitmin,I don't think this change would give an unfair advantage. There will be games where the person who picks good tiles will get an even bigger advantage if they get lucky with rolls and games where they do very poorly because of bad luck. The first scenario is unfun because that person is highly likely to win and the second is unfun because that person is just losing to luck. My rules change would just balance out the outliers and make the game more dependent on skill.
Bitmin,"Ultimately managing resources based on luck is a type of skill, vs knowing ""oh i have a sheep coming so I dont have to do anything"""
Bitmin,It also makes player trading worthwhile
Bitmin,@The Rona come play with us nerd
Bitmin,I eat
Bitmin,"@Mr. Airplane @The Rona I'm gonna grab something to eat, then pokemon?"
Bitmin,@SWIRL GIRL WOW OK

Bitmin,"just sorta show up whenever, Kameron's finishing an OW game"
Bitmin,"I really dislike the design of the Hero. Random crits, random down B, random move on the down B, instant kill. Whyyyyyyyy"
Bitmin,@The Rona WOAH I HEARD U WAS TALKING SHIT
Bitmin,the hero sounds lit
Bitmin,what are you talking about
Bitmin,random crits?
Bitmin,that's my jam

Bitmin,"Max, you listed the same point twice"
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,ima be back in 10
Bitmin,ima leave in 10
Bitmin,"@The Rona Those are two different reasons. The down B is inherently random by selecting 4 moves. One of the possible moves to get is a move that does something completely random, even potentially harmful to yourself."
Bitmin,I forgot about that one
Bitmin,But also
Bitmin,Just don't pick that one
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Guys I lost my gf and I'm scared

Bitmin,Actually useless
Bitmin,Another patch of my characters not being changed
Bitmin,Works for me
Bitmin,What projectiles even do 50% ???0
Bitmin,Probably items/already reflected projectiles
Bitmin,I'm just greatful that they didn't destroy him
Bitmin,it might just be cause it lasts so long that you can double reflect with a single input?
Bitmin,but that's still... kinda dumb
Bitmin,Tetracon last long but not that long though
Bitmin,mebe
Bitmin,"still, I'm hyped about zard getting buffs to ftilt, fsmash (like it wasn't already hella strong when you hit it??), longer-lasting nair, and a stronger fthrow"
Bitmin,i can confirm that hero is retarded
Bitmin,but super fun
Bitmin,imagine slower robin with killpower
Bitmin,i think hero is mid high tier
Bitmin,once people learn the matchup
Bitmin,joker still best character in game
Bitmin,watching more gameplay of zero kicking ass
Bitmin,i no longer think he's mid high tier

Bitmin,you are underestimating accelerate
Bitmin,but good tier list
Bitmin,9/10 would agree
Bitmin,i also think snooze is A
Bitmin,accelerate just too fast
Bitmin,speed is usually good but you simply go too fast for it to be useful
Bitmin,snooze is mega slow
Bitmin,and thus more situational
Bitmin,snooze gives you free kill and you can throw ppl into it
Bitmin,because its slow
Bitmin,"also, if you can control accelerate it scary"
Bitmin,Yeah but Hero's grab sucks ass
Bitmin,"""if you can"""
Bitmin,not sure if its really even feasible
Bitmin,7/10 times i see kameron use snooze it does something stupid
Bitmin,also i can control it
Bitmin,That's because it is almost never the correct option to use it
Bitmin,it's not that hard
Bitmin,And the times where you do use it
Bitmin,It was the correct situation to do so
Bitmin,Conformation bias
Bitmin,"yea, yea, conformation bias with kameron's tierlist too"
Bitmin,i mean in all fairness
Bitmin,the reasoning behind all of the a and s tier spells is that they are consistently very useful in most situations
Bitmin,except for magic burst which is just ridiculous in certain situations

Bitmin,anyone wana watch top 8 with me?
Bitmin,boys boys boys boys
Bitmin,circular television. my new latest idea.
Bitmin,TV's used to be round
Bitmin,
Bitmin,are you saying like miniature imax?
Bitmin,boys boys boys boys
Bitmin,spherical television my grand newest idea
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,terrible idea
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,come watch evo with me
Bitmin,top 8 starting
Bitmin,I don't know if I've ever seen a smash tournament do winner's side top 8 before loser's side
Bitmin,they've been doing it all day
Bitmin,it is a bit weird but it's an evo thing I guess
Bitmin,This is the first I've watched of evo
Bitmin,this year
Bitmin,Last 2 days were lan night + practice for it
Bitmin,i want raito to lose because duck hunt is lame
Bitmin,duck hunt is so interesting
Bitmin,he's not lame
Bitmin,eh I kinda like raito's duck hunt
Bitmin,he's got super neat setups
Bitmin,also this is some hella mediocre commentary
Bitmin,basically nothing but play-by-play
Bitmin,yea this commentary is trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Bitmin,imagine having evo top 8 and not bringing in the full blast zone 
Bitmin,What is the full blast zone?
Bitmin,"ee, tk, coney"
Bitmin,tricast
Bitmin,they have better commentators for the in-arena stuff
Bitmin,tk d1 ee
Bitmin,"not the best there is, but still better than this"
Bitmin,like both cinnpie and coney are good commentators
Bitmin,but they fill very similar roles
Bitmin,eeeeeeeh they're not great
Bitmin,but yeah definitely part of the problem is that they're both doing nothing but play-by-play commentary
Bitmin,"no analysis, nothing about player mentality, etc"
Bitmin,i'm so bored
Bitmin,by this commentary
Bitmin,it's great if you want to do something else and just listen tho lol
Bitmin,not for top 8
Bitmin,it was a joke
Bitmin,that you don't need to watch cause you can just listen
Bitmin,r/woosh
Bitmin,and they'll tell you everything that happens
Bitmin,fuck it im watching evo in japanese
Bitmin,ok japanese commentators are so much more entertaining
Bitmin,especially when you can make out a few words
Bitmin,thank you anime

Bitmin,his baits are so good with zard
Bitmin,how are they more entertaining when you can only understand like 5 words
Bitmin,"1, i can consintrate on the game more
2, the commintatiors react better"
Bitmin,ah
Bitmin,ayy smash 4 combos still works with fox? i thoiught they removed thoes
Bitmin,"some do, some don't"
Bitmin,i thought fair to upair didnt work anymore
Bitmin,no idea
Bitmin,it might be a 50/50 now
Bitmin,also lucina lookin clean
Bitmin,rip light
Bitmin,proto's looking super good tho
Bitmin,zackray leo for 7th monkaW
Bitmin,hope zack gets bodied
Bitmin,gooo mk!
Bitmin,just joker things
Bitmin,I like zackray
Bitmin,but I'm still cheering for mkleo
Bitmin,zack is good
Bitmin,mk makes me want to repick up joker
Bitmin,YO FUCK THIS BITCH SAMSORA
Bitmin,GO PROTO
Bitmin,@Ultimate we should do some fun in house tournies more often
Bitmin,we'll need a house first
Bitmin,but yeah I know what you mean
Bitmin,we should do em like we used to do RoA tourneys
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,those were super fun
Bitmin,speaking of we should also play rivals more
Bitmin,Would we include a nerf mechanic like character banning to encourage less skilled players to attend?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,that's what I meant by like our old RoA stuff
Bitmin,thumb wrestling tourney
Bitmin,
Bitmin,if I can get my adapter working with RoA I'm totally down to keep playing it
Bitmin, Japanese players are gone 
Bitmin,rip
Bitmin,The west is the best
Bitmin,I mean raito's still in
Bitmin,wait no
Bitmin,bruh
Bitmin,I'm dumb
Bitmin,Wait
Bitmin,3head
Bitmin,got confused by the winner's/loser's timeslot swap
Bitmin,lmao
Bitmin,Japan is west of the US
Bitmin,"yes, but it's still called the east"
Bitmin,don't ask
Bitmin,These terms are from Europe
Bitmin,Max likes Japan better than the USA
Bitmin,the east is just extra west 
Bitmin,
Bitmin,The terms are from the perspective of Europe
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,Nope
Bitmin,"Japan west, change my mind"
Bitmin,do you guys wanna all watch together?
Bitmin,thats why im in here
Bitmin,Japan is an honorary western country
Bitmin,no one is joining pepehands
Bitmin,I would rather watch alone
Bitmin,same personally
Bitmin,"I'd be down for stuff after, but also I'll probably just pass out cause it'll be late"
Bitmin,i see how it is q.q
Bitmin,zard's so gross I love it
Bitmin,he was at like 45%
Bitmin,he was at 50
Bitmin,close to 70
Bitmin,so 60
Bitmin,i can math
Bitmin,i'm asian
Bitmin,ayo commentators not knowing how many jumps zard has
Bitmin,this is why im watching the japanese dub
Bitmin,do you know why tweak dropped wario?
Bitmin,He thought wario struggled too much at approaching and thought PT fit his style better
Bitmin,ah
Bitmin,i can see that with wario
Bitmin,I just remembered I got 13th at a brawl major
Bitmin,what a game
Bitmin,Out of how many entrants?
Bitmin,39 lol
Bitmin,and I got a bye cause one of my opponents DQ'd
Bitmin,"still, 13th at a major that was my first brawl tournament, with the second worst character in the game"
Bitmin,also I love how all these 'blast to the past' clips are just a great reminder of how much better of a spectator game ultimate is
Bitmin,Also just a better game
Bitmin,"yeah, but especially from a spectating perspective"
Bitmin,the gap there is bigger than the gameplay gap imo
Bitmin,imagine looking at smash 4 with rose tinted glasses
Bitmin,Smash 4 summarized
Bitmin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJfLLhnvrWE
Bitmin,Super Smash Bros. - Bayonetta Victory Theme (HQ)
Bitmin,The victory theme for Bayonetta in Super Smash Bros 4. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS. IT BELONGS TO NINTENDO.
Bitmin,doesn't rose-tinted imply I'm looking at it as if it was better?
Bitmin,r/woosh
Bitmin,Just counted and apparently I've mained 12 characters throughout my time playing ultimate.
Bitmin,Benson being unclear and then doing r/woosh when I'm confused is not clever
Bitmin,This grands should be cool
Bitmin,i'm rooting for tweak only because he's the underdog
Bitmin,I like Leo's style better so I'm for him
Bitmin,and yes zack it's implying that smash 4 was better
Bitmin,leo's style is closer to mine
Bitmin,so i might pick up joker and learn some stuff
Bitmin,I'm rooting for tweek cause PT
Bitmin,WHAT
Bitmin,"neither has an evo yet, right?"
Bitmin,pt tmight be the best character
Bitmin,"""PT isn't top tier"" ~Zack"
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,I'm reconsidering that position
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,I still think PT isn't the best
Bitmin,but I'm not as sure as I used to be
Bitmin,"top tier is something like peach joker pika lucina PT, no idea about the order"
Bitmin,at least prepatch
Bitmin,we'll have to see how things shake up postpatch
Bitmin,You forget Palu and Snake
Bitmin,i dont think palu is top 5
Bitmin,He said top tier not top 5
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,tweak is so fkin good
Bitmin,YO
Bitmin,*leo
Bitmin,LEO'S NUUUUUTS
Bitmin,What a come back
Bitmin,mk is so fkin good
Bitmin,also joker busted
Bitmin,cabbage dog
Bitmin,reverse 3-0
Bitmin,tweek looked bad that game
Bitmin,I think he's shook from the three stock comeback
Bitmin,shit lookin like me vs zack when i read all his tricks
Bitmin,poor tweak
Bitmin,OHHHHHHHHHHHH
Bitmin,if that hittttttttttttttttt
Bitmin,TWEAK
Bitmin,Tweek not tweak
Bitmin,"he went too deep and basically got hit with the ""well I guess I'm fucked eithe way, might as well"""
Bitmin,benson pls
Bitmin,what max said
Bitmin,I don't think that was intentional
Bitmin,tewwk
Bitmin,It was totally intentional
Bitmin,I mean the sideb was
Bitmin,but I don't think he wanted to be in the position where he had to go for it
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,its over
Bitmin,yea leo has momentum
Bitmin,tweek won two games
Bitmin,then mkleo's on five straight
Bitmin,I saw that
Bitmin,yeah yeah
Bitmin,also I'm gonna crack up if the last game of the biggest smash tournament ever is to the tune of route 209
Bitmin,ill be a miricle if te\wk
Bitmin,fkit
Bitmin,typing is hard
Bitmin,twerk
Bitmin,joker's recovery is stupidly good
Bitmin,the japanese commentators ask what happened to tweak
Bitmin,tweek*
Bitmin,he was doing so well
Bitmin,poor tweek
Bitmin,ggs
Bitmin,hot damn
Bitmin,that was nutty
Bitmin,tweek almost stole it lol
Bitmin,Great grand finals
Bitmin,that was a good grands
Bitmin,wow dude he looks so emotional 
Bitmin,can we talk about that loser's run from mkleo tho
Bitmin,that was like eight or nine sets
Bitmin,wow that was a good guess
Bitmin,"it was literally 8 people, 9 sets if you count grands as two sets"
Bitmin,proto has a new fan
Bitmin,he makes lucina look fub

Bitmin,ayyy
Bitmin,"my aunt just said ""bye Felecia"", and my mom asked why she said that and she said ""i don't know it's just something that people say"""
Bitmin,
Bitmin,k
Bitmin,oh shit what happened in leff vs salem?
Bitmin,some beef went down
Bitmin,it basically went down like this
Bitmin,Game 1 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is behind the whole time but makes a comeback with vine whip) Game 2 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is winning but chokes and loses) Game 3 (PT vs Hero: Leffen wins fairly convincingly)
Bitmin,sasuage man went to go say hello to the big leaf
Bitmin,but then the leaf turned sideways
Bitmin,then sasuage man went all hero mode
Bitmin,but then lost because resarch

Bitmin,vish dj chillin tricast for top 8 sick
Bitmin,zain has the wackest mustache
Bitmin,why did he do this
Bitmin,mdva so strong in melee feelsgoodman
Bitmin,"mdva: melee strong
mdva: facial hair weak"
Bitmin,junebug tho
Bitmin,he got some clean facial hair
Bitmin,fair
Bitmin,This might be the lamest I've ever seen hbox play
Bitmin,he really is killing melee
Bitmin,ban puff
Bitmin,no meme
Bitmin,also zain just looked so defeated after game 2 ended
Bitmin,man poor amsa has to fight falcon right into peach
Bitmin,that said he did 3-0 s2j so we'll see how this goes
Bitmin,there are too many lame characters in melee
Bitmin,matches like yoshi peach and puff marth are too slow for a top eight
Bitmin,yoshi vs floaties is fairly boring
Bitmin,yoshi is boring when amsa is losing and is thus forced to camp
Bitmin,he honestly does the same stuff hbox does but amsa is more likeable so people dont care
Bitmin,also it looks cooler
Bitmin,in all fairness tho llod is the one camping
Bitmin,llod zain losers semis maybe
Bitmin,none is sick
Bitmin,let's go none
Bitmin,my stream froze partway through the zain none set and I got this great screenshot just as none's getting fsmashed off stage
Bitmin,zain looks like he on some shit
Bitmin,guys i fell asleep while watching hbox play
Bitmin,like no meme i actually fell asleep
Bitmin,Melee saved... for now

Bitmin,Ike doesn't have a plus 1 against cloud
Bitmin,I just suck at edge guarding
Bitmin,Plus i have blade beam
Bitmin,That can kill you at zero
Bitmin,On top of that i have a better neutral
Bitmin,Cloud has a plus 1 against ike
Bitmin,I also think ike loses to pit
Bitmin,Eeeeh I dunno about that
Bitmin,Nair oos hits ike
Bitmin,That can lead to fair and boom offstage
Bitmin,Plus arrows
Bitmin,Dead ikr
Bitmin,Nair oos wont hit unless crap spacing by ike
Bitmin,It can also antiair him
Bitmin,Also that combo only works at low percents
Bitmin,Also only preemptively cause he outranges and outspeeds pit
Bitmin,If you can get him off stage its doable but its super hard to win neutral at all
Bitmin,And he gets more off any given neutral win
Bitmin,Ike pit is such a fun mu.
Bitmin,Idk bout dark pit
Bitmin,It's worse cause bad arrows
Bitmin,So he kinda just has no place where he can wreck ike
Bitmin,He just sorta loses all the time instead of just most o the time
Bitmin,Im pretty sure fair beats his quickdraw
Bitmin,Imo pit ike is 55 45 respectfully

Don't worry, they are really easy and quick to make. Each round will be available for an indeterminate amount of time, so make sure you vote whenever you can. I will advance the round whenever it seems like everyone who would vote, has voted already. I have given a new role to everyone who gave suggestions in the submissions channel that I will use to update you guys on the progress of the voting bracket. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, remove the role from yourself. Alternatively, if you want the role and didn't get it, feel free to add it to yourself or ask a master memer to do it for you. Have fun everyone!"

Bitmin,thank god
Bitmin,There is also a losers bracket
Bitmin,get ready for the come back of a century
Bitmin,I don't think anime is well represented enough in the voter base to win this
Bitmin,time to slit my wrists xd
Bitmin,I've honestly got no idea what will win though
Bitmin,I don't think there is a clear favorite
Bitmin,money..?
Bitmin,I can easily see money losing to a meme
Bitmin,valid
Bitmin,I think money has a really good matchup vs anything serious but will probably lose to a meme answer
Bitmin,also
Bitmin,and its gotta be stated
Bitmin,have you tried asian food
Bitmin,shits delicious
Bitmin,yes I have and it is BUT anime is all around a better experience
Bitmin,But have you ever watched anime and eaten anime at the same time?

Bitmin,naw I ended up doing normal+classic
Bitmin,Bro
Bitmin,You didn't even wait for a response
Bitmin,I waited like five minutes
Bitmin,you waited 3
Bitmin,shhh
Bitmin,maybe less
Bitmin,It was 2 minutes since my message
Bitmin,I'm impatient okay
Bitmin,jeez
Bitmin,Normal is too easy
Bitmin,From everyone iv talked to
Bitmin,welp too late now
Bitmin,Just restart
Bitmin,although I'm still on the prologue
Bitmin,so yeah
Bitmin,anyways if you think hard is too hard you can downgrade later
Bitmin,but you can never upgrade
Bitmin,"also side note, if I'm restarting I want to know the name of that weird chick who asks what my name is"
Bitmin,"so that I can give myself the same name and see if she still goes ""all y'all humans got some wack ass names"""
Bitmin,Sothis
Bitmin,I highly doubt you'll get away with it but you can try
Bitmin,also it'll definitely make dialogue weird eventually
Bitmin,I feel like its just gonna be like
Bitmin,"""No"""
Bitmin,but w/e I'll figure stuff out with pronouns cause I'm gonna be a dude
Bitmin,"pfft she still goes ""I shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names"""
Bitmin,come on nintendo
Bitmin,Wait are you actually allowed to do that
Bitmin,What is she if not a human?
Bitmin,wacl
Bitmin,wack*
Bitmin,based on her appearance and a few little details I've picked up Imma assume she's a dragon
Bitmin,also I'm 90% sure she automatically has the same birthday as you
Bitmin,cause she definitely comments on that one
Bitmin,"also, don't tell me, but if she's eventually a playable character and romance option I'm gonna crack up"
Bitmin,just for the theoretical
Bitmin,"""Do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded wife?""
""I do.""
""And do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded husband?""
""I do."""
Bitmin,aight they don't even change sothis' lines if your name is also sothis
Bitmin,"maaaaan it made my weird friendship counter thing with Sothis decrease because I took the ""guess I'll die"" dialogue option"
Bitmin,this has now made me afraid of choosing all the snarky options

Bitmin,or leffen's gonna slaughter him
Bitmin,jesus moky is fast
Bitmin,he's nuts
Bitmin,side note who the hell is Kevin Maples
Bitmin,and why is he in top 8
Bitmin,everything moky does is a clip
Bitmin,that game was so spaghetti
Bitmin,"mostly leffen, but a little moky too"
Bitmin,game five tho
Bitmin,MOOOOKY
Bitmin,YOU'RE NUUUUTS
Bitmin,    
Bitmin,LETS GO
Bitmin,he SD'd super low and still went nuts
Bitmin,that second last stock was unreal
Bitmin,THE MENTAL
Bitmin,leffen's already tweeted lol
Bitmin,that was so fast
Bitmin,all around that might have been the best fox ditto I've seen since armada retired
Bitmin,can leffen ever complement his opponent
Bitmin,that'd be nice
Bitmin,https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439331114397698
Bitmin,Played like shit but still better than I expected with no warmup. Very unlikely I'm playing losers tomorrow. Ggs all
Bitmin,what a child
Bitmin,he's been super salty all day
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Bruh
Bitmin,"also, it's gonna be hbox vs ibdw, and moky vs winner of sfat s2j"
Bitmin,I win my first top 16 match
Bitmin,moky could make grands winner's side if ibdw wins
Bitmin,i think ibdw would win a fox ditto
Bitmin,if sfat beats s2j i could see ibdw winning the whole thing
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,"I wasn't saying moky would be favoured to make winner's side grands, just that it's not improbable"
Bitmin,like 1/3 maybe
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439884292743168
Bitmin,"Don't get me wrong, mokys sick and has been putting in work, he def deserves winners top 8 way more. Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,i mean gave him credit after giving like 8 johns and threatening to dq himself
Bitmin,he's been threatening to DQ himself all day lol
Bitmin,like several days actually
Bitmin,"""Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"" and its an underhanded complement"
Bitmin,I mean they both SD'd a bunch
Bitmin,and I don't think that's so bad honestly
Bitmin,like it's a bit john-y but w/e
Bitmin,and I think it's fair given his SDs game 4
Bitmin,I'd be hella salty
Bitmin,I personally have no issue with the way leffen talks. It seems he uses a variant of the Max mindset.
Bitmin,eh he's been really salty in general at shine
Bitmin,"like zero respect for anyone who beats him, puts all the blame on stuff that... he controls, at least to a degree"
Bitmin,every ult bracket he blames matchups he doesn't know
Bitmin,and like yeah he's trying to learn stuff but at a certain point you just gotta suck it up
Bitmin,"You've just described the Max mindset. In short ""Its always my own fault""."
Bitmin,That is a great mindset for a winner
Bitmin,yeah but I'm saying he's not doing that
Bitmin,"he's blaming it on other stuff, like lack of sleep, or bad scheduling, or not knowing the matchups"
Bitmin,Blaming SD's or playing bad or lack of matchup knowledge are all things that you did wrong
Bitmin,he's putting the responsability on everything but himself and his opponent
Bitmin,bad scheduling is the only thing you listed that is not his own fault
Bitmin,okay but the sleep thing is a huge john
Bitmin,Have you tried flying 6 timezones or so away and then having to play 13 hours in one day with no sleep
Bitmin,yes but he chose that
Bitmin,Seems hard and like a legitimate excuse
Bitmin,it's like blaming that you're playing a low tier
Bitmin,"like yeah, it's a disadvantage"
Bitmin,but you chose the disadvantage
Bitmin,he didn't have to play both games
Bitmin,You can choose to switch mains. You don't choose to be born European.
Bitmin,fly in earlier
Bitmin,only play one game
Bitmin,he was considering it
Bitmin,"and he doesn't get to both decide he's in the position to play both games despite everything else, then when he loses blame those things"
Bitmin,Its better than people dropping our constantly to preserve a reputation. Imagine a world like that.
Bitmin,I'm glad he entered both games
Bitmin,but that's not what I'm arguing about
Bitmin,"I don't think the move to preserve his reputation would have been to only enter one, it would have been to not bitch about things that were at least partially under his control when things don't go his way"
Bitmin,By reputation I mean ranking and future seeding
Bitmin,but that's not what we're talking about
Bitmin,we're talking about his behaviour and mentality
Bitmin,I'm saying I would rather people stay in bracket and john when they lose instead of drop out whenever they think they are not playing their absolute best to preserve their ranking.
Bitmin,"I'm normally on his side for a lot of things, but I think that the sequence of events of:

1) call out flaws with tournament
2) suggest how he could handle them better
3) not follow his own suggestions
4) bitch about the things he didn't avoid

is not a good look"
Bitmin,"once you've reached 3), you're not really in a position to complain about it"
Bitmin,I really don't even understand how his actions could be interpreted as points 2 and 3 but whatever.
Bitmin,"he goes ""I should drop out of melee so that my sleep schedule and all that is intact cause I'm not really feeling it, plus fuck shine for making such a dumb schedule so their tourney should suffer for it."" That's #2. Playing anyway at the cost of his sleep and proper warmup for either game is #3. Blaming the tournament structure and his lack of sleep and warmup for his losses is #4"
Bitmin,"my point isn't that he shouldn't have entered both games, it's that once he's committed to that, knowing full well all the issues it would cause him, I don't think he's entitled to complain about it"
Bitmin,"again, it's like choosing a low tier. Yes, playing a low tier disadvantaged you, but you knew what you were getting yourself into, so suck it up or change characters. Don't blame the game for not making your character good"

Bitmin,he seems right up my alley
Bitmin,I only have one functioning ethernet port in my room
Bitmin,

Bitmin,like lmfao
Bitmin,"First impressions of Banjo: 
I don't like his design. He seems like a character designed for camping and cheese kills. So perfect for Zack I guess."

Bitmin,we've established this
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Also the grenade recovery looks awful
Bitmin,He's super vulnerable
Bitmin,Banjo sucks
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I don't see him being any better than bottom 10 characters
Bitmin,Maybe even bottom 3
Bitmin,It's wack cause everyone on Reddit is like wow his recovery is so good
Bitmin,But it clearly isn't
Bitmin,I tested with Ava yesterday and down throw into side B can be mashed out of well into kill%
Bitmin,Yeah he also sucks at killing

Bitmin,I had the weirdest discussion with my housemates today
Bitmin,we spent like 45 minutes discussing one question
Bitmin,"""Can a person be taller than they are old?"""
Bitmin,any baby
Bitmin,done
Bitmin,it spiralled off into like four hours of weird random stuff and it was a great time
Bitmin,"Chris, explain"
Bitmin,because the deeper you get into the specifics the more insane this conversation can become
Bitmin,babies are 0 years of age
Bitmin,babies are taller than 0 of any measurement for length
Bitmin,Therefore yes
Bitmin,A person can be taller than their age
Bitmin,yeah that was me and one other guy's argument
Bitmin,"but it got into a convoluted discussion of the meaning of age, weird semantics, and we eventually ended up talking about quantum physics"
Bitmin,Interesting
Bitmin,...
Bitmin,...
Bitmin,"basically one guy's point was that age cannot be zero, since its the amount of time that has passed since something came into existence, and if no time has passed, its age just flat out doesn't exist rather than being zero"
Bitmin,"Well okay, even if you are one year old, you are probably taller than one of any significant form of measurement"
Bitmin,Or once it does begin to exist after itnhas been born
Bitmin,yeah but no kind of measurement was specified
Bitmin,It's age will be somewhere between 0 and 1
Bitmin,Therefore my original statement holds true aswell
Bitmin,"also the fact that time and distance aren't really comparable, regardless of unit"
Bitmin,which is how we ended up in quantum physics
Bitmin,I mean I guess but in the context we can assume we are just comparing absolute values
Bitmin,can we though
Bitmin,do you even know the context
Bitmin,the context was wack as hell
Bitmin,
Bitmin,it came from a badly translated article about yao ming's daughter
Bitmin,how we got to that is another story
Bitmin,but also it's late and I should sleep
Bitmin,so gnight all
Bitmin,Goodnight
Bitmin,I was typing periods to test my lag since I wasn't able to send messages
Bitmin,Those periods took several minutes to actually register as sent
Bitmin,alright played a banjo online

Bitmin,imagine needing fingers
Bitmin,smh
Bitmin,"i still got 17th because i won in winners, but i coulda done much better"
Bitmin,"had my first kingston weekly since april 2018 yesterday:
ultimate (https://kingstonsmash.challonge.com/KU33): 38 people, I got 9th, but only because I lost to 4th seed (who won the whole thing), and then immediately got the top seed cause he sandbagged with banjo in winner's. Looking at who I would have had to fight if I he hadn't sandbagged, I would have had three people I've never lost to, so I probably should have gotten 4th. Also Lucas is a super wack matchup that I've never played so I'm glad I beat both the ones I fought.
melee (https://challonge.com/raw0xlb4): smaller tournament because there's a bigger event today, got 4/17, lost to 1st and 2nd, and all close games (0-2 for both, but still mostly last-hit games). Also, my marth is not ready for sheik. Beat a pr'd sheik where he jv3'd my marth and then I double two-stocked him with samus. Got 2 PR wins so I think I'm well on my way to this season's PR.
various traditional fighters that didn't have brackets: I'm nutty at unist even on a controller I'm not used to. Guilty gear is really fun but also really fucking hard, and I'm gonna be really upset if I end up with yet another fighting game where I hate the visual design of my best character."
Bitmin,"now today I've got a bigger melee tournament that should have more of the PR (yesterday only had half the PR), and more people in general, and a proper unist bracket that I think I'll be able to place in the money for, so long as I can stay somewhat consistent with a weird control scheme"
Bitmin,When my life is crumbling apart but it’s my birthday so I gotta play it cool 
Bitmin,
Bitmin,@Ultimate Someone fight me
Bitmin,I can't seem to join voice in here so I'll be in frostbite 1
Bitmin,tfw you dont have frostbyte 1
Bitmin,@Galf
Bitmin,Going to a tournament wish me luck. Also what character should I play @Ultimate ?
Bitmin,Banjo Kazooie @Max
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,Pokemon trainer
Bitmin,Then why ask
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Welp I did terribly in melee
Bitmin,"Between pools and bracket, 1-4"
Bitmin,Mostly respectable losses but I feel like I should have won 3 of them
Bitmin,"On the flip side, second in unist"
Bitmin,Got the reset bracket into get 3-0d classic
Bitmin,well zack
Bitmin,looks like its time to come back and play me in ultimate instead
Bitmin,i lost to two pts so gotta grind 
Bitmin,I'm 1-1 right now. Likely fighting a Samus next
Bitmin,ya boi made five entire dollars from UNIST today
Bitmin,and only spent 14 on the tournament and food
Bitmin,and honestly I'm more happy that I didn't get 3rd than that I got 2nd
Bitmin,because getting 3rd would have involved losing to someone who started playing unist last night
Bitmin,he brought me to game 5 last round
Bitmin,Basically double 3 stocked the Samus. My Palu is looking clean.
Bitmin,Next match is the winner of an inkling ditto. Anyone got any tips for this matchup?
Bitmin,@Max just play bowser 4head
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak wanna jame jamer?
Bitmin,Beat the inkling but lost to the same wolf player I lost to round 1 rip.
Bitmin,Went 3-2
Bitmin,Got 7th
Bitmin,Got seeded terrible since no one knew who I was so I'm satisfied with my performance. Aside from 1 game of ike I went all Palu.
Bitmin,i think
Bitmin,bowser is actually bad vs heavies
Bitmin,10/10 would recommend abandoned 1800s Masonic cemeteries
Bitmin,Bro
Bitmin,Bro
Bitmin,We deadass were leaving and heard laughing around us
Bitmin,We looked it up later and it's common for people to be chased out and get scratches from a witch who was hung and buried there
Bitmin,And we all thought we were good but we got home and one of my friend checked his back and he had a long scratch mark down his back
Bitmin,That cemetery is the #1 most haunted place in oregon
Bitmin,Are you sure he didn't just get scratched on a tree branch or something?
Bitmin,It was 3 scratches going sideways across his lower back
Bitmin,It didn't look like a scratch from a bush
Bitmin,And one of our other friends refused to go because he had gotten a deep scratch the last time he went
Bitmin,MonkaW
Bitmin,We were chilling and my stomach just dropped and I told them we had to get out of there before 12
Bitmin,I had a feeling bad shit would happen if we were in there when it hit 12
Bitmin,It was wack
Bitmin,Just checked yesterdays bracket and I actually got 5th not 7th
Bitmin,nice

Bitmin,I like the rabbit character
Bitmin,Well come play
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I'm home in 1.5 hours
Bitmin,The game is not fun but the art on that particular character's cards is rather amusing
Bitmin,@Max
Bitmin,I'll play poker
Bitmin,Poker?
Bitmin,Ayy
Bitmin,Let's go
Bitmin,Max I read a short book on poker
Bitmin,What @Trapezoider ?
Bitmin,So I don't suck now
Bitmin,I mean I still suck just not as bad
Bitmin,I've done a fair bit of reading on poker so I like to think I'm pretty decent when I'm full tryharding
Bitmin,But doing that means folding like 70%+ of hands so I rarely do
Bitmin,It just becomes boring for everyone
Bitmin,Pls play
Bitmin,You're just folding most of the time anyways
Bitmin,What the heck
Bitmin,truth
Bitmin,Chris I'll play as soon as I'm home
Bitmin,Your game then poker
Bitmin,I mean is that not pro poker anyways
Bitmin,foding 70% sounds about right
Bitmin,"Like I said, that is the correct way to play if you want to win, it just is more fun to play a lot of hands."
Bitmin,according to my dad i'm weird in that i play the same whether or not money is involved
Bitmin,I would never play poker for real money
Bitmin,i mean even for somehting liek 5 bucks
Bitmin,I am opposed to gambling
Bitmin,fair enough i suppose
Bitmin,@Trapezoider we playin poker soon or wha t
Bitmin,Did y’all end up actually playing poker
Bitmin,Hello
Bitmin,No we did not
Bitmin,I thought I would be home sooner
Bitmin,But repairing my window took longer than expected
Bitmin,Smh
Bitmin,@Zain Can you use your mode powers to get me a massive CSV of every message sent in chillin ?
Bitmin,I'm not sure that is possible
Bitmin,This is so sad
Bitmin,I'm learning about language models
Bitmin,and I wanted to train a net to generate text that is basically the average of frostbite
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Just go highlight everything
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I would also like to see some data science with the chat
Bitmin,you could probably make a bot that would just scrape the entirety of a channel
Bitmin,Like who has sent the most messages etc.
Bitmin,"I'm not positive cause I""ve never worked with discord's api 'n stuff, but it should be doable"
Bitmin,Its totally possible i recalla  friend of mine doing something similar
Bitmin,not for frostbite obvs but
Bitmin,Can you reach out to him and find out how
Bitmin,I could train something by the end of the day
Bitmin,It would be like the olive garden commercials
Bitmin,sounds neat

Bitmin,what have they done to discord light theme
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I don't use that shit
Bitmin,they made it so ugly
Bitmin,like soooo ugly
Bitmin,Insinuating that it wasn't already ugly
Bitmin,What did they change?
Bitmin,they removed the darker parts and just made everything the lighter version so now there's no more contrast and logical grouping of things that go together and everything just sorta blends together and looks awful
Bitmin,and I don't know why they thought it was an improvement
Bitmin,my best guess is they've just decided to drive the last holdouts over to dark theme and then delete light mode
Bitmin,OH ITS AWFUL

Bitmin,"Millennials, also known as Generation Y (or simply Gen Y), are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted definition. Millennials are sometimes referred to as ""echo boomers"" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The characteristics of millennials vary by region and by individual, and the group experiences a variety of social and economic conditions, but they are generally marked by their coming of age in the Information Age, and are comfortable in their usage of digital technologies and social media."

Bitmin,I'm learning it for work and its D O P E 
Bitmin,just use vue or react
Bitmin,vue is actually nutty
Bitmin,I learned it in like fifteen minutes and it's beautiful
Bitmin,Seems like a powerful framework. Unfortunately the sunk cost fallacy is making me want to continue down the angular path
Bitmin,I'm already 5 hours down the rabbit hole
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"that's some weak sunk cost, unless you're working on existing angular stuff at which point you should probably just suck it up"
Bitmin,Well now im 6 hours in bro
Bitmin,this sunk cost is getting bigger
Bitmin,stop sinking costs unless it's crucial that the thing you learn is angular
Bitmin,otherwise learn vue or react

Bitmin,Andrew Yang Unofficial Anime opening
Bitmin,2020 democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang's unofficial anime opening I made in 3 weeks. Hope ya'll like it!  Please show your support @ patreon.com...
Bitmin,Thoughts on yang? 
Bitmin,He's no Ace Watkins
Bitmin,He's cool but he's no beghoul
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"bored between classes so I made a tier list, come give me shit for my shit opinions"
Bitmin,why does it only go to C tier
Bitmin,because the game's well enough balanced that it doesn't need to go further down
Bitmin,"I've seen games that don't go below B tier (shoutouts to UNIST, although technically it has Enkidu tier, containing just Enkidu, because he is terrible. Still got 5th at evo though.)"
Bitmin,I'll have my tier list out in a few days
Bitmin,So I will refrain from commenting for now
Bitmin,cloud needs to be lower
Bitmin,he's in b- tier
Bitmin,there's a reason why the 2 best cloud players are dropping cloud and why i'm taking a break from smash
Bitmin,"eeeh I don't think he's that low, but I might have put him a bit high. He's still got good tools and I feel like he mops up a solid chunk of the characters below him"
Bitmin,but there's just characters who are more or less better cloud
Bitmin,what tools? when all his moves have 0 priority and trade with almost anything
Bitmin,"they aren't that bad, and they're pretty safe, if not plus. Also he has solid juggling and deals hella damage, and always has a comeback/blowup factor because his callout tools (fsmash, anything with limit) are really strong"
Bitmin,UPAIR LOSES AND TRADES WITH BOWSER NAIR
Bitmin,FUCKING BOWSER NAIR
Bitmin,you can't tell me cloud has good shit
Bitmin,when i've played him the most
Bitmin,bowser nair is amazing what are you talking about
Bitmin,everything loses to bowser nair
Bitmin,barring insane disjoints
Bitmin,hense my point. cloud sucks
Bitmin,"which cloud doesn't have anymore, he only has moderate disjooints"
Bitmin,losing to something that almost everyone else also loses to does not make your character bad
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,Benson your point there made no sense
Bitmin,my point is that cloud's juggling game isnt great
Bitmin,he struggles to kill
Bitmin,and his disjoints suck
Bitmin,his moves have no priority
Bitmin,and his recovery is bad
Bitmin,I'd like to point out that everything you just mentioned except the recovery thing applies to the entire chunk immediately above him
Bitmin,"duck hunt,  the links, g&w, shulk"
Bitmin,shulk at least has decent disjoints but also his juggling sucks
Bitmin,and the poor boy can't kill without putting himself hugely at risk
Bitmin,he has smash art
Bitmin,at least that helps
Bitmin,"which puts him hugely at risk as well, it's terrible for closing out games or making comebacks"
Bitmin,also a great way to lose leads
Bitmin,"but yes, he's a better character than cloud, which is why he's near the top of the tier as opposed to the bottom"
Bitmin,cloud has a hard time dealing with people who constantly run away + sometimes can't kill until he lands a unstale move or throw at 220%
Bitmin,on top of that his grab sucks balls
Bitmin,yeah he's got issues
Bitmin,but so does everyone at this point in the list
Bitmin,"and he's able to safely poke with kill moves, which is a big deal"
Bitmin,unless it's perfectly spaced in which it only hits the shield and not aimed at the opponent then yes
Bitmin,but other than that
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,his bair is safe only if you spot dodge
Bitmin,and his fair loses to fast oos options
Bitmin,also parrying is a thing
Bitmin,which makes bair unsafe
Bitmin,which is his safest move
Bitmin,yeah but parrying makes... basically everything unsafe
Bitmin,so it's not a super valid issue
Bitmin,@Max @Sak von Sak @TheRainbowpixelz @The Rona anyone down for some smash
Bitmin,wanna play some ike
Bitmin,"got another lecture in 20 minutes, I'd be down after that tho"
Bitmin,just got back from class
Bitmin,so in like an hour and a half or so
Bitmin,i have class later 
Bitmin,at 5
Bitmin,also kameron come shit on my tier list
Bitmin,I'll play
Bitmin,your tier list trash
Bitmin,or join the argument about how I placed cloud
Bitmin,cloud sucks and is bottom of mid tier
Bitmin,"you put mega man, zss, chrom, ness, gren, pac, shulk way too low"
Bitmin,"I don't think zss deserves to be any higher imo, and the rest might be a bit better but I feel like results on them are all dropping off (except shulk)"
Bitmin,imagine thinking mega man and pac results are dropping off
Bitmin,I may have just not seen any
Bitmin,kameme won an s tier 
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,solo mm?
Bitmin,p much
Bitmin,mostly megaman
Bitmin,hm might move him to like around pac then
Bitmin,bowser being above pac and mega man is a joke
Bitmin,megaman is better than bowser
Bitmin,not sure about pac
Bitmin,well :/ it depends  on the mu
Bitmin,they are not characters I know a ton about
Bitmin,it wasn't exactly an extensively researched tier list
Bitmin,most of megaman and pac is theory crafting
Bitmin,judging the megaman placing by japanese players at evo megaman and duck hunt have gone up in my tier lsit
Bitmin,but there's still not enough information via games to justify if they are actually good or not
Bitmin,"we'll see, my assumption is that like most not-super-popular characters that are being labbed out, there'll be a bunch of new tech found, their results will shoot up, then people will start figuring out the matchup and the results will drop a bit, but still be noticeably higher than initially"
Bitmin,"so it's hard to say at what point any characters like that are, especially if you're me and haven't even noticed the good results"
Bitmin,you've seen that duck hunt and how much safe pressure it can put out
Bitmin,with pac-man ive already seen people learn how to play around his neutral b galiga
Bitmin,we just have to wait and see more to fully get a grasp on these zoners

Bitmin,if Puppeh beats Salem we get a rematch of Leffen Salem
Bitmin,@Eric Working From Home do you have the stonks you made of me?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,@Trapezoider nah i didnt save them
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I got you covered @Trapezoider
Bitmin,the folder pogu
Bitmin,leffen beat puppeh what
Bitmin,Yo @Jed how do you like Hot Lava?
Bitmin,for people who work as broadcast talent what if they sneeze
Bitmin,they just dont sneeze
Bitmin,They have a mute button
Bitmin,You can sometimes hear coughs through the other caster's mic if you listen carefully
Bitmin,but you can see people sneeze
Bitmin,The commentators are not on cam all the time
Bitmin,i didnt even say commentators
Bitmin,i said broadcast talent
Bitmin,ie newscasters
Bitmin,@The Rona thank homie
Bitmin,You're welcome
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane i saw a dude sneeze on my local news station he just said sorry for that and went on
Bitmin,Fascinating

Bitmin,Would you rather...
Bitmin,Vote Now! [Dig a ditch (in moderate weather)] [Do Research]
Bitmin,thoughts?
Bitmin,Melee might be more fun with only battlefield tbh
Bitmin,id be down to ban puff
Bitmin,That would be even better
Bitmin,Banning things to make the game more fun is perfectly fine in my opinion
Bitmin,Like TF2 6s does
Bitmin,tf2 6s wasnt really banning things
Bitmin,it was building a competitive game from the ground up
Bitmin,If heavy had GRU and his slowing minigun legal he would have seen play
Bitmin,it was a 'constructive ruleset'
Bitmin,"When hungrybox is in attendance, Ultimate top 8 probably has a faster average game speed. How depressing that one character can slow down an entire game."
Bitmin,Just ban Hungrybox
Bitmin,when he is maybe gonna lose he plays lame
Bitmin,
Bitmin,puff encourages non-interaction
Bitmin,Characters should not have multiple jumps
Bitmin,Meta knight had the same issue of air camping
Bitmin,air camping inherently limits the options of your opponent making it bad to approach
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,What does that mean
Bitmin,It was listing his most common moves for neutral wins and kills.
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane do you not want to do research?
Bitmin,dreamland is basically impossible for marth vs puff cause pivot tipper doesnt kill until the percents dont work anymore
Bitmin,It connects and kills during an 8% window
Bitmin,lol thats miserable
Bitmin,melee is now the lame game that holds up the fun smash game
Bitmin,how the turns table
Bitmin,how sad
Bitmin,oh boy i cant wait to watch axe/amsa vs hbox again 
Bitmin,a real fun 30 minute long set
Bitmin,bless axe for not going pika
Bitmin,and making grands faster
Bitmin,
Bitmin,So many hype ultimate matchups incoming
Bitmin,except i have classes tomorrow feelsbadman
Bitmin,westcoast tournies suck
Bitmin,i wanna see marss leo cause marss was playing hot earlier

Bitmin,"@Master Memers @Advanced Memers 

I wanna do a frostbite fitness challenge for the month of BROVEMBER. If I set something up with prizes would you all compete? It's just an idea, I don't have anything concrete planned"
Bitmin,What metrics would you be tracking
Bitmin,If its in inches i'm out
Bitmin,"It depends on what the fitness challenge is. Maybe its ""Who can achieve the highest proportional increase in weight lifting"" or ""Who can keep the highest average heart rate over the month??"" IDK

I know the bois are tryna get fit. Way easier to achieve when you gamify it and do it with friends"
Bitmin,All ideas are appreciated
Bitmin,@TheRainbowpixelz Im the one with the chode here
Bitmin,Also my heart rate went up to 190 for a solid 7 hours earlier this month. So i guess i win that one

Bitmin,It doesn't have to be I just wanted a cool month name
Bitmin,BROVEMBER
Bitmin,GainTober?
Bitmin,Muscle March
Bitmin,Etc
Bitmin,I don’t think bench is a good metric to measure tho cause for instance me and Chris rock climb and although it’s good exercise it doesn’t increase my bench by any noticeable amount cause it doesn’t require those muscle groups
Bitmin,weak bitch cant bench

Bitmin,could be wrong tho
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,but it looks so gamer
Bitmin,I bought it
Bitmin,(current mouse is dying)
Bitmin,which is weird cause my mouse i can put extra weights in to make ti heavier
Bitmin,which i do
Bitmin,I actually like lighter mice
Bitmin,doesn't have the same heft but also it just feels super free and easy
Bitmin,idk for me it feels like i can be more accurate with a heavier mouse
Bitmin,prob cause im adjusted to it now tho
Bitmin,also I do a lot of my mousing with my fingers and wrist rather than my arm
Bitmin,so light is a lot easier

Bitmin,"There is a movie ""End of Evangelion"""
Bitmin,That fixes the ending
Bitmin,FR???
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,THANK GOD
Bitmin,I was kind of dissatisfied 
Bitmin,you should still watch the zero budget TV series end though because its funny
Bitmin,Thanks for letting me know buddy
Bitmin,It was really zero budget?
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,I thought this was supposed to be intentionally artsy
Bitmin,but they did have some problems
Bitmin,it was not meant to be like this
Bitmin,Thats good to know
Bitmin,yeah they flat out ran out of money
Bitmin,oof
Bitmin,which is hilarious to me since it ended up being one of the most profitable anime franchises ever
Bitmin,just... not during production
Bitmin,it's weird how iconic that show is
Bitmin,like I bet if you played the theme song
Bitmin,most people would recognize it and go
Bitmin,hmmm I know this song but not where it is from
Bitmin,"There is a video called something like ""Can you live entirely off Evangelion Merchandise?"". There is so much of it that you basically can."
Bitmin,spoilers
Bitmin,I'm reading online
Bitmin,"and people are saying ""They ran out of money"" is a myth"
Bitmin,can someone source this please?
Bitmin,They had problems with the original ending being too similar to a terrorist attack and thought it would be in poor taste to release it is the long answer.
Bitmin,"honestly it's not that weird that the show ended up being as iconic as it was, at least within anime. It kinda revolutionized an entire genre and brought a ton of new ideas and directions into the medium and is a huge part of why anime is the way it is, but despite that no one's quite managed to replicate what made it work. The weird thing is that it's so recognizable to people who don't know much of anything about anime"
Bitmin,facts
Bitmin,"I didn't know what the show was until gigukk made the ""Basically, Netflix's Evangelion"""
Bitmin,But before seeing that I had inadvertently seen tons of references to the show around the internet
Bitmin,It was a good watch

Bitmin,@Ultimate ?
Bitmin,There's a common concept that to be really good at something you first have to suck at it and fail a bunch
Bitmin,However usually people who end up really good at something start fairly good at the thing
Bitmin,Yes
Bitmin,So it's a dumb and ultimately harmful concept
Bitmin,You are only getting half of that right
Bitmin,"Your ability to master any skill is pretty much directly related to your IQ. 

Two dudes start learning a game for instance. Jim's IQ is 130 while Bob's is 100. 

If they both practice 8 hours a day, by the end of the month Jim is pretty much guaranteed to be way better than Bob. 

When they started they both sucked and failed to play the game well. What differentiates them is the Jim was able to learn and reduce his failures/attempts WAY faster than Bob."
Bitmin,TLRD: To be good at something you do have to fail... BUT your number of failures will be vastly lower than someone with a lower IQ and you will master the skill quicker.
Bitmin,Okay get the fuck out of here. You did not just start typing the MOMENT I open discord @Mr. Airplane

Bitmin,It's probably safer than driving a car
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,Not you
Bitmin,lmao yeah I said that to my mom
Bitmin,I mean is true
Bitmin,Just cause something seems scary
Bitmin,Doesn't mean it is scary

Bitmin,I get the basic idea but the math is just so badly explained here
Bitmin,This video is god mode
Bitmin,The math makes so much sense
Bitmin,Skip around and get what you need
Bitmin,It helped me 10/10
Bitmin,
Bitmin,honestly I've totally given up on this for tonight
Bitmin,I'll watch it at some point
Bitmin,it might not even be on the test
Bitmin,Coolio
Bitmin,Part 4-7 are great intuitive lessons on neural nets and the maths
Bitmin,8-12 is Computer Vision stuff you probably aren't worried about
Bitmin,holy shit andrew
Bitmin,I want this man as my prof
Bitmin,I'm half an hour in and I've already learned more about back propagation than in like.... four lectures with my actual prof
Bitmin,it's not even complicated
Bitmin,wtf actual prof
Bitmin,why would you only give the raw math and not the super intuitive explanation of why this shit works
Bitmin,RIGHT
Bitmin,IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE WHEN HE EXPLAINS IT THIS WAY
Bitmin,Make sure to share this with your classmates!!!

Bitmin,yeah

Bitmin,and also just works really hard
Bitmin,yep hard work and a lotta time dedication can get you pretty far
Bitmin,but you also have to be smart about it. I spent years making super slow progress because I was really stupid about how I was going about drawing
Bitmin,Yeah but I mean for really skilled artists like me our talents just develope naturally
Bitmin,I guess that's just absolute savants

Bitmin,"So as many of you know I've started a new campaign and for this one i wanted to have an introduction so that there could something in between starting situation and when the players actually started to play. When i was going about writing this i said to myself it would really suck if i were to fuck this up when i have to read it so why not just record it and play it for the players over some music. I decided ultimately to not do that and it went perfectly fine but while i did not put into practice my recording idea i did however record 30 clips of me trying to record this introduction and on all of the 29 clips i failed. I ended up getting pretty mad the last one in this video was perfect, but all the rest are just me raging so i asked some people if they wanted to see it and they said they did so here for your enjoyment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YFx7qlhq0&feature=youtu.be"

It's only worth ~6% of my mark, and as far as I've been able to tell I'm following the instructions to a T and it's not working (so I assume I'm misunderstanding something, but I have no idea what). Went for office hours and the TA just never showed up. I could go in for a different TA's office hours tomorrow (it's due tonight so I'd be taking late marks but I'd still get most of the grades), but with all the other stuff I have on my plate I honestly think it might not be worth it."

Bitmin,or is it just my incineroar and lucario
Bitmin,just cause you're annoying doesnt mean the chars are idiot
Bitmin,touché

Bitmin,on the flip side I have so many boxes of whippets
Bitmin,Uhhhhh
Bitmin,Please tell me whippets are something else in canada
Bitmin,Isn't that a drug?
Bitmin,lol no
Bitmin,It's nitrous oxide in canisters and you huff it
Bitmin,But I assume it's something else
Bitmin,Unless Canada has some lit grocery stores
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Ah
Bitmin,I see
Bitmin,they are very addicting though
Bitmin,but usually more expensive than I would pay for
Bitmin,but it was 2 boxes for $5 as opposed to one box for $3.50
Bitmin,oh i thought whippets were dogs
Bitmin,they are that as well
Bitmin,two boxes of dogs for $5 would be pretty amazing
Bitmin,although that'd be a lot of dogs to take care of
Bitmin,but I could probably sell them at a reasonable markup
Bitmin,i wonder how many dogs comes in one box
Bitmin,@Ultimate anyone downs?
Bitmin,thats a little personal of a question dont ya think

Bitmin,I also use this
Bitmin,Except mine is black
Bitmin,I should get one
Bitmin,I just need a way to set up a push to talk that I can use while playing a game with a controller. My current thought is some kind of foot pedal.
Bitmin,Just use a button on the controller
Bitmin,
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,I don't have any free buttons on my GC controller that would be convenient to press while playing
Bitmin,Just use auto detect

Bitmin,you fought the spirit of my frustration at this neural nets assignment
Bitmin,yoshi link might be 100 0
Bitmin,that matchup feels very impossible
Bitmin,@Trapezoider @The Rona Rocket launched

Bitmin,Kingston Smash Ultimate 2019 - Weekly #39 - Challonge
Bitmin,"(also got 7th in melee, was one stock away from beating #3 in the city too but then I choked, and continued my unbroken string of 2nd places in unist, although I took a game off the best player in the city this time)"
Bitmin,Nice losers run
Bitmin,thanks :)
Bitmin,I played such a weird mix of characters
Bitmin,but like 2/3 incineroar and it worked really well
Bitmin,I made one guy soooo mad and ended up getting my first PR win for the season
Bitmin,"he won game 1, I took game 2, then he swapped off his main (dedede) for roy which was hilarious cause of all those incineroar-roy games I played against max where I learned to cheese the poor boy (runoff lariat), then he pulled a PT and I showed him why you don't try to zone out incineroar"
Bitmin,I feel bad for him. Incineroar would be in gouge eyes out tier of my annoying tier list.
Bitmin,yeah a little bit
Bitmin,I played some Bowser today
Bitmin,oh no
Bitmin,man is easy
Bitmin,are we gonna have three
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,yeah he's pretty straight forward
Bitmin,I just wanted to prove a point
Bitmin,have I ever pretended like he's not easy?
Bitmin,That wasn't the point. I was proving that he is good.
Bitmin,I always thought he was pretty good too?
Bitmin,he's at worst upper mid tier
Bitmin,These points were not directed at you
Bitmin,fair
Bitmin,I learned some new ledge trapping tricks with Palu as well in my session today against Benson.
Bitmin,I also finally hit this one unist combo in a real match for once
Bitmin,the one and only time I get to feel like mika actually has good damage
Bitmin,"costs half my meter as a starter though, and the other half as the ender, but it does like 50% of most characters health"
Bitmin,"was also the first time I didn't feel totally outmatched against harley (he did still 3-1 3-0 me between winner's and grand finals, but most of the games were really close)"
Bitmin,Have you lost to him for every 2nd place finish?
Bitmin,"naw, the weeks he wasn't there I lost to different people -_-"
Bitmin,but he is responsible for most of them
Bitmin,ay I just found that discord has a setting that puts light theme pretty much back to how it used to be
Bitmin,it's not quite as good but now I have a better alternative to dark mode so I'm going for it
Bitmin,dark sidebar pog
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,although the old light theme had a lighter grey for the sidebar
Bitmin,it also had a darker bit for the users sidebar
Bitmin,but it's still better than all dark
Bitmin,but new light theme kinda nice tho

Bitmin,"You can talk about the importance of participating in a democracy. Cite low voter turnout percentages, and encourage voting in the next election."
Bitmin,yeah but im pretty sure that the person right before me is doing that already
Bitmin,the environment one
Bitmin,oh snap voting could be good
Bitmin,except that i dont do it
Bitmin,Do they know that though

Bitmin,what else do you have to do
Bitmin,@Trapezoider csgo?
Bitmin,i am watching stuff
Bitmin,"weekly summary:
7th in melee, lost to 1st and 2nd place, had pretty close sets against both of em (last stock game 3 with 2nd, two last hit games with 1st)

5th in ultimate, lost to 1st and 4th. Got bodied by the guy who won, game 5 last hit with the 4th place guy (who I kinda sorta hate as a human being and he said he'd quit if he ever lost to incineroar, so I'm real sad about that)

2nd in unist as always, but probably featured the ""highlight"" of the weekly, where between the last game of winner's finals and first two games of grands, I landed one hit. In those three games (six rounds) I was perfected 5 times. I have never been so completely destroyed in any game ever. Not playing melee against Ryan Ford or Moky, or ringing for plat 6s when I was in steel. Holy fuck I got completely and utterly shredded."
Bitmin,I also ate an excellent burrito that was far beyond my capacity for spiciness but it was so damn good that I kept taking these huge bites and then dying for the next five minutes then being really excited to take another bite
Bitmin,My younger self resonates with this so much

Bitmin,@Cs:go any1?
Bitmin,Youtub
Bitmin,Can yousend me the link I couldn't find it
Bitmin,@Cs:go
Bitmin,need a fifth
Bitmin,Someone just sent me a pic on Snapchat of them holding a pumpkin spiced latte and saying “still holding onto those fall vibes”
Bitmin,Like ofc you are it’s still fall you dumb bitch
Bitmin,"I think theyre saying that the ""fall vibes"" have become tangible through the latte that theyve had for a while"
Bitmin,kinda deep if you think about it
Bitmin,Ok push guy
Bitmin,Ok now I go this way
Bitmin,People in r/smashbros don't understand how balance work
Bitmin,Actually neither do blizzard tbh
Bitmin,Whenever you talk about the general public
Bitmin,They generally have no idea how to balance a game
Bitmin,you aren't supposed to buff bad character's weakness or nerf good character's strengths
Bitmin,you buff bad character's inherent strengths and nerf good characters inherent weaknesses
Bitmin,that keeps characters different and interesting
Bitmin,like people on r/smashbros are saying to buff incineroar's speed
Bitmin,but that would not make any sense with how incineroar works as a character
Bitmin,he's slow because his moves are really good and cover a lot of space
Bitmin,same as people who wanted to nerf roadhog's hook but make him more tanky
Bitmin,the tradeoff for roadhog was that he can have a high burst damage output but you risk dieing and feeding ult charge
Bitmin,oh god fast incineroar would be horrifying
Bitmin,but hurr durr he a tank he shouldnt do damage but he should have damage resistances like every other tank that already exists but have more utility than hog when you remove his hook's usefullness
Bitmin,also yea fast incineroar would be stupid
Bitmin,just let PT play as any three pokemon
Bitmin,he'd just be better bowser
Bitmin,why would you want that r/smashbros
Bitmin,not pt incin
Bitmin,becasue r/smashbros is not a particularly smart environment
Bitmin,but like these are core concepts of game balance
Bitmin,also that was a suggestion for a different dumb change
Bitmin,it would be funny
Bitmin,like preschooler level stuff
Bitmin,but also wack as fuck
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,you only nerf a strong character's strengths if you didn't actually mean to make it a strength/overdid it
Bitmin,you dont remove characters weaknesses when they bad or every char is gonna feel the same
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,like it's good that sm4sh took out diddy down throw up air up air up air
Bitmin,and made bayo stuff less consistent (for all the good that did)
Bitmin,like the only change I would make to pika is make him bigger or make his moves do less damage
Bitmin,but in general if you take away both strengths and weaknesses you end up with a bland cast
Bitmin,because fast safe moves and an insane recover are supposed to be pika's strengths
Bitmin,imo I'd make him upb on stage more punishable
Bitmin,but being small and doing a lot of damage are not
Bitmin,it's kind of a dumb neutral tool
Bitmin,yea mayb
Bitmin,but that would fall into your thing of a strength being too strong
Bitmin,like joker for example is a fundementally broken char
Bitmin,"but yeah his whole point is that he's small, fast, and has high-execution stuff that's really good"
Bitmin,because his strengths and weaknesses do not adhere to the design of the game
Bitmin,yeah he's a weird one
Bitmin,I can't really think of a good way to fix him without totally redesigning him as a character
Bitmin,so he should be changed entirely imo
Bitmin,also some parts of his kit are just crazy overtuned
Bitmin,like down gun
Bitmin,I mean really you just gotta change how arsene and down gun work
Bitmin,and side b doing like 17
Bitmin,and his arsene moves having hitboxes the size of bowser
Bitmin,but yea arsene coming from taking damage makes no sense
Bitmin,and hitting him with arsene should make it go away very quickly
Bitmin,"I'd say just make it so that if he eats a certain number of attacks he just loses arsense automatically, so if you hit him with like four moves (not four hits, four moves) he's back to normal"
Bitmin,or just like
Bitmin,yea
Bitmin,make him more in line with the game he's from
Bitmin,and just have arsene for his specials
Bitmin,and his normals are his normals
Bitmin,or maybe 25 damage and arsene goes away
Bitmin,he'd still be really good but not as dumb
Bitmin,but he gets arsene by dealing 30 damage
Bitmin,or make it time based idk
Bitmin,or go the p4a route of if you hit him with arsene out enough times he just has no arsene for the whole stock
Bitmin,meh characters changing based on stock stuff like that is kinda dumb imo
Bitmin,eh maybe
Bitmin,like lucario
Bitmin,or krool
Bitmin,krool?
Bitmin,his belly can break
Bitmin,oh right
Bitmin,or wonderwing
Bitmin,but banjo is just lame tho
Bitmin,also I gotta say I hate that arsene is such a bad mechanic because the visual design for arsene is so damn cool
Bitmin,but in smash it's such an anti-fun mechanic
Bitmin,and also you can barely see him
Bitmin,it really be tho
Bitmin,zack why dont you play joker
Bitmin,cause he's not all that fun imo
Bitmin,I don't like having to rely on arsene or tricky setups for my kills
Bitmin,I really wanted to like him

Bitmin,Paradise Lost might be up there as one of the works books I've ever been forced to read
Bitmin,By Milton?
Bitmin,No the other paradise lost
Bitmin,They buffed incineroar's neutral b a bunch 
Bitmin,Spin move time
Bitmin,Spin move!
Bitmin,patch notes?
Bitmin,also WHY did they buff incineroar neutral b
Bitmin,move's already mad good
Bitmin,Also Terry is out already
Bitmin,We play later tonight lads @Ultimate
Bitmin,Time to pick up another character
Bitmin,lol they buffed incineroar neutral b... third hit
Bitmin,just specifically the third hit
Bitmin,of like five
Bitmin,They buffed the rest of the move too keep reading
Bitmin,(oh wait that was jabs I'm dumb)
Bitmin,that is a big yikes
Bitmin,and revenge lasts longer and has less end lag
Bitmin,fair got a bit nerfed though? hard to tell
Bitmin,either they added a weak hitbox or they really extended the weak hitbox I can't tell
Bitmin,Terry appearantly is kinda nice
Bitmin,No Palu nerfs
Bitmin,I'm satisfied
Bitmin,I'm definitely a little upset they buffed Incineroar though
Bitmin,I mean he doesn't have any new goofy stuff
Bitmin,just some of his old goofy stuff is better
Bitmin,I still don't think it's enough for me to solo main him
Bitmin,"(also, probably won't immediately be joining ultimate stuff tonight, some of my housemates who play traditional fighters want to learn, and also I'm gonna be learning some soul caliber, so I probably won't be around until pretty late)"
Bitmin,I have a test tomorrow so I will be trying Terry offline for like 5 minutes but won't be here to play online games.
Bitmin,
Bitmin,just study now and we can play later
Bitmin,I have to go to class now
Bitmin,I just woke up
Bitmin,
Bitmin,oh dear terry has double quarter circle inputs
Bitmin,and also what appears to be ghetto qc back half circle forwards
Bitmin,this is what we get for KoF characters

Ok, and if you did play with friends, you would want to play with the homies right? Then hypothetically speaking, there would be a frostbite poker night. Now, let's say its tonight.

Now that we have established that there will be a poker night and the homies are invited, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that it would be fun. Am I not correct? A group of the homies deserves poker night, so I suggest that we play poker."""

Bitmin,and then dog was playing luigi instead of his usual sheik
Bitmin,and his usual sheik fucks me up

Bitmin,"Got 33rd (3-2) at an ultimate regional, which I'm okay with given that both players I lost to finished 7th. I couldn't plausibly have done better given my seeding and I feel like I played pretty well. Also I made another campy player really mad about Incineroar which is always nice. Didn't even need revenge, just knowing that a) dash attack picks up banana and you're diddy so I don't care about the tiny punish you might get from that, b) while holding banana I still have access to sideb, lariat, and upb, and c) banana -> sideb is a thing Incineroar can do."

Bitmin,"“I don’t think I’ll have kids”
- Boring
- Invites argument

“My bloodline dies with me”
- Assertive
- Metal as fuck
- Implies you’re taking on a great noble burden which allows no arguments"
Bitmin,ty devon very cool
Bitmin,Me and Joan were discussing antinatalism and my 7 month pregnant boss walked in
Bitmin,I’ll keep y’all posted if I still have a job next week
Bitmin,Antinatalism is super toxic
Bitmin,It's up there with the death acceptance movement as one of my least favorite philosophical positions.
Bitmin,"Holdup why is the death acceptance movement one of your least favourite positions, I’m genuinely trying to find anything somebody could object to about it"
Bitmin,I have no idea why anyone would want to die given the alternative.
Bitmin,Suffering?
Bitmin,Eternal life is the ultimate goal of all medical research. Death and aging cause so much suffering that to end it would be a triumph unparalleled for all time.
Bitmin,Death acceptance is not a debate on medical suicide if that's what you were thinking
Bitmin,It means opposing eternal life
Bitmin,If that’s your stance then I don’t see how you can be antinatalism if you think living forever is the end goal then obv once we can live forever we need to stop having kids
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,We need to expand to other planets
Bitmin,So I understand the death acceptance movement and given the opportunity to have eternal life I would decline
Bitmin,There’s no point in living without dying imo
Bitmin,That is so contrary to my own belief I cannot comprehend why anyone would ever think that.
Bitmin,Eternal life is cool but if eternal life means an eternity of floating in the middle of space aimlessly while i lose my mind id rather not
Bitmin,"Would you ask the grim reaper to bring you blindness, weakness, ugliness, and an end to your relatives and yourself if he were a real entity. Why not just ask for nothing and lead a more enjoyable existence."
Bitmin,Eternal life doesn't mean you literally exist until the end of the universe
Bitmin,@Rotomotorz
Bitmin,"Watch CGP Grey's video ""why die"" for a great overview of my position"
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,Floating in the middle of space aimlessly
Bitmin,i.e.
Bitmin,just you floating in space
Bitmin,no ground for you to stand on
Bitmin,no like in a shuttle
Bitmin,not literally just you
Bitmin,The concept of one day you will die gives life more purpose and meaning IMO
Bitmin,"Also  @Max , does your idea of eternal life also include eternal youth?"
Bitmin,Yes of course. The research of the two go hand in hand.
Bitmin,"Okay, that's what I thought"
Bitmin,One will be a natural result of the other
Bitmin,But I wanted to make sure
Bitmin,"Also @Eric Working From Home , you will still eventually die"
Bitmin,In your uptown world is capitalism abolished or are human wage slaves for eternity
Bitmin,It's just about delaying that for as long as possible
Bitmin,Would you beat your child to make the days you don't beat him more enjoyable?
Bitmin,Utopian**
Bitmin,@Max that is so far from the point it’s mind boggling
Bitmin,Death giving life meaning is analogous to what I said
Bitmin,wait yeah thats definitely not analogous
Bitmin,I mean it bigly ain’t
Bitmin,If you think so then you don't understand my position
Bitmin,The concept of dying means your days are numbered and gives motivation to enjoy you days as you can
Bitmin,If you could live forever you’d have no motivation to accomplish anything
Bitmin,Maybe if you are lazy
Bitmin,I think it would lead to even greater progress since humans would never have to reset their knowledge pool
Bitmin,what gives people motivation during endless life
Bitmin,tho
Bitmin,Life is meaning in itself
Bitmin,I guess if you don't share that position none of my others make any sense
Bitmin,I have to go to class now
Bitmin,Perhaps but what do you plan to do with the people who view otherwise
Bitmin,Let them die obviously
Bitmin,so then endless life is a choice?
Bitmin,Why wouldn't it be
Bitmin,or is it given to only select individuals
Bitmin,And if its a choice what do you do with those of no ambition that choose to live forever
Bitmin,Not many people instictively wabt to die
Bitmin,People should have the option of death should they choose
Bitmin,I can consent to dying I couldn’t consent to being born
Bitmin,Like what if everybody all stopped having kids and humanity just lived in this utopian society until we all eventually died out and then the earth can try again in 1000000 years once primates evolve to our level
Bitmin,That’s the dream right there baby
Bitmin,Why would we not want ourselves to evolve?
Bitmin,Why would we want to end as homo sapiens?
Bitmin,When we could become homo superior?
Bitmin,What you propose is literally the opposite of what life tries to do
Bitmin,Life doesn’t take ethics and morality into account
Bitmin,Life doesn’t care if it’s ethically and morally wrong to have a child
Bitmin,I don't think it needs to
Bitmin,It just wants you to procreate and die
Bitmin,It supercedes all things
Bitmin,ethics and morality are mere concepts that we as humans have come up with
Bitmin,Life is a concept not an entity
Bitmin,Aren’t ethics and morality what we view and making us different and superior to non sentient races
Bitmin,Living != surviving
Bitmin,Life doesn't need to be an entity to supercede other concepts
Bitmin,If you are of the opinion that we should be slaves to the machinations of life then why oppose death
Bitmin,One merely exists because of the other
Bitmin,I also don't understand how procreation would be ethically or morally wrong
Bitmin,"A child can’t consent to being born, a child is burdened by the implications of society without being given a choose and inversely society is burdened by another person to cause damage to others and the world"
Bitmin,If you want a kid then adopt one
Bitmin,"There’s only three reasons to birth a child: ignorance, narcissism or both."
Bitmin,"That is a pretty narrow statement though, don't you think?"
Bitmin,What about that is narrow
Bitmin,Just because something cannot consent to being born doesn't mean that it is unhappy because it was
Bitmin,Also
Bitmin,It only takes into account the morality and ethics side of life
Bitmin,"We don’t owe life, it will persist regardless of our actions so why should we slave to it"
Bitmin,Why shouldn't I owe life? It allows me to exist and be who I am today. Passing on my own genes doesn't mean that I am a slave to life
Bitmin,So you want to have children to pass on your genes
Bitmin,It also gives others the chance to experience what life has to offer
Bitmin,I realize that this could be interpreted as your both statement
Bitmin,but so what?
Bitmin,Why don’t we just agree to disagree then cause it seems we are at an impasse
Bitmin,
Bitmin,This is 100% topic
Bitmin,But
Bitmin,I just got my schedule for next term
Bitmin,"and again, I only got 3 of the classes that I enrolled for"
Bitmin,Bruh hunt down the guy making the schedules
Bitmin,That’s bogus
Bitmin,So I went to look at all the class schedules
Bitmin,To see what was causing the conflict
Bitmin,and
Bitmin,There isn't any
Bitmin,There is literally no conflict
Bitmin,I didn't get put into these classes for reasons unknown
Bitmin,These classes are still open by the way
Bitmin,And they are also only available during winter

Bitmin,damn
Bitmin,also I am so bad at melee now I need to train
Bitmin,on the flip side kingston's gotten free enough that I'm expecting to be somewhere in the 5-7 range
Bitmin,miiiiiight squeeze onto the ultimate PR as well but I'm more likely to be on the honourable mentions bit
Bitmin,I'd guess I'd fall in the like 10-12 range
Bitmin,kingston weak
Bitmin,kingston ultimate actually kinda stacked
Bitmin,we have an ontario pr and a former ontario pr and neither of them is our best player
Bitmin,"also, at the tourney today we ran doubles, I ended up teaming in melee with a guy who's not all that good (generally goes 1-2 or 2-2, has no PR wins for the season) on the semi-arbitrary recommendation of dayman and we ended up going pretty hard - beat a team of #3 in the city and a guy around my level, and we were the only team to take a game off the team that won

we placed third, which doesn't seem all that impressive given that there were only 5 teams, but we crushed a team with players around the same levels, and beat a team we had absolutely no right to even get a game from"

Bitmin,@Max why is ur name closed room
Bitmin,I swear Max has the most cryptic custom status' of all time
Bitmin,its true dude
Bitmin,my statuses were just my name and numbers
Bitmin,"A closed room is a concept used in mystery fiction. An example would be a room with a corpse and the only key to that room in the pocket of the dead person, giving the impression that the crime was not possible to commit."
Bitmin,I've been reading mystery fiction for the last few months and closed rooms have come up a lot.
Bitmin,I'm gonna bother you to play danganronpa again
Bitmin,I'll get to it later
Bitmin,Does Danganronpa have closed rooms?
Bitmin,occasionally
Bitmin,wtf spoilers
Bitmin,there is so much murder per game
Bitmin,you can't dodge closed rooms
Bitmin,stfu i was planning on playing them soon
Bitmin,ruining everything
Bitmin,look my dude
Bitmin,STFU
Bitmin,saying there's a lot of murder in danganronpa is like saying there's a lot of cowboys in red dead redemption
Bitmin,it's literally the premise
Bitmin,LOL
Bitmin,you're reminding me i need to play it too
Bitmin,wonder if i can pirate it somehow 
Bitmin,I can literally send you the rom
Bitmin,right now

Bitmin,i feel bad pirating games tho
Bitmin,i should just buy it
Bitmin,aight here's what I'd say
Bitmin,if you're not sure if you're gonna like it
Bitmin,"pirate it, play the first two trials then make up your mind"
Bitmin,"and then you can decide to stop, or buy it, or do what I did and finish the first game but buy the other two"
Bitmin,oh thats a good idea

Bitmin,how is that better
Bitmin,elaborate
Bitmin,the only two important channels should be next to eachother
Bitmin,it's not about importance it looks better holistically because you go from the least amount of characters to the greatest amount of characters
Bitmin,quotes - 6 characters
Bitmin,memes - 5 characters
Bitmin,memes > quotes
Bitmin,
Bitmin,no but the physical pixels that memes takes up is greater then quotes
Bitmin,because of the m

Bitmin,I've got an Oculus Rift. It definitely is fun to play on sometimes but there seems to be a lack of really good VR games.

Fusion use this so you can master devon speak"
Bitmin,ez 
Bitmin,Why did you use x and y?
Bitmin,because I wasnt steep in convention when I wrote this
Bitmin,I didnt know that i was the standard iterator variable
Bitmin,No

Bitmin,"Weeb: Enhanced sense of ""culture"" often takes things with satire and loves to shittalk.
Otaku: Owns various amounts of merchandise and can be very loyal to one or more of his waifus
One person can be both a weeb and otaku but there is a diffrence between a real otaku and a fake one"
Bitmin,@Zain
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"yeah except that literally no one cares and we all just call ourselves and each other ""weebs"""
Bitmin,also those aren't even the true definitions but go off ig
Bitmin,they arn't deffinitions
Bitmin,just my way of interoperting the differance
Bitmin,where did you even get that from???
Bitmin,i've never heard it described like that in my life
Bitmin,"weebs tend to be more of an ""american style"" shitpost version of otaku"
Bitmin,meanwhile otakus originate from the mainland itself
Bitmin,and dont really have that satire
Bitmin,?????
Bitmin,bruh
Bitmin,i ain't heard the word otaku in YEARS
Bitmin,idk where you're getting your info from
Bitmin,Gigguk
Bitmin,he said that?
Bitmin,weeb and otaku are interchangeable words
Bitmin,but there is a diffrence in which one is called
Bitmin,and percived
Bitmin,"that's why i said ""but there is a diffrence between a real otaku and a fake one"""
Bitmin,??????
Bitmin,i think you're a fake otaku and weeb

Bitmin,"Enjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube."
Bitmin,wtf is this shit
Bitmin,
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,saying youre an otaku is tbh more cringe than saying you're a weeb
Bitmin,cause atleast you arent in denail if you admit to being a weeb
Bitmin,there's a real dictionary deffiniton of otaku and not weeb
Bitmin,Well i just tried to kill myself
Bitmin,i'm genuinely unsure if you guys know the difference.
Bitmin,if you use a non english term to describe how much of an anime fan you are then you're a weeb
Bitmin,"weeb, ottaku who cards they both cringe"
Bitmin,you're all gay
Bitmin,problem solved
Bitmin,
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,so basically according to that video: Otakus don't exist in the west
Bitmin,checkmate
Bitmin,the weeb vs weeaboo thing seems to be true
Bitmin,"basically otaku is just a cringe-y, outdated term that people in the west don't really say anymore"
Bitmin,literally no one cares
Bitmin,im just saying rainbowpixel is wrONG
Bitmin,and im the more cultured weeb here
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Seems to fit
Bitmin,no ?
Bitmin,I mean what you just said now
Bitmin,compare your message with his definition
Bitmin,i never defined weeb
Bitmin,"all it means is someone who likes anime, that's literally it"
Bitmin,"""I'm the more cultured weeb here"" is what I was referring to"
Bitmin,don't you guys live in the same house?

Bitmin,"I will hopefully be able to do that as well. Its doubtful that I'll have the time though, since I will be taking calc 2 when it comes out. My math professors have said to not expect much free time when taking calc 2."
Bitmin,I've looked over some of the stuff for integration
Bitmin,It seems conceptually easier than differential
Bitmin,That is so wrong
Bitmin,"But the ""shutup and calculate"" bits seem hard"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Taking derivatives is pretty easy once you understand all the rules
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,Is my second comment correct?
Bitmin,I mean
Bitmin,It's just plug and chug really
Bitmin,But the equations can get complicated
Bitmin,so you have to be careful
Bitmin,What do you mean by shutup and calculate?
Bitmin,Definite integrals
Bitmin,You mean using the fundamental theorem?
Bitmin,I don't think so
Bitmin,Definite integrals are the ones where you have limits of integration right?
Bitmin,Definite integrals have a defined boundary
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,Shutup and calculate is just another way of saying plug and chug
Bitmin,When you have found the antiderivative of a given function
Bitmin,and you want to calculate with the given boundary
Bitmin,To solve those what I've been doing is integrating and then plugging the 2 limits into the new equation and subtracting one from the other.
Bitmin,"It comes from physics land where students get to philosophical about what equations mean so the teachers shout ""SHUTUP AND CALCULATE!"""
Bitmin,@Max is your school trimesters or semesters?
Bitmin,semesters
Bitmin,Ahh
Bitmin,That's why you covered integration in calc 1
Bitmin,We have 3 calc courses 
Bitmin,So should Max
Bitmin,I mean my school does have calc 3
Bitmin,but I don't need to take it
Bitmin,Calc 3 is multivariable calculus
Bitmin,Chemistry majors only need up to calc 2
Bitmin,TBH now I'm confused and am not sure which calculi are available at my uni 
Bitmin,you should have calc 1-3

Bitmin,"Airheads God Tier, KitKat God tier, Reese dropped to very solid, Candy Cigarette dropped to suck"
Bitmin,How the fuck are airheads god tier
Bitmin,Airheads actually a tier above god tier
Bitmin,Not just saying this to fuck with you guys
Bitmin,This tier list is garbage
Bitmin,Airheads are #1 candy
Bitmin,Puts hot tamales in the pixie sticks tier this doesn’t even make any sense
Bitmin,They suck just as much as pixie sticks
Bitmin,I can understand why you disagree that it’s god tier but I’m genuinely baffled why airheads is rated as a low tier candy
Bitmin,LAFFY TAFFY IS GOOD
Bitmin,Unless you’re ranking it low cause like “oh it’s sticky if you hold it”
Bitmin,WAY BETTER THAN AIRHEADS
Bitmin,SMH
Bitmin,Airheads taste good
Bitmin,they aight
Bitmin,this is the worst tiers list of all time
Bitmin,Clearly the people who made this tier list had no hard candy proponents on their board of directors
Bitmin,How biased
Bitmin,How discriminatory
Bitmin,how are dots and health very solid ???
Bitmin,calling HR
Bitmin,those are both pretty nasty
Bitmin,There wasn't much hard candy here anyways
Bitmin,Also laffy taffy and airheads suck
Bitmin,settle this like civilized men and women
Bitmin,fight to the death
Bitmin,You have to put way too much effort into eating them for very little payoff
Bitmin,LAFFY TAFFY TASTES SUPER GOOD WYM
Bitmin,and theyre not hard to eat at all
Bitmin,im boutta throw hands
Bitmin,Throw them
Bitmin,also fun dip is great dont @ me

Bitmin,No
Bitmin,they just sugar
Bitmin,if i wanna eat sugar
Bitmin,i would just eat sugar
Bitmin,They solid at lowest

Bitmin,“””technically””” in the best (worst?) case where all seats are filled everyone else also only gets one armrest since you ain’t putting ur arm on someone else’s
Bitmin,otherwise you get below average armrests
Bitmin,oh snap it's elvin
Bitmin,just sit in one of hte center seats if you want two armrests so bad
Bitmin,the god
Bitmin,alvin
Bitmin,my favourite chipmunk
Bitmin,dab
Bitmin,also @Eric Working From Home ur candy tier list is high key awful
Bitmin,"your argument that ""its just sugar so why wouldnt i jsut eat sugar"" is the dumbest thing ive ever heard"
Bitmin,okay that was a joke
Bitmin,but actually
Bitmin,pixie sticks
Bitmin,are just sugar in a paper tube
Bitmin,crutches at school is not the move
Bitmin,there is no appeal to that whatsoever
Bitmin,also what jed said that too
Bitmin,thats why they C tier
Bitmin,"pixie sticks have no flavor, they are messy, and they make you want to die after eating them"
Bitmin,you put reese way too high
Bitmin,ok they arent messy
Bitmin,if you make a mess with them you're big dubm
Bitmin,reeses are clearly the best candy
Bitmin,what if you wanted to die before eating them
Bitmin,You literally can't eat them
Bitmin,If they get any moisture in them whatsoever
Bitmin,im convinced you two are disabled
Bitmin,It's game over
Bitmin,^
Bitmin,dont spit into the tube then??????
Bitmin,???
Bitmin,You have to put the tube to your mouth to eat it
Bitmin,you guys are also way too hung up on the pixie sticks i put them into C tier you monkeys
Bitmin,It's inevitable
Bitmin,oml how do you function
Bitmin,you turn the tube over nd pour it onto ur tongue
Bitmin,"Plus, even if you do get anything out of them"
Bitmin,like you dont suck the shit outta a tube
Bitmin,They don't even taste good
Bitmin,the only candy that i would consider being worse than pixie sticks is hot tamales
Bitmin,i put them C tier i dont know why you're so hung up on them
Bitmin,its not like i put them in A tier
Bitmin,In
Bitmin,What
Bitmin,World
Bitmin,Are they better than
Bitmin,Resses pieces
Bitmin,??????????????????
Bitmin,"hot tomales are like someone took mike and ikes and went ""yea these are incredibly disappointing, but i think we could make them worse"""
Bitmin,cause reeses pieces are big 
Bitmin,its like skittles meets the bad part of reeses
Bitmin,Ok
Bitmin,I just saw that you put York peppermint patties below them
Bitmin,Your opinion on candy is so bad
Bitmin,the fact that the bottom tier contained spicy candy is the only thing that saved yorks from bottom tier
Bitmin,yorks are actually
Bitmin,so
Bitmin,fucking
Bitmin,bad
Bitmin,you know what
Bitmin,i'd put them on the same level of hot tamales
Bitmin,york peppermint patties are the most vile disgusting shit in hte world
Bitmin,like peppermint marshmallow
Bitmin,what the fuck
Bitmin,youn know what fuck hot tamales im putting york patties in hte bottom tier
Bitmin,Looking more into your tier list
Bitmin,"bruh i dunno how i can trust anyone's opinion who puts CRUNCH above REECES, TWIX, HEATH, and SNICKERS"
Bitmin,You have fundip above twix
Bitmin,And twizzlers
Bitmin,that might be the worst take in this whole list
Bitmin,"hot take, twix bigly not good"
Bitmin,twix kinda meh
Bitmin,crunch is the worst chocolate bar free
Bitmin,Also
Bitmin,Skittles below fundip
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,What planet are you on?
Bitmin,twix is a crunchy flavourless cookie pretending to be a chocolate bar by adding in infinitesimal amounts fo chocolate and caramel
Bitmin,crunch is good
Bitmin,idk whats wrong with you
Bitmin,crunch is the kinda chocolate bar that you eat when you have given up on enjoying chocolate bars
Bitmin,chris the kinda guy with such shit taste in candy he puts this stuff in S tier
Bitmin,crunch is literally just a milk chocolate bar with crunchy pieces
Bitmin,idk what you find wrong with it
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,you guys also thuroughly did not give milk duds enough credit
Bitmin,like unless you're lowering its rank cause its like cement for your teeth
Bitmin,cause if you your list loses all credit then
Bitmin,that is exactly why we put it lower
Bitmin,you guys are goons
Bitmin,also it snowing outside widepeepohappy
Bitmin,we're not ranking how fucking ergonomic the candy is
Bitmin,that is part of the consumption pprocess
Bitmin,we ranking how good it tastes
Bitmin,you moron
Bitmin,you fool
Bitmin,yall are some fucking reeses shills might I add
Bitmin,when trick or treating I wouldn't even trade my reeses pieces for anything I'd literally give that shit away
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,i should've known Chris' Cnady tier list would be shit cause of that time when he asked what candy i wanted i said gummies and this MF got Sour Cola Bottle Gummies
Bitmin,not even normal ones
Bitmin,fucking
Bitmin,sour
Bitmin,cola
Bitmin,bottle
Bitmin,gummies
Bitmin,kameron is it actually snowing
Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,yea it is actually snowing

Bitmin,@Matt  i got 11 lights
Bitmin,9 regular and lux
Bitmin,Just got back from a reddit event at the board game café. It was pretty fun. 
Bitmin,what does that mean
Bitmin,It means people in the Houston board games subreddit said that there would be a lot of people there that day and they invited others to come join them. The store even gave a discount if you mentioned the subreddit.
Bitmin,nice
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I will be distancing myself from the other Zacks after discovering what shit taste they have
Bitmin,Literally
Bitmin,cereal
Bitmin,
Bitmin,This cereal tier list is pretty good
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,Much better than the candy one
Bitmin,we made it with group think
Bitmin,that's why kamerons bad opinions didn't make it to light
Bitmin,
Bitmin,fuuuuck the internet historian just released an hour long video
Bitmin,but I need to write an essy
Bitmin,oops
Bitmin,N O M A N S S K Y
Bitmin,whatabouttit
Bitmin,Internet historians video is about that
Bitmin,"Corn flakes isnt an ""organic"" ceral tf?"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,well it is tasteless
Bitmin,"Also the ""organic"" tier was a meme"
Bitmin,ah like my meatloaf ingredient tier
Bitmin,but also i heard feeding people grape nuts is banned by hte geneva convention
Bitmin,"and @Rotomotorz corn flakes are tasteless to stop masturbation, its by design"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,god yall so uneducated
Bitmin,"It might just be that your distaste for corn flakes is not by accident though, as Mr Kellogg actually developed cornflakes primarily to stop children from masturbating!  He had particular ideas about masturbation, writing, “if illicit commerce of the sexes is a heinous sin, self-pollution is a crime doubly abominable.” He felt that certain foods inspired ‘self-pollution’, like spicy foods,  meat, and generally anything that tasted too good. One of the biggest fights he had with his brother, and business partner, was over adding sugar to cornflakes. Kellogg’s brother had the (right) idea that sugar would vastly improve the taste of the cereal, but Kellogg stood by his original vision, that of plain and boring, sexual desire killing food, so the flakes remained unsweetened."
Bitmin,also hot take
Bitmin,french topast crunch
Bitmin,not that good
Bitmin,That's the hottest take
Bitmin,Because it is so wrong
Bitmin,undeniably worse that cinnamon toast crunch at the very least
Bitmin,atleast the latter has flavour
Bitmin,wait this corn flake story is hilarious
Bitmin,kellogg is actually stupid
Bitmin,well he became very rich and thne very dead
Bitmin,@Eric Working From Home your list is bad
Bitmin,My list may be bad but I stand by French toast crunch being at most B tier material
Bitmin,gamers
Bitmin,non-gamers
Bitmin,D:
Bitmin,daheck the iceborn monster hunter dlc is $40
Bitmin,It's a whole new storyline with a bunch of new monsters and more
Bitmin,New area aswell
Bitmin,so like
Bitmin,1/5th of a game
Bitmin,theres like 12 new monsters
Bitmin,31 total
Bitmin,so like 2/5th of a game
Bitmin,get it right
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Joined the server.
Bitmin,yo i told you guys french toast cruch was top teir
Bitmin,it really aint tho
Bitmin,"cheap, tasty, affordable for a broke student living by the paycheck ."
Bitmin,
Bitmin,the community consistently ranks it B-C tier
Bitmin,lucky charms is too sweet.
Bitmin,it is cheap and affordable
Bitmin,honey nuts is s
Bitmin,but it is flavourless
Bitmin,It's literally not flavourless though
Bitmin,Like what
Bitmin,naw. you can taste the honey
Bitmin,that's what makes it good
Bitmin,Do you have a tounge?
Bitmin,must've had a bad box at your place then during meetup
Bitmin,also life is really good too
Bitmin,cause it was like flavourless cardboard cubes
Bitmin,frosted flakes is also way too sweet
Bitmin,nah forsted flakes S tier
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,cheerios is tasteless
Bitmin,you're saying everything is too sweet
Bitmin,i think maybe you just like mild flavours
Bitmin,either tasteless or too sweet
Bitmin,maybe thast why you like french toast crunch
Bitmin,bruh. i never said frootloops was too sweet
Bitmin,frootloops is S
Bitmin,that we can agree on
Bitmin,high A
Bitmin,jsut cause hte basis for S tier is frosted flakes
Bitmin,if we put frootloops in S we gotta make a new tier above S
Bitmin,frosted flakes becomes so spongey after like 30 seconds
Bitmin,yeah thats the best way to eat cereal
Bitmin,leave it in hte milk for like 1 minute so its no longer crunchy
Bitmin,thats my second hot take of the day
Bitmin,no
Bitmin,This is why we ignore your opinions
Bitmin,no. crunchy cereal with the slight taste of milk is the best
Bitmin,so you're rather have mini wheats like right as you put the milk in when the inside is still fully dry
Bitmin,we fuck mini wheats
Bitmin,rather than let the milk permeate it
Bitmin,kuz it's disgusting
Bitmin,this fucker eats his mini wheats dry
Bitmin,
Bitmin,mini wheats is disgusting
Bitmin,wtfd
Bitmin,benson your taste in cereal is so shit
Bitmin,at least i have a tongue kuz i can actually taste the honey in the honey nut
Bitmin,im aware theres honey in honey nut
Bitmin,i jsut still do not enjoy it
Bitmin,also. more people here prefer crunchy cereal here.
Bitmin,im no longer on hte milky vs Dry cereal debate
Bitmin,mini wheats are good
Bitmin,they sweetness doesn't go well with the milk. if you're unfortunate enough to have 3% it tastes even worse. at that point you're eating cream with laxities.
Bitmin,im like 90% sure your tastebuds jsut finna dont work
Bitmin,you out here saying everyhitng too sweet
Bitmin,if it has even a semblance of flavour
Bitmin,i'm probably more sensitive to sweetness than you are. also not everything is too sweet. plus i never said mini wheats was too sweet.
Bitmin,
Bitmin,ok maybe that i coulda worded that better
Bitmin,mini wheats tastes like frosting. which doesnt go well with milk. it's like mixing mint and chocolate
Bitmin,bruh
Bitmin,you ever heard of mint chocolate chip
Bitmin,or andes mints
Bitmin,i have. but mint seems to ruin chocolate for me
Bitmin,I think your taste buds are broke
Bitmin,this guys taste buds def broke as hell
Bitmin,does cilantro taste slightly like mint to anyone here?
Bitmin,shit tastes like soap
Bitmin,soap* i meant soap
Bitmin,link the teirlist website
Bitmin,for cereal
Bitmin,nvm found it
Bitmin,
Bitmin,lucky charms i used to like.
Bitmin,but i cant eat it anymore.
Bitmin,krave is probably my favourite
Bitmin,and if the nesquick cereal was here it'd go in A teir
Bitmin,wrong
Bitmin,so wrong
Bitmin,i really like my milk.
Bitmin,if i'm gunna eat frosted flakes i'm gunna dump my milk with my unsweetend dark roast coffee
Bitmin,"bruh honey nut cheerios definitely ""ruins the milk"""
Bitmin,i see your point. but it's not as bad as frosted flakes
Bitmin,benson you put raisin bran over corn flakes
Bitmin,you opinion literally has negative validity
Bitmin,Devon you don't get to speak
Bitmin,actually shut up chris your shit taste extends beyond cereals
Bitmin,atleast benson kept his terrible taste localized to cereal

Bitmin,How's the novel coming along
Bitmin,"@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home Just played another game of Agricola, this time with the revised version (the one we played was the original), and thought you might want to hear my thoughts. 
1. The revised version is definitely an improvement upon the original. Everyone at the table had useful cards to play and some decent synergies; card quality just felt higher overall.
2. I think revised version + draft would be even better, as to allow for even better card synergies.
3. Restocking the spaces in the physical version is way less tedious than in TTS (not much we can do about that though).
4. Having a plan for food and getting it setup before the first harvest is VERY important, as having to waste actions on food later is painful when better action cards flip.
5. Overly focusing on one thing is bad. One player went totally in on the farming strategy and ended the game with 11 grain and 7 vegetables (max scoring is at 8 grain and 4 vegetables). While this is impressive, all the excess crops didn't help in the score department and this player didn't win.
6. I overall had a lot of fun and think we shouldn't give up on this game if we can find a way to use the revised edition cards."

Bitmin,"and from talking to people who know more about the current guilty gear and more from people who've played the demo of the new one, it's still looking like a solid game, just not really in the same vein as the previous ones (apparently this one is just gonna be ""better street fighter"" if it continues in its current state)"

Bitmin,you have no money
Bitmin,when you got locked in the store someone took your wallet aswell
Bitmin,then whats he doing there

Bitmin,They would settle it with me. They would have serious bad press to worry about if they locked me in. They would probably pay me to keep my mouth shut and not care if I munched a few chips to keep myself alive.

The different titles allow those outside to know the status of those people and whether they should expect them to return.

Bitmin,if game studios try to innovate on old formulas this is bad
Bitmin,we must stick to the old ways
Bitmin,yea
Bitmin,boomer moment
Bitmin,list
Bitmin,@Ultimate if anyone wanna play at some point today lmk

Bitmin,Why is your name 16th at Genesis?
Bitmin,https://gyazo.com/ef0af6f29dc44b7d254db4d687d6892b
Bitmin,Gyazo
Bitmin,cause I am gonna get 16th at genesis
Bitmin,
Bitmin,This might be the most satisfying math problem I've ever completed.
Bitmin,I now understand why this formula exists rather than just accepting it because I was told it works.
Bitmin,wgat a nerd
Bitmin,school is gay
Bitmin,im getting good at ultimate
Bitmin,also the kameron works in ultimate too
Bitmin,back air into dropzone fair is nasty on link
Bitmin,"i just improve crazy fast, gimme a year and ill be top 10 mdva"
Bitmin,I wish I enjoyed ultimate as much as you do. I just never found a character that I enjoy playing enough to get super into it. Good luck on your road to mdva top 10!
Bitmin,you should keep playing max!
Bitmin,just dont play palu she lame and dumb
Bitmin,But she's so good
Bitmin,"Ike is too one dimensional, Bowser is pretty matchup dependent, and Toon Link isn't good enough."
Bitmin,Maybe I could give Pikachu another try.
Bitmin,just play ike he not bad
Bitmin,He was the character I kept coming back to
Bitmin,maybe
Bitmin,Ike + Bowser would be a fun duo
Bitmin,hey i like both of those characters
Bitmin,"Is that a ""back off"" type of message?"
Bitmin,no it was an encouraging message
Bitmin,as in
Bitmin,i can help you play both of those characters
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,hey Pikachu is mine >:(((
Bitmin,I'll sue you
Bitmin,I could also try G&W
Bitmin,I'm surprised I haven't yet
Bitmin,He's one of my favorites in PM
Bitmin,G&W???
Bitmin,am i stupid? Who is that
Bitmin,Game and Watch
Bitmin,oh
Bitmin,Oakland is a really shitty city
Bitmin,First impression
Bitmin,Genesis boy pog
Bitmin,How was the flight?
Bitmin,I was gonna have nothing to do all morning but one of my friends was on my flight so we played friendlies for a few hours
Bitmin,Nice
Bitmin,It was super short it kinda felt like I didn't go anywhere
Bitmin,It was like an hour and a half
Bitmin,Yea that's not too long
Bitmin,It would've taken like 10 hours to drive tho
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,Short flights always feel weird cause the check-in and waiting for the plane always takes longer than the flight itself
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,We had a bunch of smash players I know on the flight
Bitmin,Fat Goku sat like 2 seats away from me
Bitmin,That's sick
Bitmin,Who did you play friendlies with
Bitmin,Also I'm mega bored just waiting for my ENT
Bitmin,Just sitting in a room
Bitmin,My boy culex
Bitmin,"grqwae,mewes"
Bitmin,games*
Bitmin,Did you have a fucking stroke there buddy?
Bitmin,was laying on the floor and reached up to try and type games
Bitmin,i heard oakland is kinda ghetto
Bitmin,Just found a steaming shit at work
Bitmin,On the floor
Bitmin,
Bitmin,??
Bitmin,What the fuck
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I am never using one of the restrooms by the foundry ever again
Bitmin,These people are ANIMALS
Bitmin,Bruh who does that in the space x IBM apple Lockheed Martin Uber office headquarters
Bitmin,You forgot Google aswell
Bitmin,No I didn't
Bitmin,i cant believe berkshire hathaway would hire someone who does that
Bitmin,also yes Oakland is pretty ghetto be careful
Bitmin,it's like 90% very sketchy and after the first time I went there I decided it'd be the bright move to just uber both in and out
Bitmin,also like two people were murdered there in the four months I was nearby
Bitmin,Yeah I'm not planning on being anywhere other than the bnb and venue after today
Bitmin,You forgot Amazon and Netflix
Bitmin,i heard there was a round 1 near there
Bitmin,@Jed when you game?
Bitmin,or maybe im thinking of sns
Bitmin,Already witnessed a fight ao
Bitmin,ears clears
Bitmin,Friday at 8pm
Bitmin,"n0ne and moky ended up being ranked right next to each other on the top 100 rankings this year, 15th for n0ne and 14th for moky"
Bitmin,I think this is the highest toronto has been since way back when KK was top 10

Bitmin,did someone say furry owo
Bitmin,Did someone say furry 
Bitmin,
Bitmin,The Aussie player I'm seeded to play is fucking good
Bitmin,But he's in my bnb and I'm getting the download
Bitmin,stream it
Bitmin,"Just played some more agricola, this time with the school board game club. Really enjoying the game."
Bitmin,board game club 
Bitmin,More like
Bitmin,Board game club 
Bitmin,Lmao my sponsor really out here dropping me the morning of genesis
Bitmin,Oof
Bitmin,Place higher than 16th and show them who they shouldnt have dropped
Bitmin,It's only cause I called him out about getting the money he said I'd get in October
Bitmin,Hmm that sounds illegal on their part
Bitmin,I mean he said that atk doesn't deserve me and doesn't think I'm a good fit
Bitmin,Do you have email/message chains?
Bitmin,Well he sent me the money today
Bitmin,Aight that's not too bad then
Bitmin,But it still might be worth going public with provided that's not a breach of contract
Bitmin,"Yeah just kind of stupid that he'd just drop me with no discussion, I've literally been with the org for over a year now and joined at it's conception"
Bitmin,So here's the funny thing
Bitmin,"""They didn't pay me and when I gave them shit about it they fired me for 'not being a good fit'"" is kind of a huge red flag"
Bitmin,I never signed a contract so I can say whatever I want
Bitmin,"Like, wanting money from your sponsor is kinda how sponsors work"
Bitmin,I'd say don't go overboard but it's an important cautionary tale
Bitmin,Yeah I'm probably gonna tweet and just say that I've been let go and the circumstances behind it
Bitmin,Yaw
Bitmin,"Be honest, don't be overly vicious (don't want to alienate potential future sponsors), but also make it clear that there appears to be a correlation between wanting to be paid and not being a good fit"
Bitmin,Yeah
Bitmin,F. Sorry to hear that Jed
Bitmin,"It's okay, I was kind of thinking about it anyways cause I was getting really frustrated"
Bitmin,It took bemmie almost 5 months to get me the money
Bitmin,And I would ask kindly once a month
Bitmin,Until last month u started to show I was getting upset
Bitmin,Cause he keeps running all these tournaments with thousands of dollars on the line
Bitmin,How much money did you get anyways?
Bitmin,150 for one event
Bitmin,Which is better than what most rivals sponsorships do
Bitmin,also do they handle travel fees and stuff?
Bitmin,So it was a hella good deal and that's why I wanted to stay
Bitmin,They way that they did it was they reimbursed half my flight
Bitmin,But I had to buy the ticket and send them the reciept
Bitmin,are they still gonna reimburse your genesis travel?
Bitmin,I highly doubt it
Bitmin,We barely discussed it
Bitmin,"I said ""I assume genesis reimbursement is out of the question as I still haven't gotten the reimbursement from heatwave"""
Bitmin,yikes
Bitmin,That's a big F
Bitmin,"although now he has an excuse to be like ""yup not paying for genesis"""
Bitmin,"also that's probably something worth mentioning in your post ""so I flew out to genesis while still on the team and they're not gonna be paying my flight"""
Bitmin,Yeah I'm gonna write it up after I've thought about it
Bitmin,One of my now ex teammates is at genesis and I'm gonna try and find him
Bitmin,Not sure if this is real homies but stay safe

Bitmin,I just saw an article by a veteran Terraforming Mars player that said building cities is one of the worst strategies in the game. I'm not sure how that could be given that my city spam in the second game we played seemed so effective.
Bitmin,I guess we never really understood how to play the game at all
Bitmin,Someday I'll probably try it again
Bitmin,"Now that I'm thinking about it more, I feel like I actually probably liked the game, but that feeling was overshadowed by the rather negative table atmosphere and how much everyone else seemed to be miserable."
Bitmin,"Logically, it has two of my favorite things in a game, drafting and engine building, so I should probably like it."
Bitmin,"I think that if I could be shown/show myself with more plays that the game has more viable strategies than city spam like that article claims, I could probably have fun playing the game."

Bitmin,hbox has really bad di
Bitmin,also marth puff on dreamland looks practically impossible
Bitmin,even tho zain is winning
Bitmin,he is just way better
Bitmin,Hbox is carried by puff
Bitmin,I feel like he's just gotten really complacent
Bitmin,he dragged puff up for years
Bitmin,but now that he's on top he's getting lazy
Bitmin,I would say he actually used to be carried by puff even more than now. See his skill with other characters over time as evidence.
Bitmin,his secondaries have always kinda sucked?
Bitmin,They are way better now
Bitmin,but in general I'd say he is the reason he's carried by puff
Bitmin,"not only is dreamland busted for puff, but it also kills the momentum of the other player"
Bitmin,like he made puff into a character who can carry
Bitmin,and then stopped pushing her as a character
Bitmin,and now he's letting his past work carry him
Bitmin,and now everyone's figuring out how to counter that
Bitmin,bro he literally never used the sing punish on marth until like last year
Bitmin,thats how little he innovates
Bitmin,"wow, one (1) new piece of tech"
Bitmin,naw it was evidence for your point moron
Bitmin,yeah I was agreeing
Bitmin,he stopped innovating after like 2017
Bitmin,hbox is honestly so lame
Bitmin,I would say that at that point in time he was carrying puff but now he's just letting puff carry him
Bitmin,the worst guy to be the best melee player
Bitmin,never plays friendlies
Bitmin,at least people are figuring him out
Bitmin,doesnt innovate or play to the meta
Bitmin,camps when he is losing
Bitmin,like I think unless he starts working hard again he's not holding onto #1 for another year
Bitmin,think about how unstoppable he looked in early 2019
Bitmin,and now he's got a whole bunch of frequent losses
Bitmin,look how much data he gets by playing games on dreamland
Bitmin,"zain, wizzy for a bit, hbox sometimes, especially leffen"
Bitmin,i dunno if winning a game on dreamland vs hbox is even a good idea
Bitmin,"Go Zain, saving melee"
Bitmin,"and he's got hax, leffen, fiction all chilling down there"
Bitmin,it'd be fairly insane if he even makes grands
Bitmin,dammit I want to make dinner but there's like no sets I don't want to watch
Bitmin,I guess I'll wait for hbox fiction
Bitmin,fuck which set is next
Bitmin,can I just leave during the ad break?
Bitmin,but it's probably gonna be leffen hax
Bitmin,smash gg says that leffen hax is next
Bitmin,darn
Bitmin,HAX$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Bitmin,tweet incoming 
Bitmin,THE ROOM WAS COLD
Bitmin,idk if the box should be leagl. in my opinion the set should be replayed?

5th ain't too bad to start my comeback off with I guess. We'll take it all things considered!"
Bitmin,SPAM  THIS  CRUSTACEAN  FOR  HBOX  ELIMINATION

Bitmin,"Beating the World’s Best at Super Smash Bros. Melee with Deep Reinforcement
Learning"
Bitmin,@solarlight
Bitmin,Andrew what is this?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Can you read?
Bitmin,"One particularly clever player found that the simple strategy of crouching at the edge of the stage caused the network to behave very oddly, refusing to attack and eventually KOing itself by falling off the other side of the stage. One hypothesis to explain this weakness is the lack of diversity in training - since the network only played against old copies of itself, it never encountered such a degenerate strategy"
Bitmin,absolutely large brain
Bitmin,RIGHT
Bitmin,Its a cool paper
Bitmin,They actually released their training lab on github
Bitmin,Gonna see if I can improve thigns 
Bitmin,@Max

Bitmin,yes
Bitmin,yeah mute bitches can't so no
Bitmin,What
Bitmin,?
Bitmin,so
Bitmin,fuck essays
Bitmin,True
Bitmin,Settle a debate https://www.strawpoll.me/19347040
Bitmin,THe is our high five phrase
Bitmin,"Vote Now! [Up high, down low fakes out high five too slow] [Up high, down low, in the middle fakes out high five too slow]"
Bitmin,It’s supposed to say the fake out not “the is our” autocorrect
Bitmin,Yo wait
Bitmin,who the fuck out here saying in the middle
Bitmin,Cause Ashley says you don’t say in the middle but I’m saying you gotta day in the middle so that you have proper rhyming sequence
Bitmin,Literally never met anybody why doesn’t do in the middle
Bitmin,Tf
Bitmin,Wait
Bitmin,Also Chris don’t vote I want to know what the general populace does and you have time and time again shown you don’t do a single normal thing
Bitmin,How does saying in the middle make it a rhyming sequence
Bitmin,It literally doesn't rhyme
Bitmin,"Cause it it goes 
Up high (not rhyming line)
Down low (setup for the rhyme)
In the middle (additional line to keep the rhymes on alternating lines)
Too slow (Rhyme Payoff)"
Bitmin,If you lead a single not rhyming line into two back to back rhyming lines it messes with the flow
Bitmin,I guess that makes sense
Bitmin,Listen to any song
Bitmin,Okay
Bitmin,I feel like your thing works better in text
Bitmin,I feel like it works better in practice aswell
Bitmin,Nah
Bitmin,Cause the rhyme part is tacked onto the middle line
Bitmin,So it doesn't feel like payoff for the down low line
Bitmin,you feel
Bitmin,The only additional payoff of not adding in the middle is that if you fake out the low high five it leaves their hand lingering in a downward instead of horizontal motion
Bitmin,You don’t need lay-off on every like
Bitmin,Payoff*
Bitmin,Line*
Bitmin,"Like example
Life is old there (spacing)
Older than the trees (setup)
Younger than the mountains (spacing)
Blowing like a breeze (payoff)"
Bitmin,There no payoff on the mountains line cause it’s added as spacing
Bitmin,I think the clear distinction here is that your example is a song while the high five action is not
Bitmin,bruh who be saying in the middle
Bitmin,You're trying to turn it into a song
Bitmin,probably dumb people
Bitmin,But it doesn't need to be
Bitmin,It’s not a song it’s a rhyme sequence though
Bitmin,Genuinely never met people who didn’t say in the middle until now tf
Bitmin,Well here's the thing with that
Bitmin,You mostly do this joke to kids
Bitmin,So your family probably played it on you using the middle version
Bitmin,You aren't exposed to how other people say it because the other people you are exposed to in your life probably realize that you are too old to fall for the joke
Bitmin,I feel like the desire for there to be patterns in the rhyming sequence is a natural thing not something you learn like why “tock tick” sounds worse than “tick tock” there’s an actual like psychological reason for that
Bitmin,Ergo you never meet anyone that would say it the other way
Bitmin,Idk about you bro but I still be pulling the fake out high fives to this day
Bitmin,That’s how we got onto this topic of discussion
Bitmin,in the middle breaks the rythymic sequence which imo sounds worse
Bitmin,though ive heard both
Bitmin,That just wrong tho
Bitmin,It doesn’t break the sequence the fuck?
Bitmin,I think it could be due to kids not picking up on the rhyme the way you propose it though
Bitmin,Not adding it breaks the sequence
Bitmin,It's more clear that the rhyme is intended when the middle portion is excluded
Bitmin,To kids at least
Bitmin,What dumbass kids are you dealing with
Bitmin,The fuck
Bitmin,"yeah ""up high"" ""down low"" and ""too slow"" are all two syllable"
Bitmin,If you play a kid country roads are they not gonna notice trees rhymes with breeze
Bitmin,"""in the middle"" is 4"
Bitmin,It’s the bridging line Greg
Bitmin,Cause I was doing it to Ashley and when I said “down low” she slapped my hand with the might of a thousand suns then was like “why didn’t you try and pull your hand away” and I was like cause I pull it away in the middle and that’s how we got here
Bitmin,That line is from way back I just had to keep deleting and refusing it cause Greg kept saying some@dumb shit that I had to respond to right away
Bitmin,Hence why it doesn’t make sense in the conversation
Bitmin,fwiw i’ve always heard it w/ “in the middle”
Bitmin,e
Bitmin,@Cs:go
Bitmin,I'll play in like 10 minutes

Bitmin,That was my original idea
Bitmin,It looks all scratched up though at the bottom so it looks like it was acutally a car
Bitmin,how tf did that other car even get onto your driveway tbh
Bitmin,like wtf were they doing
Bitmin,the funniest thing about it is that I dont have a normal driveway
Bitmin,like my car was pretty far from the road
Bitmin,Draw a diagram
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Wow
Bitmin,That was really fast
Bitmin,and detailed
Bitmin,You should be an artist
Bitmin,but real talk I was sideways up by the door
Bitmin,and even then the road is a good couple feet behind me
Bitmin,Damn sucks dude
Bitmin,"Okay, theory time"
Bitmin,Some guy needed to turn around
Bitmin,so he pulls into your driveway to do it
Bitmin,hits your car
Bitmin,Theory time over
Bitmin,nah apparently people heard the guy speeding down the road and slamming into my car
Bitmin,but no one did anything 
Bitmin,
Bitmin,Did any them get any information or something @SWIRL GIRL
Bitmin,idk
Bitmin,hope you get everything squared away buddy
Bitmin,@Cs:go game time

Bitmin,catch this
Bitmin,
Bitmin,guys i will play csgo
Bitmin,enemy gamers hit him too hard
Bitmin,Who here has played the Steam version of UNO?
Bitmin,I wasn't even aware that there was a steam version of UNO. I've played it on tabletop simulator though.
Bitmin,"I think it's only like... $5-10...?
I've seen a few YouTubers play it and it actually looks kind fun."
Bitmin,It's got special rules you can enable... And different game settings with special cards.
Bitmin,"For example, 7s & 0s
Play a 7, you swap hands with someone
Play a 0, all hands rotate in the direction of the turn order."
Bitmin,Frostbite uno night @Tabletop
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,uno?
Bitmin,more like ew no
Bitmin,actually no
Bitmin,we gotta play the worlds number 2 card game
Bitmin,Dos

Bitmin,"aight monthly complete, did pretty aight:
1st in UNIST
2nd in Guilty Gear
7th in Melee
(also entered the free amateur bracket for ultimate and got 2nd)"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,19
Bitmin,jesus fuck what
Bitmin,I'm watching dbfz world tour finals
Bitmin,grand finals
Bitmin,go1 vs fenritti
Bitmin,"game one: go1 perfects fenritti
game two: fenritti perfects go1"
Bitmin,what the actual fuck
Bitmin,was it like 100-0 both games lol?
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,do you know how rare a single perfect is in dbfz?
Bitmin,insanely rare
Bitmin,I don't watch this game that often but I've literally never seen one until today
Bitmin,well i mean if you can 100-0 i cant imagine its that rare
Bitmin,"""If you can do it, it's not rare"""
Bitmin,a 100-0 is a guaranteed perfect
Bitmin,
Bitmin,you jsut gotta land hte first hit
Bitmin,you dingus
Bitmin,when i say 100-0 i mean you hit a guy when hes full health and fully kill him without dropping combo
Bitmin,"you can only 100-0 with sparking (which is a once-per-game thing, and also often used defensively) and hella bar"
Bitmin,and only on one of their three characters
Bitmin,most of the time it's 2-3 openings per character
Bitmin,so you pretty much need 5-9 straight openings to perfect someone
Bitmin,"depending on your team (damage-heavy vs neutral/mix-heavy vs balanced) and meter management (meter for damage vs meter for mixups, sparking for defense vs damage vs pressure)"
Bitmin,nerd
Bitmin,@Master Memers I have it on good authority that @The Rona is the suck dick man
Bitmin,https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/662012908284280853.gif?v=1
Bitmin,COCK
Bitmin,you're the suck cock man?
Bitmin,cheese is kinda insane at sm64
Bitmin,
Bitmin,oof
Bitmin,I got an A so I'm fine but I feel bad for the others
Bitmin,(this was a Gen Chem II test)
Bitmin,it might get curved
Bitmin,I've never seen a math/science test get curved
Bitmin,don't you curve by the highest grade tho
Bitmin,I remember one of my old housemates calling her parents about getting a 28% on a midterm but that was okay since the class average was 22%
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,damn
Bitmin,and that was engineering
Bitmin,but I guess it might depend on the school for what gets curved
Bitmin,"but still, odds are if it gets curved max's grade goes up"
Bitmin,I know my school curves business classes like accounting
Bitmin,"Also, my grade was 100 so it cannot go up"
Bitmin,ah well
Bitmin,This was supposedly the easiest test too
Bitmin,The class may shrink to a tiny size by the end of the semester if this trend continues
Bitmin,my guess is that those 6 people who failed are dragging the average down since most people seem to have done aight
Bitmin,they've probably given up on the course but haven't dropped yet
Bitmin,"meanwhile, in courses I wish I could drop, currently working on an assignment where this is one part of it:"
Bitmin,I have no idea what 'layout 2' is
Bitmin,this is the only use of the word 'layout' in the entire assignment
Bitmin,hmmm
Bitmin,so I've just decided to make my best guess at what they want here
Bitmin,"unfortunately, the whole assignment is like this"
Bitmin,so I'm making my best guess at like... half
Bitmin,this course is terrible but also mandatory
Bitmin,What course is this?
Bitmin,Software Requirements
Bitmin,it's all about how to plan software
Bitmin,"with the caveat that this is not, in any way, how anything works at any actual company"
Bitmin,sounds useless
Bitmin,it's a course about the pipe dream of how we wish people told us to make software
Bitmin,and the prof uses the word 'requirements' more than the word 'the'
Bitmin,it's 80% common sense and 20% buzzwords
Bitmin,I wish I still had classes where I could pass the tests on common sense alone
Bitmin,yes but also it's mind-numbingly boring and a shocking amount of work
Bitmin,I've been working on this assignment since like 2
Bitmin,ouch
Bitmin,most of that time has been consulting other people in the class and trying to put together a picture of wtf the prof wants us to do
Bitmin,Unclear instructions are the actual worst
Bitmin,You seem to get them a lot of the time
Bitmin,at this point we've all given up actually figuring anything out and we're just doing going with our best assumptions about what he wants
Bitmin,I hope he enjoys the eight pages of BS he's gonna be getting
Bitmin,also I hope that he stops doing the thing where whenever he posts the slides for a lecture it's all the slides for the whole course up until that point so you have to scroll through an increasingly long series of slides to reach the new stuff
Bitmin,"I may complain about my school a lot, but the one thing I will give it credit for is that the professors are of shockingly high quality on average."
Bitmin,mine are usually solid but there's generally one disaster per term
Bitmin,I've been told that's because my school attracts people who like the teaching part of being a prof rather than the research part.
Bitmin,"and yes, it's usually the researchers"
Bitmin,im zack's professor
Bitmin,Someone in my chem group chat just says he got a zero on the exam
Bitmin,i hate zack
Bitmin,I hope he read that one wrong
Bitmin,He did indeed
Bitmin,he actually got an A
Bitmin,the only test i've ever passed was a test on how to fail tests

Bitmin,join next game?
Bitmin,hahahaha my least favourite course from last term has come back to haunt me
Bitmin,GG
Bitmin,"there were group fuckups and I had to move to another group, they didn't change my group assignment in the system but said they'd match my final project's marks with the new group's"
Bitmin,that never fucking happened
Bitmin,final project was worth 30% of my grade
Bitmin,and with a zero on the system
Bitmin,I failed the course
Bitmin,thank god I have emails from the prof/TAs saying they'd do it
Bitmin,I've probably spent several hours over the last few weeks deliberating on what game to buy (board game) now that I have access to a place to play them weekly. I feel like my inability to choose is killing me but these games are just so expensive.
Bitmin,B U Y  T H E M
Bitmin,coward
Bitmin,
Bitmin,
Bitmin,"so quick question. Any of you guys know of a kind of sweet candy/chocolate that has cream in the middle? I know it sounds like a weird question, but I'm doing research.

and I want a serious answer......"
Bitmin,like a twinky?
Bitmin,"maybe, but not quite"
Bitmin,I mean I might know the thing you're thinking of but just not immediately connecting the dots
Bitmin,"I'm not sure if something like this exists.... but I'm thinking of something that's kind of like the length of a churro, but cream filled"
Bitmin,crunchy? soft?
Bitmin,
Bitmin,maybe more like crunchy?
Bitmin,these things?
Bitmin,yeah something like that
Bitmin,it would be better if they were like a type of candy though.... but I can make this work if nothing else
Bitmin,happy to kinda sorta help
Bitmin,
Bitmin,What is this for??
Bitmin,a valentines gift
Bitmin,
Bitmin,For someone?
Bitmin,"yeah, a co-worker"
Bitmin,Oooh :0
Bitmin,good luck!
Bitmin, love is in the air
Bitmin,huzzah ya boi is getting the runaround by campus faculty
Bitmin,still stuck waiting on that one prof to fix my grade so that I'm not failing
Bitmin,found out that half the systems show me failing another course but the other half show me passing it so I'm also waiting on a fix for that
Bitmin,found out that my credits from the summer school I took back in 2016 never got transferred so I'm short six credits (equivalent to one full-year course) to graduate unless I can get that fixed and no one seems quite sure how that process is gonna work so I keep getting passed off to new people
Bitmin,and now all the faculty offices are closed so instead of shlepping all around campus I have to send emails which are inevitably gonna get ignored for awhile
Bitmin,Damn that shit must be fucking infuriating hope you get it all sorted out
Bitmin,yeh
Bitmin,I've at least done all I can for today until people email me back
Bitmin,Zack boi where are you going to work?
Bitmin,Where do you WANT* to work?
Bitmin,fuckin anywhere at this point
Bitmin,but honestly in the here and now my focus is on making sure I can dodge all these weird administrative fuckups and actually graduate
Bitmin,"cause it'd be real awkward to get hired and be like ""surprise I gotta do one more term of school cause my credits ain't got transferred properly"""
Bitmin,Well just remember you don't have to be honest on your resume. You can put you have your degree then explain the situation
Bitmin,IF THEY FUCK UP
Bitmin,I might be wrong but I feel like resumes are just ice breakers
Bitmin,"And if you are honest but can't even get your foot in the door, you will never have a chance to prove yourself "
Bitmin,GOOD LUCK BUDDY
Bitmin,I would hire you 
Bitmin,Just finished my first calculus 2 test (was an online class so I could have procrastinated in to next Monday at the latest) . Now I can go play terra mystica again tomorrow guilt free 
Bitmin,"I miss lower level math where getting a reasonable answer was the norm if you did the problem correctly. Now, answers can look really messy and still be right."

Bitmin,I'm sitting in a very overpriced restaurant staring down this bottle of fiji water they leave at every table and presumably have to pay like $15 if you open

Bitmin,They're all super expensive
Bitmin,Or moderately expensive and serve tiny portions

Bitmin,So I'm willing to pay the five extra dollars for bigger better food
Bitmin,sounds like a plan
Bitmin,hbox legitimately looks unbeatable
Bitmin,he dominated 4 players who have historically gave him at least a bit of trouble
Bitmin,i dunno if fox beats puff tbh
Bitmin,not in b05 with sdi existing
Bitmin,I think fox is the best character against puff whether he wins or not
Bitmin,Puff is just overpowered. Puff gets to play brawl while everyone else plays melee.
Bitmin,amsa is sick
Bitmin,like he lost but he's sick

Bitmin,no m2k lol
Bitmin,wait there are like no top sheiks anymore
Bitmin,And then I said
Bitmin,Penis
Bitmin,yeah same
Bitmin,i think that if fox players win game 1 vs puff/marth they should just sd 4 times in the counterpick
Bitmin,like no meme
Bitmin,its more important to preserve momentum than to maybe win on the counterpick
Bitmin,I think people prone to tilting might do this but I don't think everyone should.
Bitmin,i do
Bitmin,at top level
Bitmin,its literally not worth the risk
Bitmin,fox never beats zain on fd
Bitmin,vs marth maybe I could see that everyone should
Bitmin,not vs puff though
Bitmin,even if you win dreamland
Bitmin,you have to play it again
Bitmin,giving hbox so much momentum and info
Bitmin,Maybe I'm biased because Dreamland is my favorite stage but I would never forfeit that game.
Bitmin,and it burns the fox player out
Bitmin,making them prone to make more mistakes in future games
Bitmin,The fact that this is even a discussion means the ruleset is broken
Bitmin,bans
Bitmin,id like to see the stats
Bitmin,of how much hbox wins on the fox's counterpick
Bitmin,after winning the second dreamland game
Bitmin,i guarantee its real high
Bitmin,why not just stand still on the counterpick
Bitmin,like honestly losing dreamland the first time might be better sometimes
Bitmin,plup is godlike
Bitmin,I think this is the first win vs Hbox since Plup won genesis
Bitmin,hbox hasnt lost so badly since mang0 at birthday bash
Bitmin,ggs
Bitmin,dreamland

Bitmin,This is Zack we are talking about
Bitmin,"@Homies I've recently discovered a game that I think could be great fun for our group if everyone is willing to learn it. It features highly asymmetric factions (apparently balanced), information trading, treachery, and alliance making and breaking. Tonight I am pretty free if people want to get together and play it on tabletop simulator. It plays best with 6 players so please let me know if you are interested. (The game is Dune)"
Bitmin,@Advanced Memers
Bitmin,"Players interested so far: Max, Chris, Devon, maybe Greg"
Bitmin,@Rotomotorz Were you interested?
Bitmin,maybe but depends on when u plan to play
Bitmin,"This evening, I suppose around 8:00 since that is when devon gets back"
Bitmin,I never said that
Bitmin,Where’s your proof
Bitmin,Please don't be difficult
Bitmin,I had that as an option so I could remove anyone who didn’t vote within the right demographic
Bitmin,Because I put it on a subreddit
Bitmin,Ty for taking my survey tho :)))
Bitmin,Dune sounds dumb
Bitmin,But any of you boys heard of zune?
Bitmin,Them boys play music
Bitmin,"Bruh a customer spent like $300 in the store and was like “I gotta stop spending so much money, I guess this is better than spending it on mafia city” and I was like “the phone app?” And this mf says “yeah I’ve sunk like $3000 into it with nothing to show for it”"
Bitmin,BRO

Bitmin,you're mother
Bitmin,I would make one but I dont know how
Bitmin,so yell at @Zain to do it
Bitmin,"I mean I can do it, but wouldn't it be better to have the server hosted by someone who lives closer to everyone cuz I'm not that close relative to a lot of people in the server"
Bitmin,Sounds just like someone who doesn't want to set up the server
Bitmin,We should probably pick a modpack first though
Bitmin,Do we want a more vanilla friendly pack? An rpg-esque pack? A tech heavy pack?
Bitmin,I mean I'll set it up doesn't matter to me and tech heavy in my opinion
Bitmin,"Check out crackpack 3, All the mods 4, engineer's life, valhelsia 2, enigmatica 4"
Bitmin,Those are all interesting looking ones
Bitmin,I'm fine with anything though
Bitmin,It's about hanging out with the boys

Bitmin,Crackpack seems kinda wack

Eventually realized that I'm arguing that the author is trying to show that a major component of good is to seek knowledge beyond that which is directly handed to you, and reaching that conclusion required me to put down the story he wrote and go read Plato to understand those four sentences. So yeah, I think I can get away with this."

- yelling at other players
- general toxicity
- being so loud that you can clearly make out whatever he's ranting about from the far side of the venue

But what finally got him the ban was unapolagetically using 'faggot' and 'gay'. This went over poorly with our TOs, who are:

Bitmin,This was one of the classes 3 major assignments and not meeting the visual aid requirement is an instant F. If they care so little they would just fail a major assignment why would they even be there.

Bitmin,I can pick for chris
Bitmin,let me think real quick
Bitmin,I would pick Nomads or Darklings
Bitmin,Darklings are bad for your first game

Bitmin,Requires direct adjacency (Nomad Power)
Bitmin,Place centrally
Bitmin,Don't go near the edge
Bitmin,Has no default ability
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane Instead of what?
Bitmin,yep
Bitmin,The 1 coin goes on the 6 coin
Bitmin,@Mr. Airplane
Bitmin,Devon has 1 extra coin

Bitmin,Sorry Devon
Bitmin,Did Devon do anything?
Bitmin,I think you skipped his turn?
Bitmin,ah
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,Science victory or nothing
Bitmin,Do we have that record saved?
Bitmin,@Eric Working From Home
Bitmin,im sure its like
Bitmin,something by zach
Bitmin,like
Bitmin,68 points
Bitmin,Took care of Chris's income
Bitmin,Don't forget your 5 points
Bitmin,@The Rona Don't forget you can burn power
Bitmin,If you need stuff
Bitmin,Place on brown unless you need 2 towns there
Bitmin,Digging for 3 workers is a terrible idea
Bitmin,burn power
Bitmin,You could use double dig power action and build on both reds
Bitmin,@The Rona
Bitmin,actually you need to build a dwelling on the empty space first
Bitmin,so they are both in range
Bitmin,yeah
Bitmin,Now just try and get coins
Bitmin,I did it
Bitmin,For you
Bitmin,It moved from bowl 1
Bitmin,Did you tell him you can turn workers to money?
Bitmin,You should highly consider the 6 coin bonus
Bitmin,Yeah I think so
Bitmin,Do you want me to get your income Chris?
Bitmin,2 power
Bitmin,"Now you can easily prep at least 1 town for the town bonus round, maybe even 2."
Bitmin,This is a bad impression of the game for Chris @Mr. Airplane
Bitmin,sure
Bitmin,Chris and I were making such a great plan
Bitmin,rip game

Bitmin,@Trapezoider I'll play melee in like 2 minutes

Bitmin,@Trapezoider
Bitmin,Do I need to resend the ISO?

Bitmin,Yup yup

Bitmin,"This is how IGN describes the new half life game after playing the first 4 hours ""It is the antidote to the open-world, procedurally generated busywork that’s become rampant in many other contemporary first-person shooters. Every moment seems to have been painstakingly hand-crafted. Every scene serves a purpose. The pacing is more deliberate. In short, Valve wants you to be in City 17, and you’ll want to be there too, Headcrabs and all."""

Bitmin,we still have no particularly nearby cases but it's only a matter of time
Bitmin,There were a few cases in burlington yesterday
Bitmin,Mohawk aint done shit and theres cases in Burly and Hammiltoin

Bitmin,Yeah same

Bitmin,Gyazo
Bitmin,this some bullshit
Bitmin,What blizzard game do you even play?
Bitmin,cod
Bitmin,what do you guys think of these character designs?
Bitmin,One thing you might want to consider is that the girl's shirt looks like an Easter egg pattern. Whether or not you want that is up to you.
Bitmin,very saturated and clashing colors
Bitmin,Easter Egg pattern?
Bitmin,oh yeah it does lol
Bitmin,
Bitmin,it looks like a typical design you'd find on an easter egg
Bitmin,kinda like this
Bitmin,oh Shirt! I thought you said Skirt.
Bitmin,"but yeah, that's what the original shirt looked like, so I went with it"
Bitmin,but i think the dark blue on gray is no bueno
Bitmin,Original?
Bitmin,the values are way too similar you can hardly see the design
Bitmin,allow me to explain
Bitmin,I build my character designs by using bits and pieces from other designs...
Bitmin,this is where I got the shirt and jacket
Bitmin,Those colours work better
Bitmin,I agree ^
Bitmin,better contrast
Bitmin,thats what im sayin
Bitmin,so maybe change the color of the vest?
Bitmin,No
Bitmin,The actual shirt itself
Bitmin,the shirt or the design
Bitmin,on the shirt
Bitmin,make it contrast
Bitmin,really? I think the black and blue go well together
Bitmin,either the pattern colour or the base shirt colour
Bitmin,they're way too similar
Bitmin,the design fades into the shirt
Bitmin,hmm alright
Bitmin,but i would also recommend toning down the vest as it is much to bright and saturated
Bitmin,also the male character's hair is wayyyyy too blue and bright as well
Bitmin,he looks like Sonic
Bitmin,how about a white shirt instead of black?
Bitmin,also the whole thing is a bit generic
Bitmin,yeah that seems better
Bitmin,
Bitmin,yes better
Bitmin,maybe now you should change the socks too
Bitmin,maybe now she needs white socks
Bitmin,"and I agree. The guy looks a little too monotone. I want the blue hair, so what other colors should be changed"
Bitmin,yeah I'd say white socks + black on the shoes
Bitmin,but i dont think the blue hair would work with anything
Bitmin,it doesn't suit the art style
Bitmin,well maybe idk
Bitmin,"something else to keep in mind....... these aren't ""natural"" designs either. Like no one could have a ponytail that long and think (don't take that out of context)"
Bitmin,omg
Bitmin,i know this bro
Bitmin,i make really unrealistic designs of blue dogs
Bitmin,but there still are principals of character design
Bitmin,"I'm aware. Like I said, I think the guy looks a little monotone, so I feel like some colors should be changed"
Bitmin,probably the bandada
Bitmin,"other than his hair, because I want to keep the blue hair"
Bitmin,bandana
Bitmin,i didnt even see it at first since it matched the shirt color
Bitmin,"hmm, ok. Or I could change his shirt."
Bitmin,true
Bitmin,but if you change the shirt make sure it doesnt clash with the vest or pants
Bitmin,"but I feel like something other than black. Because then he'd look a little too ""dark"""
Bitmin,well he's got blue jeans. Almost anything goes with blue jeans
Bitmin,i also think the shoes look a tad out of place since there is not brown anywhere else
Bitmin,maybe you could make something else brown
Bitmin,this is where I got the body for his design.
Bitmin,wow you barely changed a thing
Bitmin,he also looks very generic
Bitmin,like all harem protagonists
Bitmin,yeah and thats not good
Bitmin,give him a mohawk
Bitmin,are you making a harem?
Bitmin,Not with this guy
Bitmin,i think the outfit is just kinda plain
Bitmin,needs something else
Bitmin,"Well I gave him a scarf, so I thought that added something"
Bitmin,yeah but idk I personally dont like his vest thingy
Bitmin,but thats just me
Bitmin,anyone else?
Bitmin,I think you're a weeb
Bitmin,are you an artist at all?
Bitmin,or are you just making designs to get other people to draw them
Bitmin,No. Hence why I use other design pieces to make mine
Bitmin,hmm
Bitmin,I can't even draw lines without screwing them up
Bitmin,well thats because you probably havent really practiced
Bitmin,that's how bad an artist I am
Bitmin,bruh
Bitmin,everyone starts off bad
Bitmin,you're bad for AT LEAST a solid year
Bitmin,usually way longer
Bitmin,did it also come across to you I don't feel like becoming an artist. I'd rather not spend a year practicing a skill I'll never use
Bitmin,fair ig
Bitmin,you didnt say that at all tho
Bitmin,"but i mean,, art isnt really a skill you never use if you, yknow, draw"
Bitmin,Eh
Bitmin,i find a lot of fulfillment in drawing for the sake of drawing but i know not everyone's like that
Bitmin,but its not a pointless skill
Bitmin,Did I ever show you guys my commissions I had done?
Bitmin,you showed us one
Bitmin,fair
Bitmin,lol what kind of response is that
Bitmin,well there's just one more I plan to get done when his next session opens up
Bitmin,oh so you've only had one done so far
Bitmin,I've actually had 2
Bitmin,1 character done twice
Bitmin,i thought one of them was a group photo
Bitmin,"there's the group photo, but there's also the single one, which I had done first"
Bitmin,this one was more a test
Bitmin,aaa thats pretty cute
Bitmin,I do really like this one.
Bitmin,same shirt design as your new character tho
Bitmin,this character I mean
Bitmin,because I use the same one lol
Bitmin,huh?
Bitmin,"I wanted to give her a short sleeved shirt with a vest, and that was the best I could find"
Bitmin,"tbf, her design was made long before the one I just showed you"
Bitmin,yeah but that doesn't mean you should give your other characters the same clothes lol
Bitmin,"eh, whether I give these guys full life or not is still in the air. I just made them to kill some time"
Bitmin,fair ig
Bitmin,use that creativity tho bro
Bitmin,this is the girl I plan to get commissioned next.
Bitmin,who is probably my favorite character of them all
Bitmin,:o cute
Bitmin,"A lot of my fans of the fanfiction I write also like her. In fact, in a poll I did on my server, she ranked the highest out of all the others"
Bitmin,how many people you got in that server? :0
Bitmin,You have a big enough fan base to have a discord server?
Bitmin,wow
Bitmin,"let me check the action number, cause I can't remember"
Bitmin,"Well I've got 34 on the server, but not all of my fans are on my server"
Bitmin,if I look at my ff.net account (which is where I post the fanfic)
Bitmin,"the story has 26 followers, so add that to the 34 on my server"
Bitmin,wow
Bitmin,Wow the vanguard wiki even has a page for your alternate universe
Bitmin,WHAT
Bitmin,ARE YOU FR
Bitmin,how'd you find that out???
Bitmin,google
Bitmin,please send me link
Bitmin,"plus there are the ones who don't follow the story or on my server, but I know they're reading it."
Bitmin,Those I can't count
Bitmin,did you add that page yourself
Bitmin,"if it's on the fanon wiki, than yes, I added it myself"
Bitmin,https://cardfightvanguardfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cardfight!!_Vanguard_X
Bitmin,Cardfight!! Vanguard X
Bitmin,Cardfight!! Vanguard X is a fan fiction series made by mrd256. It acts as a sequel to G that takes place 20 years later.
Bitmin,there's a link to the fanfic on this page
Bitmin,"just a fair warning, the fanfic might contain a few missing words here and there, and a few grammar mistakes, but I'm trying to get better"
Bitmin,well idk anything about the original story so
Bitmin,you actually really don't need to understand the original story to get this.
Bitmin,"since it takes place in the future and has it's own story.

also, if they recall back the events in the canon, then I throw in a short summery of what happened"
Bitmin,"for example, in one of the most recent chapters, two canon characters, who are friends with the heroine's father, explain how they became friends with him, which are actual events that happened in the original show."
Bitmin,"still, i think its odd to read fanfiction if you've never watched/read/whatever the source. I know some people disagree with me though !"
Bitmin,"eh, I somewhat agree with you"
Bitmin,the story also has over 400 views and 31 reviews
Bitmin,What's most valuable lesson you learned while writing this? I plan on writing a book in a few months so some tips would be appreciated.
Bitmin,"something is, write every character like they are the protagonist of their own story."
Bitmin,"obviously you have you story's main protagonist, but in reality, everyone leads their own life"
Bitmin,"So you should reflect that in your stories. Give them personalities that flow with their back stories, and maybe put a little twist on them if you can"
Bitmin,My story has 4 maybe 5 point of view characters so I'll definitely need to do this
Bitmin,"for example, maybe a character had a tragic back story, but they act all happy and cheerful"
Bitmin,maybe use that happy and cheerful personality as way for them to cover up their pain and despair
Bitmin,"and when their tragic event is brought up, you (the viewer) sees a different side to them you never thought they had"
Bitmin,that can be a key to make 2 or even 3 dimensional characters
Bitmin,I've been planning my story for almost a year so I hope it goes well once I start
Bitmin,I always think of ideas for stories but this one is my favorite of them all
Bitmin,I've never had one develop so fully before
Bitmin,"all stories can take time, but sometimes, a good strategy is to release 1 chapter/1 volume at a time. This will make the view anxious or curious as to what's gonna happen next"
Bitmin,"also, it gives you time to learn what you did wrong in previous chapters and learn from them to improve future ones"
Bitmin,I'm still trying to decide if I should release my story chapter by chapter or wait until the whole thing is done. I'm leaning towards waiting until its done so I can present the best possible product.
Bitmin,I'll probably have a small number of test readers who read it live though
Bitmin,I kinda like to do both
Bitmin,"if I have a story that's fairly short, I'll just release the whole thing at once"
Bitmin,"but Vanguard X is a pretty long story, spanning across a total of 4 seasons, and 2 spin off series."
Bitmin,"where the story lies right now, I'm entering the last chapter of the first arc of season 1"
Bitmin,I've never written a serious project like this so I have no idea how long it will end up being
Bitmin,well your first project is always gonna suck. No matter what it is
Bitmin,I do know it has three main parts though
Bitmin,I hope to avoid that
Bitmin,I have done some less serious projects to practice
Bitmin,I didn't mean to discourage you
Bitmin,"For me personally, I try to keep a positive mindset."
Bitmin,I think it leads to the best results.
Bitmin,That is true
Bitmin,and that's something I envy about you.
Bitmin,"lately, I've had a hard time staying positive with all the crap that's been going on in my life"
Bitmin,Good luck getting though it
Bitmin,It's actually gotten to the point where I need to see a therapist
Bitmin,I've already got an appointment scheduled next week
Bitmin,I've never been to therapy so I don't know much about it but I hope it helps
Bitmin,me too
Bitmin,"well it's about time for me to hit the hay. I have work tomorrow, so I'm gonna try and get some sleep"
Bitmin,good night

Bitmin,wait what?? how are we supposed to make them
Bitmin,Don't ask others
Bitmin,ok
Bitmin,
Bitmin,450 is a lot
Bitmin,I dont care how you make them
Bitmin,You just need to draw in a single color over the vessels
Bitmin,and another color over the brain reigons (blue)
Bitmin,you need 450 of the first image you sent?
Bitmin,you can probably just use photoshop filters
Bitmin,I have to create all this fucking training data so I can make a computer automatically do it
Bitmin,Wait
Bitmin,You want me to recreate the same image
Bitmin,with different colours?
Bitmin,you are basically just creating a label that says
Bitmin,HEY
Bitmin,these pixels are blood vessles
Bitmin,Ok wait hol up
Bitmin,and these other pixels are NOT blood vessels
Bitmin,okay send me the files
Bitmin,it just has to be too colors
Bitmin,wait i wanna do some too
Bitmin,uploading them to g drive rn
Bitmin,its going to take all night
Bitmin,because I was a fucking retard with the way I extracted these
Bitmin,and I don't want to redo it lol
Bitmin,"they don't all have to be done by the same person, right?"
Bitmin,ehhh honestly it would be best if the same person did it because I am willing to bet there are variations in the way different people would label these images
Bitmin,so anyone who is interested can fight amongst the other people who want the job
Bitmin,Ill let the free market work in my favor here 
Bitmin,I NEED IT
Bitmin,DIBS
Bitmin,
Bitmin,I just need my labelled images ASAP and as cheap as possible
Bitmin,Gonna make fat stacks
Bitmin,
Bitmin,i bet i could do it faster than you
Bitmin,race
Bitmin,Wait so
Bitmin,You have a big foler of a bunch of images similar to this
Bitmin,"or like, each start from opposite ends and meet in the middle"
Bitmin,That you just need in different colours?
Bitmin,Are they all coloured in purple and yellow?
Bitmin,Oh wait
Bitmin,a
Bitmin,minute
Bitmin,I get it
Bitmin,Actually small append
Bitmin,BLACK for vessels
Bitmin,WHITE for brain reigons
Bitmin,and yes I am willing to have a race
Bitmin,Ava will start from the bottom of the folder
Bitmin,chris will start from the top
Bitmin,wait how is that a race then
Bitmin,wtf
Bitmin,whoever gets halfway through first has to do the rest?
Bitmin,what ab out me
Bitmin,whoever reaches the halfway point first
Bitmin,okay chris starts at the top
Bitmin,dober starts at the 1 /3
Bitmin,OKAY FUCK THIS
Bitmin,that seems like a waste of time tho for whoever doesnt win
Bitmin,Just fight amongst yourselves and decide who gets the job
Bitmin,i'm going to bed!
Bitmin,what format are the files in?
Bitmin,JPG
Bitmin,bruh
Bitmin,needs more JPG
Bitmin,smh bad business man just abandoning things
Bitmin,Wrong
Bitmin,I am going to let the market work in my favor while sleeping
Bitmin,When I wakeup someone will have won the contract by out bidding there components for who can do the work cheapest and quickest  Or if you guys are really smart you will conspire by electing 1 person to officially take the job. Demanding a hire wage for that person. Then splitting the work amongst yourselfs
Bitmin,  Food for thought  ? 
Bitmin,i thought you said one person had to do them all
Bitmin,"don't condescend me, buddy"

Bitmin,@Eric Working From Home @Feral Nebula I figured out another way to do that thing I was gonna pay you guys for. Sorry for not following up
Bitmin,was it automated photoshop filters
Bitmin,because if not y'all are dumb
Bitmin,I actually went in and changed the colors pixel by pixel
Bitmin,@Sak von Sak Actually needed it done semi manually
Bitmin,I was having them create training data
Bitmin,But someone showed me how to do it with an edge detection filter + fill programmatically
Bitmin,So I could iterate over lots of images quickly
Bitmin,there's literally a photoshop thing that does that
Bitmin,and photoshop has functionality to automate it over a whole bunch of images
Bitmin,Thats good to know for future reference
Bitmin,I dont have photoshop though so I was unaware 
Bitmin,i just changed it to CYMK image and went into the cyan channel and turned it off

Bitmin,"There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.
All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.
IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.
IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.
Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.
Cognitive ability is substantially heritable, apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent."

Bitmin,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence.
Bitmin,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence. Then by continually bouncing off the slippers and the bed we can generate enough momentum to clip through the floor and skip the window sequence.

Bitmin,@everyone games cs ow ?
Bitmin,@here
Bitmin,games
Bitmin,SURE
Bitmin,i guess thats a no from everone else lol
Bitmin,So I just thought of an interesting challenge.
Bitmin,"I call it the ""Bottom Tier Challenge""

You take the lowest tiered character in some kind of competitive fighting game (like Smash), and you keep doing random join ups with random people, until you get a legitimate victory using that character.

here's what counts as a legitimate victory. You have to win via the conditions set in the rules. You cannot win via a timeout, or your opponent disconnects.

You stop play at all before you get a legit win, you fail the challenge."
Bitmin,very neat idea
Bitmin,Have you won this challenge in any games?
Bitmin,I have not.
Bitmin,Also @Max you were up pretty early this morning

Bitmin,no
Bitmin,dont get it
Bitmin,alright tuning into 5 streams rn
Bitmin,is it any more effective to have multiple streams open?
Bitmin,idk if this works but in theory you could open a stream and mute it so your twitch default opens streams muted them jsut go to the valorant directory and middle click each stream to open them all then ctrl+tab through them all so they are all marked as open then just minimize hte window
Bitmin,cause you dont have to actually have hte stream unmuted on an active window to recieve drops
Bitmin,@Cs:go

Bitmin,I'll probably play in the 8 est 10 man but I may only play one game. It depends on how much of my work I can get done before then.
Bitmin,Looks like I now have a chemistry test every week since I was off for like a month lol 
Bitmin,beep boop
Bitmin,@Jed You can use my valorant account when I aint playing

- Zack
- Kameron
- Greg || Jed
- Ben
- Ben ^2
- Smithy
- Max"
Bitmin,oh boy apparently the Valorant anti-cheat has root-level access to your computer 24/7
Bitmin,we have all handed riot our entire computers
Bitmin,@The Rona I forgot to add zain and since you were last you are out 
Bitmin,Sounds like Zain's problem
Bitmin,‍♂️
Bitmin,Nah dude
Bitmin,"so yeah even if they weren't already, China now owns your entire computer"
Bitmin,uh
Bitmin,"""Ring-0 is essentially the lowest level something can run in.

Running in this permission level essentially means that a given driver has full administrative access to your operating system before it even throws a login screen. It can monitor the boot process, check every driver and device that loads at boot (at least after it's loaded), and can run arbitrary code without any input or knowledge from the user.

It doesn't matter whether you're logged in or not, or whether you've even played the game recently. It is ALWAYS running."""
Bitmin,and uninstalling Valorant won't uninstall the monitoring
Bitmin,so we have to reinstall windows?
Bitmin,wait i'm not sure that's true
Bitmin,you can uninstall it manually but it's a separate thing
Bitmin,and significantly more complicated
Bitmin,I saw someone talking about this in a stream too
Bitmin,It is true
Bitmin,wtf
Bitmin,Wait so am I not in the 10 man
Bitmin,Rip
Bitmin,and posts about this stuff is getting banned on r/valorant
Bitmin,Also people were reporting performance loss in other games due to this
Bitmin,so what do I need to delete?
Bitmin,whoops
Bitmin,@Matt I forgot about max too
Bitmin,Max has your spot sorry buddy
Bitmin,Whew
Bitmin,Accept the Chinese Communist Party into your heart
Bitmin,
Bitmin,this is riots response to it
Bitmin,yeah what do I delete
Bitmin,Why did you delete that
Bitmin,"If you delete it, then you can't play the game"
Bitmin,"there's some control panel level stuff, here's the thread I'm seeing: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/g0gdug/riots_trusted_valorant_mods_deleted_a_thread/"
Bitmin,r/pcgaming - Riot's 'Trusted' /Valorant mods deleted a thread about...
Bitmin,"9,084 votes and 1,544 comments so far on Reddit"
Bitmin,
Bitmin,but then yeah you can't play the game
Bitmin,"TL;DR Yes we run a driver at system startup, it doesn't scan anything (unless the game is running), it's designed to take up as few system resources as possible and it doesn't communicate to our servers. You can remove it at anytime.

Vanguard contains a driver component called vgk.sys (similar to other anti-cheat systems), it's the reason why a reboot is required after installing. Vanguard doesn't consider the computer trusted unless the Vanguard driver is loaded at system startup (this part is less common for anti-cheat systems).

This is good for stopping cheaters because a common way to bypass anti-cheat systems is to load cheats before the anti-cheat system starts and either modify system components to contain the cheat or to have the cheat tamper with the anti-cheat system as it loads. Running the driver at system startup time makes this significantly more difficult.

We've tried to be very careful with the security of the driver. We've had multiple external security research teams review it for flaws (we don't want to accidentally decrease the security of the computer like other anti-cheat drivers have done in the past). We're also following a least-privilege approach to the driver where the driver component does as little as possible preferring to let the non-driver component do the majority of work (also the non-driver component doesn't run unless the game is running)."
Bitmin,I'd rather not play the game then have my data mined
Bitmin,"The Vanguard driver does not collect or send any information about your computer back to us. Any cheat detection scans will be run by the non-driver component only when the game is running.

The Vanguard driver can be uninstalled at any time (it'll be ""Riot Vanguard"" in Add/Remove programs) and the driver component does not collect any information from your computer or communicate over the network at all.

We think this is an important tool in our fight against cheaters but the important part is that we're here so that players can have a good experience with Valorant and if our security tools do more harm than good we will remove them (and try something else). For now we think a run-at-boot time driver is the right choice."
Bitmin,thats the riot response
Bitmin,Lets review the fax
Bitmin,bullshit
Bitmin,literally no one else does this and it's functionally malware
Bitmin,riot is conviniently owned by 10cent
Bitmin,they can run anything they want on your computer with this
Bitmin,it's also not stopping hackers
Bitmin,"and even assuming there's no malicious intent, the second this gets cracked fuckin anyone who wants gets root level access to your computer and can do malicious things with it"
Bitmin,antivirus software does this
Bitmin,yes but our antivirus software isn't owned by a company owned by China
Bitmin,a country famous for not invading privacy for malicious purposes
Bitmin,"also, people are already beating the anticheat"
Bitmin,so it's not insane to assume someone has or will soon beat the security and boom we're all even more compromised
Bitmin,apparently this is an article response to it https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/dev-null-anti-cheat-kernel-driver/
Bitmin,/dev/null: Anti-Cheat Kernel Driver - League of Legends
Bitmin,We’re protecting some of Riot’s upcoming games with new anti-cheat systems.
Bitmin,yeh I still don't really trust it
Bitmin,"because no matter what it's still extremely sketchy to need that level of access, especially if it's not working"
Bitmin,yeah if we are going this tin foil hat then there is literally nothing any one could say
Bitmin,yup
Bitmin,but there's plenty of good reasons to tinfoil hat on this one
Bitmin,Yeah literally
Bitmin,namely the censorship of r/valorant
Bitmin,"on the other hand, there's no real reason to panic cause odds are your computer's already hella compromised"
Bitmin,fusion doesnt use a vpn when he torrents all of those games so i doubt hes scared of anyone
Bitmin,ok if we are worried about the big bad tencent and china then we must be worried about all of these companies as well right https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/
Bitmin,Every game company that Tencent has invested in
Bitmin,A quick reference of how China's largest tech conglomerate has quietly expanded into videogames.
Bitmin,@Jed
Bitmin,have my spot
Bitmin,@Zain
Bitmin,"yes, yes I am Zain"
Bitmin,but none of them have installed root-level permission software on my computer
Bitmin,Zack you can get so much information off of discord but why do you still use this application when Tencent has invested in it as well
Bitmin,"like, on one hand, I'm still gonna play Valorant because I assume everything I do is already tracked by at least someone sketchy because realistically you can't avoid it, but on the other hand, I think people should understand what's going on

also are you insane in comparing what they can get out of discord vs. always on root access"
Bitmin,if we are worried about selling our information or compromising or security this would priority number one no?
Bitmin,"discord can't run any code it wants with any level of permission on my computer without me knowing about it
discord can't see every single thing I do on my computer
discord can't look at every single file on my computer at all times"
Bitmin,"discord can see what I put into discord: messages, voice, occasionally video, what game I'm playing, and the files I post"
Bitmin,ok sure

Bitmin,"Copied from another server: PLEASE do not play TF2 or ANY source games in the meantime. A serious leak of source code has been reportedly leaked into the public. If true, it means source games are easily compromised and you should not play them at the moment.What this means is cheaters could potentially install programs or get information from your PC through source games if true.(Allegedly) the developer of cathook has discovered a way to RCE (remote code execute) on TF2 just by you being in the server. This allows anyone who does this to run any code on your computer, including viruses, turning your game into an aimbot, or deleting your items. Playing any source game, including TF2 is dangerous right now, and we suggest not playing until there is some kind of fix for this."

Bitmin,"We have reviewed the leaked code and believe it to be a reposting of a limited CS:GO engine code depot released to partners in late 2017, and originally leaked in 2018. From this review, we have not found any reason for players to be alarmed or avoid the current builds."

Bitmin,"wtf is this ""home row"" you talkin about"
Bitmin,ever noticed how f and j have marks on them
Bitmin,its so blind people can use keyboards but it also what is referred to as homerow and if you place your hands there you should be able to hit every key without moving your wrists
Bitmin,sarcasm doesnt work through text
Bitmin,that was not sarcasm
Bitmin,"wtf is this ""home row"" you talkin aboutsarcasm doesnt work text only"
Bitmin,ah you mean you were being sarcastic

Bitmin,true
Bitmin,i am now too afraid to respond to anything on the chance that its sarcasm
Bitmin,very true
Bitmin,I mean I think the reason is so that you can easily find those keys without looking away from the screen

Bitmin,I have no idea what to do

Bitmin,
Bitmin,This is not what he is referring to
Bitmin,We played a game in class months ago where we stood in a circle and played some adding game
Bitmin,I do not remember the exact rules though
Bitmin,wtf is this class it sounds really retarded
Bitmin,It's public speaking
Bitmin,Not like you could figure that out from the test questions though lol
Bitmin,owch
Bitmin,You know something's up when you don't know even remotely what class someone is by looking at test questions
Bitmin,This is the least relevant test I've ever seen
Bitmin,Most of the questions are normal but like 20% are garbage like above
Bitmin,"I don't know if what I said sounded insulting, but believe me, I'm only insulting the test."
Bitmin,
Bitmin,ikd max but that sounds like an insult
Bitmin,I wrote it poorly
Bitmin,I was trashing the test
Bitmin,not you
Bitmin,if i had to take a guess i'd say its some type of philisophical course but like
Bitmin,lol
Bitmin,"Sorry Benson, I only realized it could sound like an insult towards you like 30 seconds after sending it"
Bitmin,Definitely was not my intention
