Greg,"Ok so all this server is a hub for friends to play games, chat, hangout, and genrally have fun. This server is ment to be a replacement for the orginal frostbite server that has become very large and unwieldy. The orginal frostbite server has also become very inactive and stagnate as a result of its size. That is why am hopeing to keep this community relatively small so that we can be active and have fun."

Greg,?

Greg,cause the other company got bought out
Greg,so now I can watch youtube
Greg,cause the new one doesn't block it
Greg,your parents blocked youtube?
Greg,yea
Greg,what
Greg,why
Greg,my parents have a router extension thing that has customisable filters
Greg,cause they don't trust me apperently
Greg,they were so caught up in what they could do that they didn't stop to think about whether or not they SHOULD
Greg,also what do they think you're doing on youtube? watching porn?
Greg,yup
Greg,I'm like 95% sure that's not something you can do
Greg,I'm gonna assume that youtube filters that kind of thing
Greg,also do they not realize there are much better sources of that kind of thing?
Greg,"besides, something I've learned from pranking friends on school computers is that it's impossible to block ALL of the porn"
Greg,although you might not want to tell your parents that
Greg,oh I know that
Greg,oh
Greg,I don't get their reasoning
Greg,but its not blocked now

Greg,I did
Greg,its the chronological order all the marvel movies take place in timeline wise
Greg,How was this timeline created?
Greg,people with alot of time on their hands
Greg,i mean it makes sense
Greg,starts with first captain america and ends with guardians of the galaxy
Greg,What the hell is Cloak & Dagger?
Greg,unreleased stuff
Greg,clock can travel into different dimensions and dagger kills people
Greg,its a little tv series that hasnt come out yet
Greg,"""clock"""
Greg,cloak*
Greg,lol
Greg,I wasn't doubting the validness(?) of the timeline
Greg,I was just wondering how they determined it
Greg,Because I am interested in that stuff
Greg,for the released stuff its kinda obvious
Greg,since they use specific dates in the actual movies
Greg,so you can jsut be like oh yeah
Greg,there it is
Greg,and for the unreleased stuff i think its jsut Theory Crafting
Greg,okay so the list of currently Released Movies we need to watch in Order is...
Greg,"Captain America 1
Iron Man 1

Greg,I gotta go to work but legit think about it maybe over march break @The Rona
Greg,not all in one day obv
Greg,I'm down
Greg,yo lit
Greg,ill try and figure out which ones are on netflix and which ones ill need to pirate
Greg,bad
Greg,???
Greg,Pirating things is wrong
Greg,it is stealing
Greg,and if everyone did it no more movies would be made
Greg,just think about that
Greg,http://puu.sh/ujKXT/d8381d16a8.jpg
Greg,and by pirating something when not everyone else does it is like saying you are better than them
Greg,most things you dont even need to pirate
Greg,you know photoshop?
Greg,and other adobe products
Greg,i have the files from adobe im using their files
Greg,not third party
Greg,i just know how to mess with the security on it and make my free trial go from lasting 7 days to 1000 days
Greg,that is stealing and wrong
Greg,no third party programs or software adobe jsut has really loose security for being such a large company
Greg,thats on them
Greg,if a store had no alarm system and just a bad lock would it be okay to steal from that store?
Greg,no becuase that is stealing not pirating
Greg,PIRACY IS STEALING
Greg,there is no a finite amount of computer programs or files
Greg,there is a finite amount of objects
Greg,but you still obtain something without payment to the creator
Greg,"Piracy is a Victimless Crime, Stealing is not."
Greg,NO
Greg,if you made something and everyone pirated it you would be very upset becasue you would make 0 MONEY
Greg,"if its a small startup or something like and indie game/film from a small company i will pay for their products and support them if i think its worth my money, but if its a large company like Adobe or Marvel where my 1 Aquisition without payment will not affect them then i feel no shame in doing what i do"
Greg,how can you even defend yourself? you know its illegal and wrong yet you try to come up with reasons why it is okay even though you know you wouldn't like it if someone pirated something you made
Greg,Big companies deserve money for their work just as much as small ones
Greg,im not trying to defend myself
Greg,am i doing something illegal? yes.
Greg,do i feel remorse? no.
Greg,Piracy is Comparable to Jaywalking
Greg,yeah its illegal but nobody cares
Greg,that is so untrue
Greg,@The Rona I mgiht be Busy March 11-15 but im free the other days of march break i believe
Greg,@here games bois?
Greg,maybe
Greg,i'm kinda enjoying my pokemon and chill session ive got going on tho
Greg,you should join me and chris for a pokemans nuzlocke challenge at some point
Greg,Yo boyd
Greg,In a work meeting
Greg,I'm literally never not pirating something
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL It's ok I support your pirating 110%
Greg,thanks fam
Greg,np
Greg,"to put my two cents in about pirating, yeah it's illegal, yeah it's morally wrong, but it's prevelant enough that most companies work it into their assumptions about how much money they can make and at that point it's become so standard that it almost doesn't matter"
Greg,but personally
Greg,Sylki join so we can play my game when doctor comes back
Greg,"I only pirate stuff like books I can get from the library but am too lazy to walk to, old games that I'd be getting second hand so the original creators don't make any money anyway, or software that I already own but it's on my old computer and a massive pain to transfer"
Greg,doc is back btw
Greg,and textbooks cause they're crazy overpriced and there's no way to know if you're actually gonna need them till like 1/3 of the way through the course
Greg,also I'm busy and I'm not gonna be able to play tonight
Greg,okay
Greg,also how do you even pirate a textbook?
Greg,@The Rona Older misha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tSZEMc1CVk

Greg,Have you heard of M.C. Escher before Quick?
Greg,He's the artist of that picture
Greg,He has a whole bunch of stuff like that that breaks perspective and positioning and it's super neat
Greg,I've only ever heard of him as the person who drew this picture
Greg,I had never heard of him before now
Greg,His stuff is pretty cool
Greg,honestly he's one of my favourite artists
Greg,he fiddles with the ways you have to draw to give the illusion of a third dimension in order to make trippy geometrically impossible pictures and they're always super interesting
Greg,"so I'm studying for a test tomorrow, and the prof posts old tests, and when I was talking to one of my friends who took the course last year, they said this test was basically impossible and everyone did horribly, and I kinda throught they were exaggerating"

Greg,Who?
Greg,WHOOOOOOOO
Greg,Whooooo
Greg,Orisa
Greg,?
Greg,Go-to play overwatch
Greg,"What is this, a discord for owls?"
Greg,On YouTube
Greg,Send links
Greg,wow the alt fire sounds super OP
Greg,Yeah it does
Greg,She look really good
Greg,Also Bastion is getting a small nerf
Greg,"Instead of 35% damage resistance, they are lowering it to 20%"
Greg,Why do they gotta release the new hero when I have a test tomorrow ;-;
Greg,I don't think its for a while yet
Greg,Is just on ptr thou
Greg,She's on the PTR
Greg,The new hero sounds pretty bad
Greg,How so?
Greg,Her weapon slows her while firing
Greg,Also abilities just sound kinda useless in general
Greg,Non moving shields aren't that useful
Greg,Because people move a lot in overwatch
Greg,Fortify just sounds really dumb
Greg,If you slow down whole shooting
Greg,*while
Greg,Thoughts? @The Rona
Greg,How you gonna sit there and do my ass like that
Greg,I don't think the slowing while firing matters too too much
Greg,Especially since we don't know her damage right now
Greg,Depending on the shield cool-down the non moving might not be a problem
Greg,"The alt-fire seems pretty good, mini grav + hook, and it slows you"
Greg,I have more too add but I am in chem right now
Greg,I think that her abilities are counterproductive
Greg,Shut up
Greg,@Mr. Airplane The alt fire can be used to pull people off of high ground
Greg,also dva slows down when she shoots and she's pretty good
Greg,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Greg,900
Greg,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Greg,900
Greg,"So, her gun it pretty good"
Greg,it's a bit weird tho
Greg,looks like it should be hitscan
Greg,isn't hitscan
Greg,"Yeah, it's projectiles"
Greg,seems strong tho
Greg,"she could be good, we'll have to see"
Greg,i like the gravity thing she has
Greg,welp I was just on a team with a 76 and a mccree who couldn't kill their idiot pharah

Greg,new hero?
Greg,yee boy
Greg,seems pretty cool. I could see playing her with mercy on defense instead of ana
Greg,I'm pretty sure the damage boost from her ult doesn't stack with Mercy's
Greg,that would make since
Greg,I have a feeling she's going to be the go to second tank in a bastion meta
Greg,esspecially on defense
Greg,"I can see her + rein being really infuriating to deal with, cause you're got two decently sized shields with the whole team hiding behind them, if you get too close you have to deal with the rein hammer and if you stay far out you have to deal with her machine gun mowing people down"
Greg,does her grav thing pull through shields?
Greg,it goes through shields
Greg,I don't think her gun has falloff damage
Greg,"nah I mean if you detonate it in front of a shield, will it pull the people behind it?"
Greg,it does for sure
Greg,starts at like 25-30 meters
Greg,wait
Greg,maybe not
Greg,I think it might pull through shields
Greg,I'm pretty sure there is no falloff
Greg,It's just her spread
Greg,spread gets crazy there though
Greg,making you hit less
Greg,I could see people getting crazy environmental kills with her grav though
Greg,like indoor nepal
Greg,I wonder if it pulls through walls
Greg,like Zarya's graviton
Greg,I dont think so
Greg,it looks like it needs los
Greg,You could use it on that wall on Lijang
Greg,If it doesn't need los
Greg,you wouldn't need the wall just shoot it off the stage and detonate it
Greg,true
Greg,Also I don't know if you guys know this but when she uses her fortify ability she gets a 50% damage resistance (I think)
Greg,but that makes me think that it shouldn't be able to pull through shields

Greg,new sm4sh tier list!
Greg,ROB dropped 13 places
Greg,rip
Greg,gg ROB
Greg,wait actually only 5
Greg,was looking at the wrong old tier list
Greg,Good mistake
Greg,still he's now in the bottom half of the list
Greg,why is sonic 5th
Greg,there's like one player who does ok with sonic ever and he's actually a cloud main
Greg,only 1.5 people do well with falco in melee and he is second
Greg,1.5?
Greg,mango is .5
Greg,westballz is 1
Greg,I see
Greg,and even westballz uses fox for certain matchups
Greg,so maybe 1.2?
Greg,"TIL Samuel L Jackson likes anime

Greg,Samuel L. Jackson Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions | WI...
Greg,"yes, but there's a lot of decent falco players or players with decent falcos"
Greg,you look at the top 50 or so players and there are a lot of falcos
Greg,Isn't ppmd a good falco?
Greg,"you look at sm4sh top 50, first sign of a sonic is at 12th, and the guy barely plays sonic anymore, instead focusing on cloud, and even then he doesn't have particularly good results"
Greg,He's a Marth main yeah
Greg,and the other 3 sonics in the top 50 never make top 8
Greg,rarely make top 16
Greg,"and yet he's over 4 characters who have won majors (mario, mewtwo, marth, zss)"
Greg,also somehow bayo snuck out on top
Greg,she's definately high/top tier but not the best in the game
Greg,don't think bayo's ever done better than 4th or 5th at majors
Greg,yeah her best ever result at a major (even pre-nerf) is 4th and somehow she's considered the best character in the game
Greg,What is the criteria for the tier list  though?
Greg,"it's also funny looking at this tier list in relation to kingston sm4sh, where, based on our current PR (which admittadly has some odd parts), from #1 down through the honourable mentions, we play 28th, 35th, 38th (working on switching to 4th), 36th, 17th, 40th, 7th/43rd (and he's far better at 43rd), 12th, 47th, 23rd/11th, and then honourable mentions play 12th/6th, 6th/37th, and 4th"
Greg,everyone who plays a character in S or A tier (1-12) are all 7th or worse
Greg,Your number 1 player plays DK?
Greg,"I'm pretty sure the list is supposed to be based on how good the character is on paper, which imo is kind of dumb when in some cases there's little to no proof that they're that good in practice, and some characters who suck on paper have pretty good results"
Greg,yeah DKBill
Greg,"DK, Ike, Shulk (trying to get a sheik going), wario, villager, g&w, fox/little mac (way better at little mac, is gonna be climbing back up now that he's switched back), ryu, kirby, captain falcon/zss"
Greg,"not counting the guy working on swtiching to sheik, our only person who plays an s-tier is an honourable mention"

Greg,chikon hard reads - ava and fusion facists
Greg,we'll see how that goes

Greg,so i couldn've looked like a god
Greg,paint
Greg,OMG HE WAS RIGHT
Greg,WHAT THE FUCK
Greg,Lmao lucky
Greg,"Kameron you literally said ""hard reads"" that's the worst possible way to get people to trust you lmao"
Greg,also you trusted smithy super hard and he was involved in every facist
Greg,Kameron that was so terrible stop this
Greg,you dont usually play this game straightfoward lmao
Greg,Kameron you threw
Greg,Eventually though if you play with enough people your goal is to categorize unknown players with know playstyles so saying you need to anticipate plaing with different people is a weak argument

Greg,@everyone It is possible that I have the flu and if I do I may be banished from the computer room although I do have discord on my Ipad. Just a heads up.
Greg,Why banished though?
Greg,so I don't get Ava sick
Greg,tell Ava to get bent
Greg,pull rank on her
Greg,you were there first
Greg,wait you are older right?
Greg,Ava and I hold the opinion that the sick person should concede their rights to the well person
Greg,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring
Greg,we have agreed on this in the past
Greg,I must honor my agreement
Greg,fair enough
Greg,Are you one of those older child supremacists?
Greg,are there any non-first-born older child supremacists?
Greg,just out of curiostiy
Greg,why not just not interact?
Greg,Doubtful
Greg,BECAUSE HE COUGHS IN THE AIR AND ITS
Greg,yes there are sylki
Greg,they are called the younger children
Greg,that's like being a black white supremicist
Greg,"Completely off topic, they are reverting the changes to Ana's heal grenade on the PTR"
Greg,boooooooooooooooooooooooo
Greg,And they are also removing the ability for Zen to apply discord orb through barriers
Greg,that kinda makes sense
Greg,nah im not an older child supremecist im actually the youngest in my family
Greg,i just run the house
Greg,then why did you need to mention that he is older?
Greg,cause he should pull rank on you
Greg,but he does not outrank me
Greg,"I made a youtube banner for my friends channel, any feedback or changes i should make before sending it to her?"
Greg,"nah, looks good"
Greg,"make sure the ""art and animation"" part has the same sized margins as the name"
Greg,cause right now they're tighter and it looks a bit odd
Greg,other than that it's lookin good
Greg,yeah thats my b I see it now too
Greg,also might want to make it not italicized
Greg,they were the same sized margins but then I made the aubtext italic so yeah forgot to account for that
Greg,it's up to you but I'm personally a fan of consistancy with this sort of thing so I'd keep it non-italic
Greg,well im using different fonts aswell for the titlw and subtext
Greg,im trying to break them up
Greg,I have no idea how it'd look but you might also want to try the same kind of text border thing you have going for hte main title on the subtitle
Greg,"different fonts works, but I prefer to keep them in a similar theme"
Greg,k thanks for the advice (not sarcasm)
Greg,"cause already you have different size, positioning, and font, adding the italics is just a tad too much imo"
Greg,"shrugs as always tho it's up to you, trust your own aesthetic sense"
Greg,@Sak von Sak skullgrills

Greg,"A student who was born female felt perfectly comfortable identifying as a man at Wellesley College — until people said he shouldn’t be class diversity officer because he is now a white male. Timothy Boatwright was born a girl, and checked off the “female” box when applying to the Massachusetts all-women’s school, according to an article in the New York Times. But when he got there, he introduced himself as a “masculine-of-center genderqueer” person named “Timothy” (the name he picked for himself) and asked ..."

Greg,becuase the only good player on that side of the bracket is the moon
Greg,and shroomed

Greg,cause I've been mostly watching sm4sh cause there's more strong players in the bracket

Greg,I don't know why he isn't
Greg,mango never went mario I'm pretty sure
Greg,prolly matchup familiarity?
Greg,like he's just more comfortable fox vs falcon
Greg,I don't think he's taken games with his sheik today
Greg,yes he has
Greg,"not sure tho, mostly been watching sm4sh"
Greg,he took 1 vs shroomed
Greg,and 1 vs hungry pidgeon
Greg,shrugs no idea then
Greg,whose your bet on the winner?
Greg,hbox of course
Greg,the safe pick
Greg,his only threat is m2k
Greg,no one else has even a small chance of beating him
Greg,hasn't m2k been beating hbox lately?
Greg,last set was summit where he lost
Greg,but prior to that was a local where they traded sets
Greg,could go either way
Greg,no player other than m2k can beat hbox
Greg,of moon and shroomed who do you think would do better if they make WF?
Greg,I think shroomed would have a better chance against both m2k and hbox
Greg,barring something insane (equivilant to that random wizzy over hbox) you're right
Greg,but I'm just gonna sit here and hope for more upsets
Greg,wizzy did it twice actually
Greg,once was vs a broken finger hbox though
Greg,I thought Armada was the best tho
Greg,"I woulnd't be super surprised if there were more upsets, it's been a fairly upset heavy tourney, in both games"
Greg,armada's not in the bracket
Greg,armada isn't attending

Greg,"Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world. Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves. All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people.

- George Bernard Shaw"
Greg,"Just playing devils advocate, based on his statement, stability and not being an asshole are the sole domain of the reasonable"
Greg,Which makes this a shaky argument for the unreasonable unless he enforced the importance of both
Greg,And you just didn't include the whole quote
Greg,"I think what is meant by this is that the people who ask ""so why isn't that possible"" are the unreasonable people because most people just accept it can't be done"
Greg,that is all of the quote I was given
Greg,if there is more that is my schools fault for not including the rest
Greg,Fair enough
Greg,I took it as a quote encouraging innovation and asking questions
Greg,which is something I appreciate
Greg,Based on the adapt to the world/adapt the world phrasing I think my point about the importance of both stands
Greg,I don't believe there is more to the quote
Greg,Adapting the world to you is the same as creating things to make your life easier
Greg,like making AC
Greg,the world is now whatever temperature I want
Greg,boom
Greg,Because if everyone tried to change the world to suit them we'd have a mess if t weren't for those who adapt to maintain it
Greg,world adapted
Greg,that is why most people are born with no sense of doing and are lazy
Greg,almost no one actually cares
Greg,Symbiotic n stuff
Greg,those who adapt to the world are mere followers
Greg,they can never make a difference
Greg,See a lot of you guys are very ambitious and want to have a huge impact with your job
Greg,Whereas all I really want is to get a good blue collar job
Greg,Not some field where I am a pioneer and I have to create and research new things
Greg,to each their own
Greg,"I'm not attacking the ones who make a difference, I'm just saying that both types are needed for those differences to become a part of a stable society"
Greg,You can't lead if everyone is a leader
Greg,true
Greg,I can lead but honestly I'd rather have my job clearly set out for me
Greg,but I believe that people are born in a proportion to what is needed by intelligent design
Greg,I get the work done and go home
Greg,"I'm reminded of a school trip I took back in middle school, at one point we had a motivational speaker talking to us, and he did a little ""repeat after me"" thing, going through stuff like ""I will live my life to its fullest"", ""I won't back down from a challenge"", etc, but then at one point he goes ""I will lead not follow"" and the whole room repeats this, with me and a friend just silently looking at each other and trying not to crack up"
Greg,"Most people are content as or would rather be followers, even if they'd say otherwise if you asked them"
Greg,that is accurate
Greg,see opinion above
Greg,"This was mostly in agreement with that (not a personal believer in intelligent design, but with the rest of it)"
Greg,"Personally, if the person I'm following is doing a better job than I could I'm fine not being in charge but if not Ill usually take charge"
Greg,The only issue with being a follower is making sure you are following the right leadee
Greg,"Which was a bitch for group projects in high school, where in my friend group I was at the top end of the bottom half, in terms of organization/leadership ability, so I'd always get stuck wrangling my super lazy/disorganized friends"
Greg,Sounds like every group project I've been in 
Greg,never done a group project but they sound horrible
Greg,They are
Greg,"Or consider our old tf2 team, where I main called for most of it just because I had more experience than you guys, despite not being a particularly great main caller and much preferring to manage a smaller chunk of the team (as roamer or scout I normally micromanage the flank, or as med usually just the combo) and let someone else handle the main strats"
Greg,us people who actually care get killed by those who are okay with a C
Greg,Any decent teacher groups you with people at your grade level or lets you choose your own groups
Greg,And the rare group projects with a good group are glorious
Greg,It's so dumb cause most teachers at my school assign groups
Greg,"One history project though I got the best group ever, like they were down to work on it outside of school and we ended up getting a 100% on it"
Greg,"Also, as a brief aside, some people who are happy with a C care quite a bit but just aren't equipped to do better (and yes they still drag you down but not for lack of caring)"
Greg,@Sak von Sak I invented a new melee crew battle format
Greg,it involves two teams of 6
Greg,and all the characters
Greg,in some way
Greg,"there's a guy in the kingston sm4sh discord whose current name is ""Darwid, Guac Master"""
Greg,what is that?

Greg,I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IT IS

Greg,that means you are on the road to adulthood
Greg,it's basically just that I ate lunch at 4 and I've been snacking all day so I'm completely not hungry
Greg,and as a result don't have the energy for actual food
Greg,Poor Sylki and his poptarts
Greg,what flavor poptarts though
Greg,asking the real questions

Greg,"lololololol apparently our premier (the person in charge of provincial-level governemtn, don't know what the US equivilant would be, governer maybe?) only has a 12% approval rating"
Greg,lol what a loser
Greg,Bush had a higher approval rating than that
Greg,"and I don't even know what she did wrong, I've heard of no controversial bills, no scandals, no one expressing a particular dislike, nothing"
Greg,fake news?
Greg,but clearly something has gone horribly wrong
Greg,maybe she isn't disliked that much
Greg,"I'm assuming that yeah, she's not the target of strong dislike, just not many people particularly like her"
Greg,alternatively since it's provincial level I just haven't heard much cause it's smaller scale
Greg,but DAMN 12% approval rating is awful
Greg,What's her name?
Greg,kathleen wynne
Greg,or something like that
Greg,dunno exact spelling

Greg,there are big melee tourneys this weekend
Greg,but nope he's going to a sm4sh tournament
Greg,he just got basically jv3'd by a top 20 player
Greg,he only technically didn't jv3 him cause he took 1 damage from being too far offscreen while killing bizz
Greg,does he play ganon?
Greg,of course he does

Greg,edgy long hair swordsmen?
Greg,i'd believe it
Greg,somehow neither of them is edgy in game
Greg,boi dunban is extra edgy
Greg,hello???
Greg,how is he edgy?
Greg,other than that he's metal af
Greg,err sorry not dunban i'm dumb
Greg,the other one is edgy
Greg,I mean I only just met him
Greg,he doesn't seem that edgy
Greg,dunban is not that edgy in fairness
Greg,oh oops no spoiling then
Greg,uh oh
Greg,suddenly very worried
Greg,ts nothing major just he becomes more edgy later on
Greg,aight
Greg,dunban is super metal tho
Greg,at least at the start
Greg,oh yeah totally
Greg,but he becomes less edgy as it goes on
Greg,"man burns out all the nerves in one arm fighting the good fight, waits a year, then comes right back in fighting with the other arm and giving zero fucks"
Greg,man runs straight down a cliff
Greg,yeah and then it turns out he's the mentor character like
Greg,
Greg,yup
Greg,the other dude (lao?) is kinda like the opposite
Greg,@Zain what was network id and passowrd
Greg,starts out chill and develops the badass/edgy-ness?
Greg,yeah basically
Greg,lao's got nuts dps
Greg,also true
Greg,"for a sniper dude who keeps going ""it's not my forte, but..."" every time I go for melee combos he's got some damn good melee arts"
Greg,and that one art that buffs everyone's ranged stuff is so good
Greg,especially when my main character does giant laser beams
Greg,yeah lao is super good at the point where you first get to use him
Greg,its been to fucking long since i played x tho liek actually
Greg,I just got it a few days ago
Greg,thus far loving it
Greg,i played it on release which was like a few years ago i think
Greg,yeah I was hoping the price would go down before I got it
Greg,its a great game tho
Greg,ran out of patience
Greg,oh unlucky
Greg,Lin is such a good character
Greg,shame her design is super uncanny valley and all
Greg,just remember she's 13
Greg,"""13"""
Greg,yeah I know
Greg,I'm not saying she's attractive
Greg,she's just really funny
Greg,no i'm just making fun of the super young tech nerd cliche but she's a well developed character
Greg,and she's also funny which is nice
Greg,there's something just.... off... about her model
Greg,it's super unsettling and I can't put my finger on it
Greg,she has bug eyes curved downward which make her look a little off sometimes
Greg,that might be it
Greg,the characters have fairly normal eyes but lin has really big eyes in comparison
Greg,I mean I gave my character purple and teal cat eyes and it's somehow less unsettling
Greg,(also don't ask how purple and teal work together but somehow they do)
Greg,idk mans
Greg,Still the greatest sin this game has is not allowing us to play as Tatsu
Greg,noooo tatsu's annoying
Greg,never been a fan of the nopon
Greg,we need to successor to the heropon
Greg,didn't really like riki either
Greg,riki was hype
Greg,he's comic relief and occasional emotional crutch for melia and beyond that he serves no purpose
Greg,reyn and riki together made it much better
Greg,and he's not even a good party member
Greg,Wait that's actually not true riki is easily one of the better ones
Greg,really? I never figured out how to make him any good
Greg,he's a magic tank and he's got like half the statuses
Greg,yeah but he can't draw aggro
Greg,so being a tank is useless
Greg,he focuses on statusing
Greg,statuses draw aggro i believe
Greg,moreso than big damage
Greg,I could never get him to hold aggro
Greg,dunno
Greg,its nbd unless you're going for like max difficulty runs or something
Greg,shrugs he never did any work for me
Greg,best party for me was dunban fiora sharla
Greg,mad jukes and on the offchance you get hit sharla's got your back
Greg,yeah
Greg,dunban fiora melia is good for most of the game up until you start hitting frequent enemies with strong AoE that just kills melia without her even having aggro
Greg,i kinda gave up on sharla because overheating is a terrible mechanic
Greg,just never play as sharla and you won't notice
Greg,no i notices because she just doesnt do anything
Greg,and she eventually gets a skill that halves the time it takes
Greg,yeah but by then i could just use melia
Greg,eh she just has less overall healing
Greg,yeah but she's got more than enough damage to make up for it
Greg,and in the late game stuff gets AoE that can one shot her without her having aggro and without getting a vision
Greg,and then once you revive her it takes ages to get heals back up properly
Greg,reyn melia shulk/dunban is  how i went most of the game
Greg,yeah that's true
Greg,how on earth did you run reyn melia? melia never seems to give enough heals to sustain him at all
Greg,if the enemies were being aoe happy i'd just play her and play super conservatively
Greg,also can we talk about how shit melia's AI is?
Greg,absolutely
Greg,its terrible
Greg,"if you've got melia in the party, you play melia"
Greg,also sustaining reyn wasn't that bad
Greg,skyfactoryfb
Greg,what elementals did you use?
Greg,"melia had slow heals but she did work, and whenever i ran shulk we had monado shield and stuff too"
Greg,I mean melia's great for 4/5 of the time she's in the party
Greg,I hoenstly don't even remember its been way too longs since I played chronicles
Greg,actually what i think i did was
Greg,i'd healing gift and then hide int he back with water elemental
Greg,and then just try and pooke with fire and electric
Greg,huh I did basically the same
Greg,but it seemed like healing gift couldn't really keep up
Greg,yeah sometimes reyn would get low so i'd have to burn a water discharge
Greg,it seemed like the main issue was just the cooldown
Greg,shrugs
Greg,melia dunban was nuts tho
Greg,i dont remember the specifics my last full playthrough of chronicles was easily over three years ago
Greg,especially if you did water+lightning+wind and he just gets even more agility
Greg,dunban made me feel guilty using him lmao
Greg,he's so good

Greg,2GGaming Playing Super Smash Bros. for Wii U - Twitch Clips
Greg,2GGC: Civil War - Climax - Clipped by Booyahman
Greg,doesn't show the end of the match but it was just a random bair at like 140
Greg,isn't samus bad?
Greg,yeah
Greg,also doesn't esam play pikachu?
Greg,but pika mario is apparently one of the worst high tier matchups in the game
Greg,"the terrible high tier mus are diddy > ryu, mario > pika, um"
Greg,apparently meta knight > rosa but I have no idea why
Greg,this would be like a hype mango vs armada themed tournament and hbox just wins
Greg,rosa > ness might be the worst matchup in any smash game
Greg,"this would be like, if at G3 mango went out to like abate and armada lost to like.... scar"
Greg,wow that extreme?
Greg,I have never heard of the guy who knocked zero out
Greg,then again he made top 96 so maybe a bit better
Greg,it'd be like if armada lost to trillium
Greg,or homemadewaffles
Greg,that would be super funny
Greg,the quivilant for armada to lose to like melee esam and then trillium
Greg,and then for mango to lose to like mafia and abate
Greg,who was ally's first loss?
Greg,trela
Greg,he's somewhere in the 40s I think
Greg,character?
Greg,ryu
Greg,oh actually he's 25th
Greg,what
Greg,oh it's almost a year outdated
Greg,was looking at the older rankings
Greg,trela's 42nd
Greg,"so if I'm gonna follow exact rankings, mang0 lost to Abu and Dizzkidboogie playing dk"
Greg,"actually going by position in the tier list, dkb's zelda"
Greg,and neither of the people zero lost to are ranked so I dunno how to compare it
Greg,there's also a link guarunteed at least 9th
Greg,that's the equivilant of a DK being guarunteed 9th at the most stacked melee tournament you've ever seen

Greg,this falcon player is by far the most fun to watch player I've ever seen in smash 4
Greg,dunno why they're outside
Greg,but yeah fatality's a crowd favourite for a reason
Greg,these are my two favourite players
Greg,I still want nairo to win tho
Greg,also if you missed the end of game two https://clips.twitch.tv/CrypticPreciousWatermelonChocolateRain

Greg,wow 3-0 comeback
Greg,hooooooly shit
Greg,fatality is soooo nuts
Greg,that pop off too
Greg,he's so hyped
Greg,that set was insane
Greg,that might have been the best set I've seen all year
Greg,that was also a really short set
Greg,is smash 4 usually that fast?
Greg,like games end quickly
Greg,nope
Greg,that's basically the peak of aggro play in sm4sh
Greg,if only the whole game was like that
Greg,"fastest players you're likely to see are nairo, fatality, SuperGirlKels (tho she's lower level), esam's pika, larry lurr"
Greg,also marss
Greg,forgot about marss
Greg,what about hax
Greg,sm4sh
Greg,not melee
Greg,only problem with fatality is he's really bad at slowing it down when he needs to
Greg,even if someone's doing a great job walling him out he'll keep bashing his head against it
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,I found the mythical 8
Greg,woah
Greg,"commentators currently discussing whether to call the mewtwo combo abandango invented ""The Aba-combo"" or ""The Combo-dango"""
Greg,aba combo is better
Greg,^
Greg,I'm partial to the combo-dango
Greg,that one kinda sounds inappropriate
Greg,so?
Greg,it's so much more fun to say
Greg,esports needs to be esports
Greg,aba-combo is easier to say
Greg,"various sm4sh combos are commonly called ""The hoo-hah"", ""The ding-dong"", ""The beep-boop"", etc."
Greg,"I agree, and it sounds better"
Greg,aba-combo
Greg,we don't do legit sounding names of things
Greg,"I'm not sure if you guys have heard how abadango is pronounced, but the dango part sounds pretty similar to combo"
Greg,it basically ends up sounding like combo-dongo
Greg,which is why it's easy to replace dango with combo
Greg,shrugs
Greg,still more fun to say
Greg,but I'll agree to disagree
Greg,also I kinda just hate you so you know
Greg,kinda have to disagree
Greg,
Greg,DK IN TOP 8
Greg,another top 10 player out
Greg,7/10 have been eliminated
Greg,"only one in top 8 thus far, two of them are in losers"
Greg,wow
Greg,I was watching the DK set
Greg,DK's duuuuumb
Greg,that MU looks brutal tho
Greg,cause sheik has such a hard time killing
Greg,and DK's so heavy and he's never gonna let her get rage
Greg,I don't think mr r got over 100% that whole set
Greg,if you're still watching witness my least favourite character
Greg,fuck ryu
Greg,why?
Greg,"man has a kill confirm at like 65-90 (rage dependant) off uptilt or downtilt, both of which are somewhere between frame 1-3"
Greg,plus it's safe on shield
Greg,and he's super heavy so he always gets a ton of rage
Greg,he has a fast shield breaker so you can't just shield
Greg,on bigger characters (like ROB) he can nairplane you across the stage into a spike
Greg,he has a cancellable super-armour move
Greg,that is also a free setup into his best kill move (aka you die at like 65 if he's got rage)
Greg,rob even has a decent matchup against ryu (pretty close to 50/50 imo) but he's just such a pain to fight against
Greg,"cause ryu has trouble approaching through projectiles, but he touches you and you're boned"
Greg,nairo why would you go to T&C and give ryu a lower cieling
Greg,you have to play so campy against ryu and it's so boring and also terrifying
Greg,noooooo fuck ryu
Greg,8/10 of the top ten eliminated before top 8
Greg,"silver lining, canada made top 8"
Greg,but ugh fuck ryu
Greg,9/10
Greg,9/10 of the top ten out before top eight
Greg,what the hell
Greg,4/5 of the top 5 out
Greg,jesus christ
Greg,who is the one still in?
Greg,dabuz
Greg,#4
Greg,My personal pick for who I want to win is captain zack because bayo is super cool
Greg,or fatality
Greg,hhahahaha clearly you've never fought a bayo
Greg,no I never play this game
Greg,yeah I know
Greg,cool to watch
Greg,like falco
Greg,falco is super bad in smash 4
Greg,too bad
Greg,I'm cheering for fatality or marss
Greg,"safe money is on dabuz, kirihara, or captain zack"
Greg,"but then again, safe bets have very much not prevailed this tournament"
Greg,at the same time it'd be so sick to see T or Hikaru win for the low tiers
Greg,it'd be like DK or Yoshi winning evo for melee
Greg,are they in the same approximate place on the tier list or same level of viability because I don't think that those two things are equal comparing smash 4 and melee
Greg,approximate tier list placement
Greg,basically just did ((sm4sh tier list placement) / (number of characters in sm4sh)) * (number of characters in melee) and rounded it
Greg,but honestly in terms of viability it wouldn't be much different
Greg,then again I guess you could argue that this shakes things up (ie if they're making top 8 clearly they're underrated on the tier list and in general considerations of their viability)
Greg,"to summarize, you see why I don't feel like I'm handicapping myself by playing 33rd on the tier list?"
Greg,"I made it on one team, but I have another tryout later"
Greg,gg
Greg,where is my mans @Mr. Airplane
Greg,@Max if you're not still watching we're in top 8
Greg,I'm watching
Greg,what is it with japanese players and covering their faces?
Greg,it's a thing you do when you're sick
Greg,yeah
Greg,kids at my school do it
Greg,thats nice
Greg,"or if people aroudn you are, and I'm assuming they're all mostly staying together so if one of them's sick they're all gonna cover up"
Greg,well the ones from most Asain countries that is
Greg,also captain zack's american
Greg,oh really?
Greg,rip i wanted to watch top 8
Greg,just physicall y janapense
Greg,but now I have csgo stuff
Greg,"even though I'm not a fan of bayo, I'm still cheering for captain zack cause I really want to see someone who's never won a major win the most stacked sm4sh tourney to date"
Greg,I don't like bayo either
Greg,so unless they fight each other I'm cheering against dabuz and kirihara
Greg,that combo was lit though
Greg,yeah
Greg,I'm a little behind you
Greg,should be caught up now
Greg,what character is that little doll that dabuz has with him?
Greg,I don't like bayo but I do like the way captain zack plays
Greg,I missed it I dunno
Greg,description?
Greg,pink hair yellow and black outfit
Greg,it will probably show up again
Greg,shrugs I'll keep an eye out
Greg,same color scheme as his rosa skin
Greg,but with pink hair?
Greg,yeah
Greg,no idea what the doll is
Greg,dabuz has the freest bracket tho
Greg,he's basically guarunteed 2nd
Greg,I wonder if links super lame style or falcons super fast style will be the dominant style of this match
Greg,T's actually pretty aggro for a link
Greg,but that's till not that aggro
Greg,my guess is that Link's gonna dictate the pace just cause it's Fatality
Greg,man has no chill
Greg,but it might not matter
Greg,we shall see
Greg,see? link's not that lame
Greg,I used to play a lot of link
Greg,wouldn't mind seeing him win
Greg,I'm still cheering for fatality
Greg,even if T might be better against dabuz
Greg,cause a) fatality's awesome and b) rosa link would be soooo slow
Greg,do bombs have kill potential?
Greg,sort of
Greg,bombs themselves don't kill
Greg,but they can set up into kills
Greg,T's nuts
Greg,T's nuts
Greg,fucking insane
Greg,true
Greg,what % chance would you give him vs dabuz?
Greg,I have no idea what the matchup's like
Greg,hm
Greg,70-30 in dabuz's favour
Greg,maybe 65-35
Greg,"I can see the sword being able to contest rosa's range, but then also link can't cover his landings with dair cause rosa's up air is so disjoined"
Greg,I wonder if bombs on shield will mess with luma
Greg,I honestly have no idea how the matchup's gonna go
Greg,the more I think the better it seems for T
Greg,"dabuz is a studier and a learner, and I'm gonna assume he didn't really look at T or Link"
Greg,I'm gonna end at 60-40 dabuz
Greg,my god zack what was that combo
Greg,that was disgusting
Greg,and why are you surprised they ranked this character first?
Greg,yes
Greg,due to the lack of results
Greg,I don't think it's reasonable to say someone's the best character when none of the best players play them
Greg,think about the last 2 years of melee. the top fox placing in a tournament is usually 2nd or 3rd while peach's is 1st and fox is still ranked 5 places higher
Greg,and she may have mad punishes but she loses some pretty key matchups and can struggle to approach (did you see how much trouble he was having getting anything started on dabuz)
Greg,I'm not saying you should do it purely by player ranking
Greg,but it's definately a way to get a partial judgement
Greg,"the fact that there's only one puff and one peach in the top 20 or so (I forget where macD is, possibly top 30) should tell you that they aren't as good as their best players make them look"
Greg,whereas there's a ton of fox
Greg,or the characters are seen as boring by the general public so the people attempting to play them are much fewer in number
Greg,which is actually true
Greg,if you look at the distribution of mains
Greg,oh my goodness the disrespect
Greg,CZ gives no fucks about his opponants' feelings
Greg,zero fucks whatsoever
Greg,I missed it what happened?
Greg,"taunted in game, taunted in real life"
Greg,he's taunted so many times
Greg,fthrow taunt is a true combo
Greg,is her taunt an attack?
Greg,no
Greg,he just throws people and then taunts
Greg,let's goooo fatality
Greg,that was probably a hype set too bad I missed it
Greg,I saw the final kill
Greg,and thats it
Greg,fatality's nuts
Greg,kirihara almost reverse 3-0'd him
Greg,and then fatality turned up out of nowhere in the last 30 seconds or so
Greg,@everyone anyone want to play secret hitler tonight
Greg,maybe
Greg,depends how long this tourney goes
Greg,cause this might be the hypest sm4sh tourney I've ever seen
Greg,I agree with that because I find it interesting and i usually don't care to watch smash 4
Greg,a lot of unexpected aggro players doing really well
Greg,I'm hoping the meta evolves this way in the future
Greg,so apparently T has beaten kirihara (the other best rosa) so he might have a chance here
Greg,how much money does the winner get?
Greg,not sure
Greg,not something I really pay attention to
Greg,did you see how much shield damage that fair did? that's like half the shield
Greg,"on an unrelated note, kingston sm4sh discord has seen the return of our most cancerous community member"
Greg,haven't seen him since last year
Greg,the most toxic person I've ever talked to
Greg,the guy who basically stole from me
Greg,"he hosted a tourney at his house, I knocked him out at 4th, got 3rd, he declared only top 2 get money, then on the drive home (with 1st and 2nd) they counted their money and there a chunk missing"
Greg,and now he's back and already trying to start shit
Greg,just kick him from the discord then
Greg,if everyone agrees he is toxic
Greg,except not everyone does
Greg,and he's surprisingly good friends with one of our community leaders
Greg,and the guy who owns the discord
Greg,also I don't want to start shit with him
Greg,and there are even people who argue that the trash talk and stuff is good for the community
Greg,"""your popoff sucks"""
Greg,from the crowd
Greg,lololol
Greg,everyone hates dabuz for some reason
Greg,I love kingston sm4sh discord tho
Greg,"one guy (actually the melee zelda main) comments that, while he doesn't have a winning record against a lot of people, he couldn't think of anyone in the discord that he hasn't beaten"
Greg,then out of nowhere
Greg,"top player in ottawa shows up like ""yo what up?"" and has apparently been here for like half an hour just watching the conversation"
Greg,top tier lurking
Greg,what I want to see more than almost anything right now is fatality to 3-0 zack then give him the irl show me your moves
Greg,but I don't think he's that mean
Greg,let's gooooo fatality
Greg,that was crazy good
Greg,fatality's nuts
Greg,you almost got to see the fatality combo but T was juuuuust too low percent
Greg,that stomp footstool stomp footstool thing?
Greg,yes
Greg,so good
Greg,fatality in grands let's gooooooo
Greg,if he wins that would be so hype
Greg,he could do it
Greg,hard but doable
Greg,this guy makes smash 4 interesting to watch
Greg,these commentators are too loud
Greg,DMs ARE A THING
Greg,USE THEM
Greg,there used to be three of us watching
Greg,sorry
Greg,@here overwatch?
Greg,@Max almost done with tourney?
Greg,possibly
Greg,could be anywhere from one to seven more games
Greg,*one to eight
Greg,no one to seven
Greg,I have not finished my placements
Greg,I'm bad at math
Greg,can't play comp with you
Greg,booooo
Greg,fatality lost
Greg,it was so close but that early kill in the last game ate all his momentum
Greg,still crazy that he got 2nd
Greg,who won the whole thing?
Greg,dabuz
Greg,ah
Greg,"I am 57,358 of all faceit users"
Greg,"out of the 200,000 some that play"
Greg,VP just went 2-13 at half to overtime now
Greg,what map?
Greg,train
Greg,isn't train pretty one sided? didn't we do a similar thing the one time we played train?
Greg,eh it can be
Greg,where we got destroyed CT and then did pretty well on T?
Greg,but still
Greg,13-2
Greg,still impressive
Greg,both teams destroyed ct side though
Greg,shrugs
Greg,and they won

Greg,Competitive overwatch: episode 1
Greg,so apparently back in the '90s my university's student government had a 3-hour debate on whether or not to approve a campus Star Trek club because their constitution had a policy banning Klingons from being club members which the student government thought failed to promote equality
Greg,wat
Greg,http://kingstonherald.com/news/klingon-equity-queens-university-2010310319
Greg,"Klingon ""Equity"" Cited in Free Speech Grade for Queen's Universi..."
Greg,"AMS ""Student Union actions & practices"" gets a B in national report"
Greg,and yes that is a picture of a klingon photoshopped onto a picture of part of our campus
Greg,@Sak von Sak Thats super dumb
Greg,who cares
Greg,that's a good question
Greg,really funny tho
Greg,yeah
Greg,also proof that it's not just millenials who do weird things in the name of equality
Greg,in your country it started much earlier
Greg,oh don't give me that
Greg,I'm sure if you dug around the states you'd find stuff
Greg,yes
Greg,but you guys have been more progressive from farther back in time
Greg,"yeah, but I don't really qualify this as ""progressive"""
Greg,"more as ""slightly insane"""
Greg,its progressivism taken too far
Greg,although from the article I gather the issue was more about that other actually exclusive clubs could crop up using this as a precedent
Greg,oh that makes sense
Greg,"I mean I feel like it'd be pretty easy to make an argument against that working (""banning a fictional group is very different than banning an actual one, doesn't count as a precedent"") but at this level stuff like this has some legal standing so I can understand the caution and not wanting to have to have that argument"
Greg,My mic wasn't working
Greg,I'm pretty sure sm4sh wario mains have some of the best tags around
Greg,when I was in quebec over the summer there was a guy whose tag was WAHrrior and apparently there's some guy whose tag is EnigWAH
Greg,r/place has ended ;-;
Greg,"so I had this bright idea that cause I'm feeling pretty stressed I'm gonna work while listening to the upbeat/relaxing chunks of the chrono cross ost, and now I'm stuck cause I really just want to go play chrono cross and if there's one thing I really don't have time for it's a ~60 hour rpg"

Greg,it's actually not as bad as I'm making it sound
Greg,I just got called the king of organic chemistry by my teacher
Greg,my part of the term project is done and the course with the assignment I'm donig well enough that I can just not do this assignment and focus on the test (which is worth a much larger chunk of my mark for that course)
Greg,"and then I just have two more assignments, a test, and exams (one of which I'm horribly behind in the class and I'm gonna have to go in for a ton of help, but I've got time)"

Greg,@Bitmin
Greg,Anyone wanna play RoA?
Greg,@here

Greg,New update and I'm stuck on vacation FEELSGREATMAN
Greg,oh no the horror of being stuck in california on vacation
Greg,I feel so bad for you
Greg,Thanks me too
Greg,it's the first week since november that we've had decent weather and I'm too busy to go out and enjoy it
Greg,glances outside oh hey it's started raining maybe being in here's not so bad
Greg,@here how's the new update?
Greg,its too cool for you
Greg,I'm too cool for this update
Greg,its pretty lit
Greg,the uprising event takes a while tho
Greg,I'm so bummed out rn
Greg,don't be
Greg,like its just a few cool skins
Greg,and new lore stuff
Greg,I don't like going on vacation
Greg,^
Greg,like just over a 100 pieces of new content
Greg,it's boring
Greg,honestly
Greg,Vacations are exhausting
Greg,vacations are supposed to be relaxing are u ok
Greg,Home is relaxing
Greg,@Mr. Airplane games are relaxing
Greg,@bois
Greg,@Max
Greg,lets play the new update
Greg,@Feral Nebula
Greg,"@Mr. Airplane I started learning C#, very interesting!!!"
Greg,if you want to play join a channel
Greg,@Trapezoider
Greg,I don't know C# at all @Trapezoider
Greg,@Mr. Airplane Rip dweeb
Greg,wait where did everyone go
Greg,@Zain
Greg,What is everyone doing in here? @here
Greg,nothing really
Greg,just playing the new update
Greg,Am sad
Greg,yuuuuus my linalg prof is so good
Greg,he just put up what every single question on the exam is going to be (not the specific numbers and graphs but what they're gonna be)
Greg,this is so helpful
Greg,linalg?
Greg,Good guy professor
Greg,linear algebra
Greg,super neat math stuff
Greg,Today Ava and trap are going to play a best of 5 rivals set to see who is better
Greg,ooh ooh tell me before it happens I want to watch
Greg,Gg
Greg,alright
Greg,I swear the math profs at queens are all so good
Greg,"best profs I've had these two years have been differential+integral calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math (only in second year, first year discrete math the prof was pretty bad)"
Greg,so math profs are pretty good then I guess
Greg,it's a pretty well funded department cause it overlaps with so many other ones so I assume they can afford really good ones
Greg,"but they're all really good at explaining stuff, have tons of office hours if you need to go in for help, do extra help stuff for tests and exams, have really comprehensive online resources, etc etc etc"
Greg,and as good as it is I kinda wish the prof quality was spread a little more evenly cause some profs suuuuuuck
Greg,possibly the most frustrating is this one guy who's a top guy in his field (his field is pretty specific) but he just can't teach it for shit
Greg,sad
Greg,If anyone was wondering
Greg,
Greg,ABSA IS BAD !?
Greg,Every character is close I just think absa is the worst
Greg,still totally viable
Greg,loud crying
Greg,just my opinion
Greg,others may say different
Greg,me being wrastor may influence that
Greg,YEAH YA THINK?
Greg,also we need to do the maypul vs orcane cuteness poll

Greg,"XD If you have fun with it, get good and be the best"
Greg,"Welp I opened the door to my bathroom and a fucking two and a half inch long centipede comes zooming out, I actually almost pissed myself and may have woken up all my housemates"
Greg,Also I have an exam in five and a half hours and I'm wide awake
Greg,

Greg,Oops
Greg,Anything can mean anything if you say it loud enough
Greg,Truw
Greg,FREEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOM

Greg,this latop wasn't cheap either
Greg,and it only lasted 2 years
Greg,that sucks
Greg,sadbois
Greg,  
Greg,@Sak von Sak I learned a shadow combo
Greg,nice nice
Greg,need to make sure I can do it both ways now
Greg,as in both directions
Greg,yeah that's always important
Greg,Good I can
Greg,Fight?
Greg,working on packing and cleaning right now
Greg,maybe later tonight
Greg,okay
Greg,Random question
Greg,http://www.strawpoll.me/12830647
Greg,Which would you rather have control the world?
Greg,Vote Now! [Nazi Germany] [Communist USSR] 
Greg,"I mean, seeing as I'm jewish this is a pretty easy question"
Greg,I'm assuming that very few of us are jews but for you yes its a no brainer
Greg,@Mr. Airplane @waowder wanna do some lockeed practice at around 8:30ish
Greg,@Rotomotorz  im down
Greg,sure
Greg,@waowder
Greg,yo
Greg,http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Codequest+2016+problems
Greg,LMGTFY
Greg,"so I'm skimming parts of the xenoblade x soundtrack, there is a song that is actually just called ""z37b20a13t01t08le"""
Greg,What???
Greg,I HAVE NO IDEA
Greg,by the way new sg character should be fully practiced and ready in a few days
Greg,nice nice
Greg,you're probably gonna surpass me soon
Greg,nah
Greg,I don't have any characters that are actually good other than double
Greg,I thought ms fortune was a good character
Greg,I'm not good with her tho
Greg,oh I see
Greg,also airdash cancling is super easy
Greg,grumbles
Greg,you made it sound impossible
Greg,I don't have the fast hands for it
Greg,you just input a ground dash
Greg,or I'm just doing something wrong mentally
Greg,in the air
Greg,tap foward twice
Greg,then do a move
Greg,yes but I can never seem to do it fast enough for the combo to keep going
Greg,"maybe it's a tighter window on fortune than whoever you're learning (if it's not fortune I'd assume filia, but if it's fortune then I just don't have the hands for it)"
Greg,maybe
Greg,I'll have to try whatever combo your doing and see
Greg,"I'm probably gonna drop fortune, focus on the parasoul (sure her combo's hard but I think with a bit more practice I'll be able to get it) plus I'm way more comfortable with her neutral and openers"
Greg,I do not like fighting characters that outrange me by a significant degree
Greg,this is why I need big band
Greg,she's basically marth with samus missiles
Greg,it's great
Greg,so dumb
Greg,I did a thing
Greg,
Greg,I am a totally different person without hair and it's kind of scary
Greg,So did i
Greg,lol what is that?
Greg,Getting stitches soon
Greg,No games 4 me
Greg,ouch
Greg,Yup
Greg,wait what happened @Jed
Greg,Was working on a model rocket and xacto knife slipped
Greg,I cut pretty deep
Greg,It was a new blade though so that's nice
Greg,yay for not getting tetanus
Greg,although an old one might not have cut as deep
Greg,Yeah
Greg,rip octagon
Greg,also wow I never knew what Sylki looked like
Greg,Yeet
Greg,"Most of my pc parts have been delivered, I'm just waiting on my case and operating system"
Greg,"In case anyone was wondering/cared, which, no-one does..."
Greg,why u throwing urself a pity party there
Greg,@Mr. Airplane
Greg,Are you prepared to build it
Greg,The first one is always scary D:
Greg,DONT WORK  ON CARPET DO IT ON A COUNTER
Greg,MAKE SURE TO TOUCH THE CASE A LOT TO AVOID STATIC FRYING TF OUT OF YOUR MOTHER BOARD
Greg,just use a static grounding glove its not that bad
Greg,But thats an extra thing to buy and is annoying
Greg,Not really?
Greg,subjective.org
Greg,already bought one gottem
Greg,Nice job kameron
Greg,zz
Greg,good luck with the PC at least you were gone during my finals week
Greg,quick what game are you playin rn
Greg,wait actually that was so perfectly timed
Greg,this is simulator simulator
Greg,renamed it
Greg,your card-game?
Greg,Kameron is forced to study for his exams in Junior year how about that
Greg,its as if Kameron was blessed by the gods
Greg,yeah whenever I'm playing nothing it will now say I'm playing my card game instead of simulator simulator

Greg,this is most certianly false
Greg,lies
Greg,this should.... probably be in the memes channel
Greg,you think this is a meme?
Greg,the probably is there because I'm not sure I wanted to read that regardless of where it was
Greg,triggered
Greg,LOL
Greg,is Sylki offended
Greg,less by the content than the style and the intentional amount of cringe
Greg,he tried to take credit for writing that
Greg,I did?
Greg,no trap
Greg,I suck at green texts @Sak von Sak
Greg,The only one I tried to write go no comments on 4 chan
Greg,:[
Greg,you poor soul
Greg,Green texts = favorite memes though

Greg,memer
Greg,no
Greg,why dad
Greg,kys
Greg,it's fusion's server I think
Greg,aye
Greg,alright cool
Greg,I thought it was chikons
Greg,But then I realized he doesnt have the highest tier role
Greg,I think old frostbite was
Greg,also I'm pretty sure he's a master memer too
Greg,:[
Greg,also why do you want to be a master memer? what would you do with this untold power?
Greg,Nothing I just want to be up there with you guys
Greg,:[
Greg,the only thing I've used it for is to add the  emote
Greg,I would add a meme emote? and monitor the memes channel to ensure safety of users
Greg,what meme would you use to encapsulate the entirety of meme-hood?
Greg,Holy shit
Greg,P.E.P.E
Greg,actually
Greg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CekwfI7VL._SX300_QL70_.jpg

Greg,Praise his name forever on high
Greg,This is lord kek
Greg,THe mightiest of all memes
Greg,He only appears one in every 69^(infinity) memes
Greg,I'll reserve judgement and leave it up to fusion
Greg,@Zain
Greg,I am the highest tier memer here
Greg,"also I'm considering changing my tag for smash at least, should I go to Young Irish Stew or Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer?"
Greg,Can I have a role that shows up above master memers that has no powers but says master master memers
Greg,Y O U N G I R I S H S T E W
Greg,! ! !
Greg,@everyone I want an opinion
Greg,I like Young Irish Stew
Greg,Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer is a mouthful
Greg,^
Greg,Yung without an o
Greg,just for the meme
Greg,"if I do it like that I'd have to shorten every word a bit, I can't thing of a good way to shorten Irish and Stu will make people think that that's my name"
Greg,I guess I could do Yung Irish Stoo
Greg,but I don't think it's as good
Greg,The other name is longer though
Greg,How would you shorten it?
Greg,probably just to Lermon Squerzer
Greg,and the shortening of this one was to have consistency with Yung instead of Young
Greg,@Mr. Airplane are you done building your comp

Greg,"no dungeons, supid quest system, terrible story, no cool items, and way too much just wandering around trying to find your next objective"
Greg,I think they focused on the open world part way too much
Greg,YES
Greg,and there's a lot of random grinding for no reason
Greg,I hate the fact that it is non linear
Greg,it makes it hard to tell a good story and properly scale difficulty
Greg,I keep running into enemies that kill me in one hit
Greg,why
Greg,git gud solved yo problem
Greg,did you know that your opinion of open world games is negative does not mean the game is objectively bad
Greg,^
Greg,@Sak von Sak chill avec moi
Greg,Young Irish Stew is typing...
Greg,"For example, what you just described is part of what I like about xenoblade x - they tell you right out the gates that the world is incredibly hostile and you're constantly hearing about people getting attacked and killed by super strong monsters and then it happens to you and you're kinda like ""damn.  Fortunately unlike these sucker npcs I can revive at checkpoints"" and it adds to all the world building"
Greg,"Also I can't right now, maybe later tonight"

Greg,what
Greg,I need this next year
Greg,I don't remember exactly how it works but if you make an amazon account with a student email you can get free prime
Greg,OP
Greg,within canada at least
Greg,so if any of you non-uni kids in canada want to order stuff off amazon you can probably do it through me (although paying me back would be complicated)
Greg,"oh also of note, that free shipping is free ONE-DAY SHIPPING"
Greg,woah
Greg,Yeah just make an account with your student email
Greg,free for a whole year
Greg,pretty sure I've had it more than a year
Greg,really? mine ran out after a year

Greg,@Bitmin
Greg,"toronto weather has gone from ""comfortably cool in jeans and a sweatshirt"" to ""sweating in shorts and a tshirt"" overnight"
Greg,No kidding
Greg,I was dying yesterday
Greg,I was kinda hoping it'd be a one day thing but it seems like it's sticking around
Greg,I feel no sympathy it's hot here all the time
Greg,it's not so bad when you're used to it
Greg,if it was this hot during the summer we wouldn't be complaining
Greg,but it jumped twenty degrees celsius overnight and that's bullshit
Greg,Around here this is basically considered part of summer
Greg,We get summer weather from May to October
Greg,"in fahrenheit, it went from 50 to 86 overnight"
Greg,that's not ok
Greg,86 is comforable
Greg,I wish I had heat
Greg,Comfortable*
Greg,"86 is slightly too hot, but when you're not used to it it's brutal"
Greg,also it's super humid
Greg,Ideal to me is 78
Greg,What humidity number is it?
Greg,69%
Greg,It's even worse when your AC isn't on
Greg,ahahaha our AC's semi busted so it doesn't get everywhere in the house
Greg,Okay I feel sorry for you guys now no ac is rough
Greg,Rip
Greg,fans have become a crucial commodity
Greg,I'm so tired
Greg,I fell asleep at like 3 last night
Greg,So I drank a monster and i was good for a whilr
Greg,But now I am tired again
Greg,I'd say my perfect temperatures are 22 (72ish) or 13 (55ish) depending on what I'm doing
Greg,also ouch
Greg,just force yourself to stay up as long as you can
Greg,Monsters are death in a bottle I would advise against drinking them
Greg,Nah
Greg,eh energy drinks are only bad if you drink like 5
Greg,I mean I don't drink them every day
Greg,admittadly I've never had energy drinks but so long as you don't go crazy with how many you drink and develop a dependancy you're fine
Greg,same with coffee
Greg,I know someone who drinks an energy drink every day and he just went to the dentist and apparently he has a cavity in every tooth
Greg,"when my mum was in college she also worked a night shift, and they had a coffee machine with free coffee and one day she realized that she couldn't function without 13 cups of coffee"
Greg,If I have lot of work to do sometimes I will get a drink with 6 shots of espresso 
Greg,Little bit Overkill but it does the job
Greg,I can stay up super late and focus with no assistance from coffee or monsters
Greg,You also don't go to school
Greg,Being social take a lot of energy
Greg,"Patch Notes For 1.3
Time Counters- Name changed to charge counters.
Knight- Added to the game and ability changed from drawing cards upon killing a creature or hitting a player to paying 2 to draw a card.
Spirit- Removed from the game.
Anti-Mage, Spearman, Grand Arbiter, Stasis Chamber, Sage, Guardian, Blacksmith, Zombie, Sword, The Power of Time, Archives, Thundersurge, Dig, Poke, Silence, Foundry, and Forbid- Added to the game."
Greg,The biggest MCG update yet
Greg,2 new pages of cards
Greg,"I can focus late without caffeine or energy drinks, but not for more than two, maybe three days in a row"
Greg,also Octagon feeling the introvert struggle
Greg,I feel your pain
Greg,I'm not even an introvert
Greg,It's just that being social is a lot of work
Greg,that's the actual definition of introverted
Greg,you can be a super social introvert
Greg,it just takes a ton of your energy
Greg,wanna play games?
Greg,@here
Greg,maybe later tonight

Greg,@Mr. Airplane
Greg,Can I get help with one permutations problem
Greg,@everyone
Greg,In how many orders can four students be lined up against a wall if there are six to choose from
Greg,that makes no sense
Greg,I think 6P4
Greg,360?
Greg,it's been awhile since I did permutations and combinations
Greg,im so confused fml
Greg,I think its 360
Greg,"l;'kadfs;'klafds'lk;fkasd;'lk;l'afdsl;'kkl;'fadslk;'dfaskl;'rewqoip[reqwio[preqwio[prqewio[preqw[iopreqwio[pvcxzm,./cvxzmn.,cvzxnm,.zcvxnm.,zvc"
Greg,if I remember correctly it's 6P4
Greg,if that's an option on your calculator
Greg,thats the equation for permuations taken at a time
Greg,there should be an nPr thing
Greg,tell me if it ends up at 360
Greg,I don't think it's going to
Greg,it doesn't matter that they're taken all at once
Greg,it'd be the same thing if you picked one at a time
Greg,I'm 95% sure it's just 6P4
Greg,"(which actually is 360, either max is a god or he just plugged it in)"
Greg,I did not use a calculator
Greg,I did it in my head
Greg,actually not true
Greg,but I didn't use a P function
Greg,I'm gonna assume you know the full formula for it tho?
Greg,its 6x5x4x3
Greg,easy
Greg,suddenly realizes I've been using the overcomplicated version for if you have repeated elements
Greg,goddamn it higher education for making me forget about simple solutions to stuff
Greg,lol
Greg,figured out why my ping was bad
Greg,I have 2 exchange students staying at my house
Greg,and they are both simultaneously using their phones and laptops
Greg,gg
Greg,rip
Greg,dumb chinese people
Greg,jk
Greg,Does anyone here think its normal to call your friends by their last name?
Greg,I think first name is more friendly so yeah last name is a little wierd
Greg,why?
Greg,someone is trying to convince me it is normal but nAH
Greg,I want opinions of people who arent homeschool though
Greg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gia6en2R0Q&feature=youtu.be I heard you guys like sick tracer highlights
Greg,sick tracer highlight
Greg,we still lost that push and the game :)
Greg,we still lost that push though and the game 
Greg,It is normal in some culture
Greg,And I'm sure if ur name is something hard to say like Uvuvwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwembubwem Ossas then people would probably call you by urn last name
Greg,Some of my friends call me by my last name occasionally
Greg,@Feral Nebula it can be used kinda like a nickname
Greg,Like you don't always call the by their last name
Greg,But sometimes
Greg,I think we need a wall between China and the us
Greg,it very much depends on the person
Greg,"it's rare, but some people prefer last name or middle name to first name"
Greg,there was a guy at my elementary school who everyone called Mac and I didn't learn until grade 4 that that wasn't his actual name
Greg,Our school have a guy we call max but that isn't his realy name
Greg,also a lot of asian kids have a legal name and a given name and would much prefer if you used the given one
Greg,"for example, I have a friend whose actual name is Xenswe, but we all just call him Ben"
Greg,(might be a bit off on the spelling it's been awhile since I've actually seen it)
Greg,It happens a lot in sports too. Probably because your last name is what's on all of your stuff
Greg,also in sports some people's last names are just so clearly better than their first names
Greg,like Stan Warinka
Greg,@waowder csgo?
Greg,Aren't you in school
Greg,no
Greg,we had a test today
Greg,@Jed
Greg,play with us too
Greg,I'm sorta in school though
Greg,What is up my dudes
Greg,Does anyone here find shoulders to be sexy or distracting
Greg,no
Greg,lol no
Greg,literally no one does
Greg,my high school was HILARIOUS(ly dumb) about it tho
Greg,"Can't wear: Shirt that exposes your shoulders or stomach
Can wear: Shirt that exposes a solid 50% of your boobs"
Greg,"I mean if you're gonna bring up the whole distraction thing, boobs are clearly way more distracting than shoulders"
Greg,They tried to send me home
Greg,"but even then, NO ONE IS ACTUALLY IGNORING CLASS TO STARE AT PEOPLE"
Greg,Wait they tried to send you home because you were exposing your shoulders?
Greg,wait they tried to send YOU home for exposing your shoulders?
Greg,Yes
Greg,your a dude
Greg,WAIT WHAT
Greg,why
Greg,hahahaha
Greg,Yup
Greg,that's amazing
Greg,thats so dumb
Greg,your school is a trainwreck
Greg,like are you just wearing a tank top?
Greg,Apparently 2 teachers told the office person that I was wearing a tank top
Greg,Like come on don't be a little bitch just dress code me yourself
Greg,Sorry I am a little heated
Greg,I mean I totally would be to
Greg,dress code is dumb enough already
Greg,the shoulders thing is even dumber
Greg,but I've literally never heard of a GUY getting dresscoded for shoulders
Greg,"""oh no his sculpted physique is distracting the class"""
Greg,wait octagon showed his shoulders in school what a slut
Greg,Ha
Greg,I know I'm a whore
Greg,But get this
Greg,Girls are allowed to wear tank tops
Greg,you should have told them it's within your rights to embrace your physical attractiveness
Greg,WAIT WHAT
Greg,Yup
Greg,why is your school so dumb
Greg,Do you understand my frustration now
Greg,thats so wierd
Greg,I mean I understood it before
Greg,but it just keeps getting worse
Greg,WHAT IS YOUR SCHOOL

Greg,Who knows
Greg,"in general, I would say either have no dress code whatsoever or do uniforms, don't half-ass it"
Greg,"and yeah, uniforms kinda suck but there are arguments to be made for it, and most places would just not have a dress code"
Greg,but god damn your school actually sounds like it has the worst implemented dress code I've ever heard of
Greg,Yes it also is dependent on if the office people like you or not

Greg,tf2 is dead

Greg,if you want a good team at least
Greg,yup

Greg,congrats u can read
Greg,proud
Greg,@Bitmin
Greg,picking my degree tomorrow and super stressed about making the wrong choice
Greg,@The Rona what degree are you going to go for?
Greg,Some type of science
Greg,I was thinking of doing science but given my current interests and skill set I think I might do business
Greg,I basically get to design my courses for the first year or so before picking what I want
Greg,cool
Greg,You have to pick something that you're going to enjoy doing in the future
Greg,So keep that in mind I guess
Greg,That was the main reason I decided I probably shouldn't do a science job because I don't really enjoy doing math and I don't want that to be my job
Greg,What type of business do you want?
Greg,business management I think
Greg,don't have to decide the specific type until year 3
Greg,That's pretty cool
Greg,but the general look of the course seems like something I would enjoy and be good at more than the engineering degrees I was looking at before
Greg,Mine is the same
Greg,It is the same in that the specific doesn't come until year 3?
Greg,"Yeah, I have until year 3 to declare a major"
Greg,But I can do it whenever
Greg,Anniversary event
Greg,new sym skin bois

Greg,and the other team isn't letting me play cause I have silver experience from two years ago
Greg,"welp I just rang for a team, and I knew they sucked, but damn they just kicked their roamer cause he didn't know how to rocket jump"

Greg,why does it cost so much to attend GOML?
Greg,venue fee mostly
Greg,wow thats a big venue fee
Greg,"$45 for three days of venue fee, twenty dollars for two events, tax"
Greg,the venue fee at TGC the biggest tournament I ever went to was like $5
Greg,"it's pretty rare to see more than 5-10, but I'm not surprised it's more for a major"
Greg,"they have to cover the venue somehow, and I'm sure booking somewhere this big for a whole weekend isn't cheap"
Greg,Done with finals and got a 100% on my last one
Greg,noice noice

Greg,@everyone Question 6 is up
Greg,Who is the person who answered ambidextrous?
Greg,"@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Any opinions before I officially change the cards?            Patch Notes For 1.4 
Necromancer- Cost reduced from 4>3. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 1 creature at night was removed. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 2 creatures was restricted to night time only. 
Poison Pump- Name changed to Catapult.
Soldier- HP decreased from 4>2
Barbarian- HP decreased from 2>1
Tribesman- Attack decreased from 2>1
Field Medic- Attack increased from 0>2
Break- Added effect “If this card is countered shuffle it into your deck instead of discarding it.”
Counterspell- You now lose 3 life if you play counterspell by sending a card to the void.
 Extract- The player who played extract now chooses which card gets discarded.
Banish- Added effect “You may not have more than 2 banishes in play at a time”.
Knight- HP increased from 3>4.
Spearman- HP increased from 3>4 Attack decreased from 2>1 Damage dealt by ability increased from 3>4.
Stasis Chamber- HP increased from 2>3
Sage- Cost increased from 1>2 Ability changed to “When Sage destroys a creature or damages a player you may add a spell or instant costing 2 or less to your hand”. Rather than playing the card for free and shuffling it back into your deck.
Zombie- HP increased from 1>2 Attack decreased from 3>2. Now only resurrects if you pay 1 resource.
Thundersurge- HP of creatures killed decreased from 3>1 cost decreased from 3>2.
Dig- HP gained by opponent decreased from 2>1.
Sword- Attack gained by equipped creature increased from 3>4."
Greg,I was fond of old necromancer but I think that's why he's getting nerfed
Greg,old necromancer was OP
Greg,"I don't think soldier was all that good, maybe do 4->3 instead, cause otherwise he's almost too squishy (and you've not got that many cards with more than two hp)"
Greg,18/27 of my creatures have more than 2 HP
Greg,"one necromancer tweak I think would be interesting would be something like you have to sacrifice creatures such that the total health of your sacrificed stuff equals the number of resources you'd need to summon the thing you're bringing back, and maybe half that during the night, cause I liked that aspect of him"
Greg,join voice if you can
Greg,so basically you can drop a creature with only two health left to summon one that would require 2 resource to summon
Greg,I can't
Greg,there are two reasons I didn't do that
Greg,also I don't think barb/tribesman were OP
Greg,1 is there isn't enough room on the card to describe such an effect
Greg,2 is that creatures with high attack on low HP would be to good with it
Greg,how so?
Greg,"you're not doing health -> health, you're doing health -> effective resources"
Greg,oh in that case wall would make that super OP
Greg,true
Greg,didn't think of that
Greg,I think the counterspell nerf is unecessary
Greg,me neither
Greg,also I haven't played with or against a bunch of the cards you're tweaking so I'll leave those up to you
Greg,I'm considering how to make necromancer more interesting in the future but for now I just wanted him to not be OP so we can use him
Greg,he is one of the more unique cards
Greg,also I vote changing the name of poison pump to swarm
Greg,ooh I like that
Greg,thats good
Greg,I'll use that
Greg,cool-cool my work here is done
Greg,I think I'm going to reduce the nerf to soldier and counterspell
Greg,I like the extract change
Greg,but doesn't it mean that you see the other person's hand? or you just pick randomly?
Greg,New changes Soldier- HP reduced from 4>3 Counterspell- Lose 2 HP instead of 3 as I plannned before
Greg,you see the other persons hand
Greg,I feel like that makes it really good then
Greg,not as good as before
Greg,it used to be unquestionably the best card in the game
Greg,and it controlled the meta
Greg,then I nerfed it so hard that no one has really used it since
Greg,I'm trying something new in the hopes that extract will become a good but not OP card
Greg,getting ready for that extract banish combos tho
Greg,oh I didn't think of that
Greg,now I'm glad I nerfed banish a little
Greg,rip my cool ideas
Greg,having half of your deck be dead is an unwinnable position
Greg,also your idea still works
Greg,"yeah, if you can get both in your starting hand that is really good"
Greg,Patch 1.5 might include new cards. If so you guys can recommend some ideas for them.
Greg,time to start working on my storm cycle deck which I will of course be calling storm warning
Greg,lol
Greg,@Rotomotorz league
Greg,dude... wall + sword = op?
Greg,maybe
Greg,wall fury was a deck in the original version of my game
Greg,nice
Greg,Also I forget a patch note
Greg,Archives- Added effect “You may not use this ability on cards that can be recasted”
Greg,MCG V1.4 is now live!
Greg,@Mr. Airplane I made a storm warning deck
Greg,but I was gonna do that tho
Greg,you can also do one
Greg,k
Greg,I just wanted to see the different designes we could come up with
Greg,"did you use like scout, dig, visions, wall and stuff"
Greg,some but not all of those
Greg,cool-cool
Greg,My deck can be reduced to I think 4 cards
Greg,all others banished
Greg,although that may not be necessary
Greg,nice dude
Greg,we can test it later
Greg,"as in like, a different day, I'm bouta go to sleep"
Greg,Cool card idea: Watch 3 (Equipment)- Target creature exists in its own time which can be chosen and changed at any time by whoever controls the Watch.
Greg,I like it
Greg,@everyone Question 7 is up! This one was suggested by aeiou.

Greg,"for my brother's uni graduation, he realized twenty minutes before leaving that he didn't own black socks, so he stole a pair of mine and then lost one in a lake"
Greg,LOL
Greg,rip sock

Greg,yea +
Greg,@waowder quickplay?
Greg,TooLegend#11911
Greg,can confirm - fewer things are worse than going through someone else's poorly commented css and trying to figure out what everything does
Greg,saem
Greg,css?
Greg,"stands for cascading style sheet, it's basically what manages colours and fonts and a million other little things on webpages"
Greg,"in general, html says what goes where, css says how it looks"
Greg,and I'm digging through someone else's css and trying mostly by trial and error to figure out what affects what
Greg,and it's brutal
Greg,@Bitmin want to play overwatch in like 30 minutes?

Greg,"also an unrelated question for all you americans, do ketchup chips actually not exist in the states?"
Greg,i have no idea what a ketchup chip is
Greg,nah i'm pretty sure ketchup chips are just a canada thing
Greg,I don't even like ketchup chips but I cannot imagine them not existing
Greg,like
Greg,"literally any time anyone is getting chips for a party or something, you can't NOT bring ketchup chips cause someone there is going to love them"
Greg,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Greg,17 quadrillian degrees dude
Greg,Is it a ketchup flavored chip?
Greg,nah it's chip flavored ketchup
Greg,yeah there's like a ketchup powder thing on it
Greg,that feel when you remember bitmins name used to be bitshock
Greg,WHAT
Greg,I THOUGHT THOSE WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
Greg,well it took the temperature going up to 34 for my family to turn on the AC but at this point I'm just glad it's on
Greg,(also for you americans that's like 93 fahrenheit)
Greg,It's supposed to get that hot in a few days where I am
Greg,And I'm excited
Greg,I love hot weather
Greg,this is too hot for anything other than going to the beach
Greg,ideal temperature is 15-22
Greg,(basically 60-70)
Greg,I prefer between 70-80
Greg,that's probably the second best range
Greg,"also -10 to 0 is pretty nice for winter stuff, cause there's still snow but it's not actually all that cold"
Greg,We rarely get snow FeelsBadMan
Greg,Though we did this year and schools were closed multiple days for like 3 inches
Greg,lololol if canadian schools closed for three inches we'd be off from like mid december till mid march
Greg,with a few weirdly warm days in the middle
Greg,@Jed I'm at a lake so we can use our boat
Greg,"USA and  Canada World Cup teams will be revealed this Thursday at E3 at 5 PM PST, will play against each other in showmatch"

Greg,I was driving through LA yesterday
Greg,And I realized 2 things
Greg,1. Driving in big cities sucks balls
Greg,2. E3 is happening in LA this week
Greg,@Mr. Airplane meme with me
Greg,no
Greg,pls
Greg,no
Greg,y
Greg,how could you
Greg,ur not a tur fren
Greg,tru*
Greg,not on computer
Greg,So???
Greg,I'm sulking
Greg,meme on phone then
Greg,too busy sulking
Greg,lameo
Greg,"He got dumped ok, let him sulk in peace"
Greg,can't spell kameron without name
Greg,cuz his name is trah lmao gg
Greg,i cry
Greg,and also sulk
Greg,that too
Greg,shulk?
Greg,monando
Greg,no
Greg,nintendo's presentation kinda sucked btw
Greg,did we get anything on xenoblade 2?
Greg,ye
Greg,some anime trailers
Greg,no gameplay really
Greg,E3 was pretty lacking this year
Greg,agreed
Greg,suddenly remembers that a) I don't have a switch and b) they're like $600 and c) I don't have $600 to spend on a switch
Greg,nothing was really stand out in any of the presentations
Greg,My friend just got one today
Greg,He went to ebgames during lunch and they had 3 in stock
Greg,naisu
Greg,still not worth tho
Greg,no games
Greg,also he should sell it and profit
Greg,And it was only ~$550 including Zelda
Greg,kameron they have a 40 minute xenoblade gameplay video
Greg,that is a lot of gameplay
Greg,that's not the presentation bruh
Greg,and goddamn it they kept the main character's hella dumb design
Greg,ye
Greg,the game is honestly pretty ugly
Greg,man is wearing hollow harem pants with short shorts under them
Greg,why
Greg,also yeah it doesn't look great
Greg,like ps2.5 graphics
Greg,literally looks worse than x
Greg,which has the terrifying uncanny valley people
Greg,"looks almost as bad as the original, but they don't really compensate with cool looking stuff"
Greg,"but the environments just aren't great in this one, and sure the stylization for the characters means they don't look bad graphically, but they just look awful aesthetically"
Greg,ye
Greg,also the fuck is that girls bust
Greg,I'm 95% that's not how boobs work
Greg,what are you some kinda doctah?
Greg,remembers Fiora and Sharla and basically every female character other than Melia ok I guess that's always kinda been there
Greg,doctor ur supposed to respond because I mentioned medical professionals
Greg,starts watching the trailer THAT IS THE CHRONO TRIGGER OPENING YOU JUST STOLE
Greg,after a brief double check it's the same composer so I guess it's fine
Greg,also HYPE it's the same composer as chrono trigger
Greg,I have not been super hyped for a game and then actually liked the game in such a long time
Greg,last game may have been rivals of aether
Greg,literally after looking at what they have to show the only thing I'm hyped for in xenoblade2 is the soundtrack
Greg,also the boat is still broken rip
Greg,seriously the world looks pretty awful and the character design is actually horrible
Greg,"I swear to god the previous games have so many good character designs (if occasionally poor implementation cause meh graphics), and then SERIOUSLY WHAT IS THIS SHIT https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/e/ee/Switch_XenobladeChronicles2_E32017_character_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20170613180929"
Greg,I left my computer ok man
Greg,DO YOU REALLY NEED ALL THOSE BELTS
Greg,no
Greg,Those belts aren't even holding anything
Greg,Except for the one around his waist
Greg,"and the main female character is made of fanservice - super skinny, giant boobs, basically no clothing, and shorts so short they barely even qualify as shorts"
Greg,thats just sad
Greg,I mean there's always been a bit of fanservice in this series but that's taking it up a few too many levels
Greg,they're basically at the level before kill la kill and THAT SHIT WAS A PARODY OF OVERDONE FANSERVICE
Greg,I'm ok witht eh guy design but the pyra girl whatever is a little much
Greg,"that also somehow managed to slip some actual good character designs in around the fanservice, which xenoblade 2 is very much not"
Greg,"I was kinda hoping they'd do something about the characters after the first trailer came out way back when and everyone kinda went ""wow those characters look terrible"" but nope"
Greg,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Greg,"on the plus side, unless they pull their shit together I no longer have a reason to drop $600 on a switch"
Greg,Splatoon 2?
Greg,Mario Odyssey?
Greg,Kirby Switch?
Greg,FE Switch?
Greg,can we talk about mario oddesssy for a second
Greg,Arms?
Greg,arms is bad
Greg,Metroid 4?
Greg,the free trial was 0 fun
Greg,and how fucking bizzare a cartoonish character looks in a moderately (or at least anatomically accurate) world?
Greg,But it doesnt even look that bad
Greg,I'm not sold on it
Greg,it's a pretty clashing visual style
Greg,"both can work well on their own, but together it's just weird"
Greg,it'd be like anime characters showing up in american cartoons
Greg,also why does nintendo keep making dynasty warriors style games
Greg,"sure hyrule warriors was kind of a cult classic but I feel like a lot of that was people following the LoZ train, and they're kinda boned doing it with series with smaller fanbases"
Greg,Fire Emblem has a respectable fanbase
Greg,"Fire Emblem, sure, but why are they making a Fate/ one? no one actually likes anything other than the animes and the vn"
Greg,they'll lose it if they only have awakening fates and marth so
Greg,"lol ""respectable fanbase"""
Greg,maybe if they added some of the other games
Greg,it'll probably still sell fine with just awakefates + marth
Greg,I mean they got a decently spread cast for heroes (sure it's pretty skewed but at least they got SOME from other games)
Greg,Lmao these Splat Tim memes are so good
Greg,huh?
Greg,In the splatoon tournament at E3
Greg,Tim is a us memeber who got like a 3v1 doubel
Greg,and now the chat memes whenever he does something
Greg,he's not even the best player on the US team but he's a good meme
Greg,(I know nothing about splatoon but that seems cool)
Greg,oh boy the US won
Greg,does this mean the US is finally good at an esport lmao
Greg,@Rotomotorz league
Greg,Actually
Greg,looking at Pyra she's not much worse than fiora
Greg,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Greg,no
Greg,kys
Greg,will do budy
Greg,am not your buddy pal
Greg,am not your pal buddy
Greg,your not my friend unfriended on bnet get fucked lil bitch
Greg,oh......
Greg,com'on man that was too far...
Greg,good god the final mission of xenoblade x is hard
Greg,I mean I might be like 5 levels lower than the boss I'm trying to fight but still
Greg,I keep knocking off most of his health and getting so damn close and then he kills me
Greg,"fuck you, fat man in a large mech"
Greg,"FUCK IT I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW A FEW LEVELS HIGHER AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHOSE BIRTHRIGHT IS PAIN, ASSHOLE"
Greg,lol someone is a little upset
Greg,bastard has so much health
Greg,and he keeps spawning stuff that has lots of health
Greg,and then he goes invincible AND REGENS HIS HEALTH
Greg,AND THEN SPAWNS MORE THINGS
Greg,wow that sounds terrible to play against
Greg,I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S THE FINAL BOSS I'M ONLY ON PART 3/5 OF THE MISSION
Greg,also it's actually a pretty fun fight
Greg,but I'm really feeling the AI handicap
Greg,I feel like if somehow I could have three additional humans handling my party members I could win this fight
Greg,Is that possible?
Greg,nope
Greg,but hey at least the ai's not as bad as in the original
Greg,and at least the music's hella badass
Greg,@Rotomotorz league?
Greg,sure hold up i'm patching
Greg,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch

Greg,congrats
Greg,also there was a twist where I had almost the right idea and I'm so mad
Greg,I almost predicted it
Greg,my logic was so almost but not quite correct
Greg,was it a good game?
Greg,yee
Greg,"definately have some issues with the game, but overall good"
Greg,(also I'm hella nitpicky so most of the issues are pretty minor)
Greg,Going to attend the MCG conference tomorrow?
Greg,probably yeah
Greg,can't wait to be back
Greg,also I swear they saved like all the best songs for the last little bit
Greg,pre-final boss - awesome music
Greg,final boss - awesome music
Greg,"cutscene in between the two of those, hella pretty"
Greg,credits theme - damn good
Greg,"most of the rest of the game - occasional scattered good songs here and there but the ones you hear a lot (normal battle theme, hub area, etc) kinda crappy"
Greg,aw really you're gonna end it on another twist and leave some stuff totally unexplained
Greg,dammit
Greg,you'd better make a fucking sequel
Greg,that looks better than xenoblade2
Greg,Still a good game

Greg,"basically a friend of my brother's is like ""yo make me a website and if it's good I'll pay you"""
Greg,and they also haven't emailed me back about a whole bunch of stuff for like two weeks -_-
Greg,rip thats pretty unprofessional of them

it went something like this: What do you call a blueberry that made a mistake while filming?
A blooperberry
why"
Greg,What is a smokers favorite kind of berry?
Greg,A rasp-berry
Greg,oh my god
Greg,I am the pun king
Greg,@Zain can I make a daily pun text channel?
Greg,sure
Greg,NICE
Greg,Oh I forgot to say last night about the Your Eternal Reward that your cloak drains 50% faster
Greg,@Max @Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak
Greg,wow that's awful
Greg,I mean no one used it anyway
Greg,but why encourage people to not use it even more
Greg,That's what I'm saying
Greg,I like how it is now
Greg,"It's supposed to be a fun gimmick, not a viable weapon"
Greg,@here ovahwatch???
Greg,@Bitmin @Zain
Greg,@Mr. Airplane level up that alt man
Greg,mmmmk
Greg,Rip computer
Greg,IM DECAYING :[
Greg,@Mr. Airplane @Zain 6 wins and 2 losses so far in my placements.
Greg,I think my mother board is dead
Greg,wow that sucks
Greg,didn't you just get a new computer
Greg,Well it isn't new
Greg,The motherboard was still stock
Greg,And had been used somewhat
Greg,@Bitmin 5 mins
Greg,oh shit I though the life is strange sale was $5 per chapter but it's $5 for the whole thing
Greg,I MUST GET IT
Greg,that is cheap
Greg,"Did you paly the demo, Quick?"
Greg,no
Greg,I still haven't finished the demo but I'm liking what I've seen so far (and yes I know that wasn't directed at me)
Greg,but 5 dollars for the whole thing is worth it
Greg,"it's on sale till the 5th, give the demo a shot first"
Greg,"Also by demo, it's actually the full first episode"
Greg,Also I got a Switch today!
Greg,
Greg,cool-cool
Greg,nice nice
Greg,SYLKI HOW DARE YOU STEAL MY SAYING AFFIRMATIVE WORDS TWICE THING
Greg,thats my thing
Greg,I SAY NICE NICE ALL THE TIME
Greg,THATS A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Greg,YOU'RE A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Greg,THATS NOT VERY NICE NICE TO SAY
Greg,also code geass is really good
Greg,yeeee
Greg,how far are you?
Greg,curently on episode 15
Greg,and the code geass binge continues
Greg,it's impossible to not binge your first time through
Greg,feelsbadman?
Greg,I watched the whole thing in four days
Greg,both seasons?
Greg,and the first 46 episodes in 3
Greg,yeah the whole thing
Greg,wait how many seasons are there?
Greg,just two right?
Greg,just the two
Greg,c2 is confusing
Greg,they're doing a third but there's a decent chance it's just a cash grab cause apparently the studio's not doing so well and it does seem odd that they'd suddenly rejuvinate the series like 9 years later
Greg,WOW CHIKON YOURE SUCH A WEEABOO
Greg,yur bad at overwatch
Greg,ok
Greg,at least I'm not a filthy weeb
Greg,OH WAIT XDDDD
Greg,yeah I was gonna say
Greg,you have an animoo profile picture
Greg,shhh
Greg,we dont talk about that
Greg,at least you're not like the closet weeb from kingston
Greg,"apparently, changing his tag to Kaneki ""wasn't a weeb thing or anything"""
Greg,LOL
Greg,"but at the moment his profile picture is Rem from re zero and that whole ""not a weeb thing"" is looking even less plausible than before"
Greg,he just needs to accept it
Greg,being a weeb is fun
Greg,hear hear
Greg,"(don't kill me kameron, hear hear is a thing that needs to go twice)"
Greg,lol
Greg,YOU SHALL BE PUBLICALLY EXECUTED SYLKI FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST MY IDIOSYNCRASIES
Greg,OBJECTION!
Greg,you can't make me
Greg,"also, @Mr. Airplane @The Rona @Rotomotorz you guys want to try starting the race over tonight?"
Greg,Maybe
Greg,If I'm not caught up playing Zelda :L
Greg,Maybe as well
Greg,"Look out for a Discord user by the name of ""Kazuto Kirigia "" with the tag #2169 .

Greg,@Zain
Greg,Can you review a vod for me later
Greg,Im uploading it to youtube and could really use some feedback on this particular loss 
Greg,sure
Greg,@Zain
Greg,"Thank you im uploading it now. I played mostly mcree, but threw in some stall heroes at the end"
Greg,
Greg,@everyone
Greg,so close to my season high
Greg,Oh wait this belongs in the memes channel
Greg,@everyone i lent trap my adblocker account and he won feelzgoodman
Greg,Feels good man
Greg,"don't know if anyone here still plays fe heroes but the voting thing is crazy close - they're apart by ~1.2 million points, which seems like a lot execpt that the scores are both almost thirty BILLION"
Greg,aka they differ by 0.012%
Greg,voting on what?
Greg,it's basically waifu wars
Greg,"(this time at least, normally it's not JUST girls)"
Greg,who are the two characters being voted on?
Greg,this time around it was basically who's the best healer character and it's ended up narrowed down to elise and priscilla
Greg,and given that I never used priscilla in fe7 I'm backing elise
Greg,we're down 1.2 million
Greg,So your supposed to vote on character strength?
Greg,naw just how much you like the character
Greg,So even if one is clearly better you could still vote for the other just because you like them better?
Greg,yeah
Greg,also all the healers kinda suck in this game
Greg,so you're not really voting for whoever's the strongest
Greg,and while you do get slightly better prizes if you win it's not really that significant
Greg,i am confirmed masters player

Greg,I remember when he died I had two thoughts. #1 Hooray a dangerous terrorist is dead. #2 Oh darn this will make Obama look good (I think the election was soon to occur).
Greg,is making Obama look good a bad thing?
Greg,I wanted him out
Greg,why?
Greg,because his political opinions didnt align with his
Greg,Too many reasons to explain in text but to put it simply I am a Republican and he is not so why wouldn't I want him out.
Greg,I mean being a Republican doesn't mean you have to dislike a Democratic nominee.
Greg,A nominee which I disagree with on 90%+ of issues is not going to have my support.
Greg,^^^
Greg,truth
Greg,Well what did you not agree with him on?
Greg,nearly everything
Greg,Remember the part where he said there was too much to explain over text
Greg,^^^
Greg,"also I wasn't trying to disprove your statement, just bringling light to the fact that the ""He's Democrat i'm Republican"" thing doesn't hold much weight on it's own"

Greg,I was trying to end this conversation.

Greg,time to spam andrew with voicemails
Greg,lol
Greg,do it
Greg,you won't
Greg,lol
Greg,already did it
Greg,I just had the dumbest shift of my life
Greg,shift was 300-530
Greg,"I get paid by the delivery, and no one orders food during that time period"
Greg,normally I'd get two or three deliveries for that
Greg,"I got one delivery, and I had to wait till 445"
Greg,wow that sucks
Greg,delivery fee - $7
Greg,tip - $21
Greg,I'll take it
Greg,"so basically I sat around for two hours, worked for twenty minutes, made almost $30"
Greg,sounds like a weird job
Greg,like not profitable very much
Greg,or am I wrong?
Greg,yeah it's super not profitable
Greg,"it pays well per hour, especially if you can get a dinner shift (530-830 is suuuuch a good shift to get), but there aren't many shifts"
Greg,seriously the 530-830 pays about $20 an hour

Greg,@Master Memers we should get more dude Bros in here
Greg,why though
Greg,IDK
Greg,Why does hyp keep getting kicked
Greg,He doesn't do anything wrong
Greg,because no one likes him
Greg,???
Greg,Mrd do you like hype
Greg,"To me, it seems like he doesn't care about us. Maybe? Dunno."
Greg,No he likes being in here. He really wants to be involved
Greg,that's too bad
Greg,Who keeps kicking him?
Greg,he is banned
Greg,Really?
Greg,yes
Greg,fusion was the one who kicked him the first time and trap invited him back
Greg,I honestly have no clue.
Greg,Why is he banned
Greg,What did he do
Greg,@Jed
Greg,I did have one experience where he just joins a channel other people are in and just leaves.
Greg,I do that
Greg,Maybe invite him back and ask him
Greg,"And if he gives a valid reason, ban him again, unless you hate him"
Greg,
Greg,Okay okay point taken!
Greg,it was agreed upon by many people to ban him
Greg,so it stands
Greg,I didn't hear about that so I didn't know.
Greg,Nah
Greg,That's not valid there wasn't a vote
Greg,When fusion gets back we're taking a vote
Greg,no
Greg,max is admin
Greg,Yes
Greg,For now
Greg,Then ask him
Greg,I will talk to Fusion about this when he gets back for now I will drop it
Greg,4 of the master memers agreed
Greg,fusion kicked him in the first place
Greg,4 out of 8
Greg,That's not even a majority
Greg,"(for the record I just kinda shrugged my shoulders and didn't vote, but I'm not against it, I can see why he rubs a lot of people the wrong way)"
Greg,and the others don't even know him
Greg,That doesn't include the other members
Greg,"also let's be fair, smithy and bitmin are hardly around, fusion's gone and left max in charge"
Greg,"All I'm saying is when fusion gets back, I'm going to ask to have this reconsidered"
Greg,"He's my friend, and I really like having him around"
Greg,That is all
Greg,/End
Greg,woah
Greg,private calls are a thing
Greg,who knew
Greg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Greg,/End
Greg,"Who knew, weaponized autism is a thing that infects over 69 million 8 sided shapes a year"
Greg,༼ つ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ  that's where you're wrong kiddo
Greg,aight if this keeps devolving into throwing shit at each other I'm gonna have to request that you just do it in pms
Greg,when you lose control of a situation it automatically shoots to insults huh
Greg,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Greg,I'm done
Greg,also I realize I could have done a sick pun with pms and PMs but I wasted the opportunity
Greg,dang
Greg,"""If you guys are gonna go all PMS on each other I'd appreciate if you did it through PMs"""
Greg,boom
Greg,what a missed opportunity
Greg,rip
Greg,I'm not the one who started with a bad attitude about this. Also okay @Sak von Sak I'll move this so I don't end up bannerinod

Greg,@Trapezoider
Greg,newt films?
Greg,one of the things I love about one of the webcomics I'm reading is that everyone who reads it has been conditioned to it being depressing so that any time something nice happens we all get really scared
Greg,even though nothing particularly bad has happened for like five chapters (of seven)
Greg,but you can't just kill off half the cast two chapters in and not expect people to be constantly nervous
Greg,@Jed thank you yes
Greg,yeah boi

Greg,I need to create a new Facebook
Greg,yeah

Greg,

Greg,Mayo @Rotomotorz
Greg,@Jed
Greg,The feeling when you skip your families arbitrary religious weekly ceremony of church so your parents unplug the router and lock the door leaving you home alone without internet
Greg,But then you discover you have an lte hotspot your pc can connect to
Greg,Feelsgoodman
Greg,Can't you just plug the router back in?
Greg,The door to the router is locked
Greg,I don't know where the key is
Greg,:(
Greg,Use a Bobby pin
Greg,How tho
Greg,Is it ez
Greg,??
Greg,It's just one of those little hole locks right?
Greg,Ye I think so
Greg,Lemme check
Greg,Yeah
Greg,I used to do that all the time as a kid
Greg,if you have enough data to get on discord you have enough data to look up how to pick locks
Greg,^
Greg,Okay
Greg,Let me discover a Bobby pins
Greg,Pin*
Greg,although you may end up convincing your parents that you're basically just slowly backing into the depths of hell and you'll be in even more trouble
Greg,just a warning
Greg,Yeah if you plug it back in they'll be angry
Greg,Risk/reward
Greg,My parents think I'm going to hell because I subscribe to evolution as the most practical model of biological origins
Greg,So that's a good point
Greg,I mean aside from the hell thing you'll still probably get in more trouble
Greg,They half jokingly talk about it like that. Not sure if they mean it
Greg,Feelsvadman
Greg,Pc thrown in trashcan 
Greg,Lol
Greg,I would kms
Greg,And sabotage my dad
Greg,oh yeah that was just fantastic when it happened
Greg,I just used it as a metaphor/emphasis thingy/whatever you would call it dammit it's been too long since I took english as a class
Greg,Wait
Greg,Jed will tweezers work?
Greg,I can't find Bobby pins
Greg,Probably not
Greg,if you're talking about a regular locked door a screw driver works
Greg,That too
Greg,at least my type of doors
Greg,A tiny one?
Greg,I have a tiny one
Greg,try it
Greg,Does it need to be flathead?
Greg,idk
Greg,@Jed joinup

Greg,Gotta hide the evidence before they get home lol
Greg,"so I mentioned a few days ago that everyone reading one of my favourite webcomics is getting super nervous now that good things appear to be happening, and THIS ISN'T HELPING https://twitter.com/cubewatermelon/status/894052619173449729"
Greg,I love seeing different people's expectations for what's going to happen after this latest Sleepless Domain page. The next page is Good IMO https://t.co/vEKM2QRguf

Greg,At all costn
Greg,Also how with scissors?

Greg,they must be small scissors
Greg,Yes
Greg,Also now my mother hates me for not going to church

Greg,and they locked you out for not going to church?
Greg,Ye
Greg,They r dumb
Greg,Are they in the house right now?
Greg,Yes
Greg,I wouldn't lockpick with them there
Greg,thats risky

Greg,Gotta wait
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,he left
Greg,How good are you with web elements
Greg,You mean like website coding?
Greg,Yes
Greg,I would estimate I know about 1% of total coding knowlege
Greg,so terrible
Greg,Okay
Greg,I'll wait for fusion xd
Greg,"Dang shroud makes almost 250,000 a year just off twitch subs"
Greg,Assuming they are all the cheapest sub option
Greg,Wow thats what most houses cost where I live
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Plus whatever c9 is paying
Greg,Dang

Greg,Yup
Greg,Shroud is dank
Greg,

Greg,@here cs:go in a lil bit?
Greg,or rivals
Greg,or anything
Greg,@here
Greg,anyone good with wordpress??
Greg,I am possibly down for things
Greg,sure
Greg,http://newtfilms.com
Greg,Newt Films
Greg,The Future of Filmmaking
Greg,@here
Greg,what do you guys think so far
Greg,NOt done
Greg,Just general theme n stuff
Greg,"it looks nice but one small thing, why is youtube green?"
Greg,All the bright colors make me feel like its and ad
Greg,maybe that's just me
Greg,they're not that bright
Greg,You got a reason why blue green yellow purple are your main colors
Greg,im gonna try and figure out how to change the stuff to red black and white
Greg,Thats our colors
Greg,I agree that youtube should be red for recognizeability
Greg,yeah
Greg,Cant figure out how to do it with the assets Im using
Greg,said bois
Greg,Oh in that case it's fine then
Greg,also a newt film logo or something instead of the cavern maybe?
Greg,thats why I asked if anyone is good with wordpress
Greg,or something film related at least
Greg,ALso thank you for feedback
Greg,okay our logo actually looks like ass
Greg,No if those are you colors then it makes more sense to stick to those instead
Greg,whats wrong with your logo?
Greg,I thought it was fine other than the art maybe having a few minor mistakes
Greg,
Greg,that just looks so ugly to me
Greg,Bleh
Greg,Put the newt on top of films
Greg,
Greg,This one looks good
Greg,On business cards
Greg,Just elegant
Greg,Simple
Greg,Not so IN YOUR FACE BYATCH
Greg,Eh
Greg,"I think if you put the newt on tip of films, starting from the right edge of the F and then extending to the end of the S, it'll look fine"
Greg,lol that logo took our guy like 6 months because hes a lazy piece of shit. I hardly want to ask him to do another thing. Gotta find another guy tbh
Greg,does anyone have the old frostbite logos. Also thank you @Rotomotorz
Greg,"However also make the height of the word newt taller than the gap between the top of the F and the top of the I, so it doesn't look like Fnewt films lol"
Greg,lmao gonna steal them 
Greg,no just curious
Greg,Lol frostbite
Greg,I built a new pc
Greg,So I lost them
Greg,be there soon octagon

Greg,"Eighth-grader Shigeo ""Mob"" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks. In order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Reigen Arataka, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Greg,lol bye
Greg,wait is doctor back
Greg,are we playing bl2?
Greg,no nerd
Greg,why
Greg,doc = too tired
Greg,gg
Greg,I'm super tired man
Greg,doc is a dork
Greg,.org
Greg,where did that joke originate?
Greg,Umm guys
Greg,Umm trap
Greg,@Rivals of Aether Someone play against my ori
Greg,@ me anytime to play
Greg,oh shit that's out?
Greg,goddammit I'm still stuck with my terrible internet
Greg,When do you think you'll be back?
Greg,shrugs
Greg,he's not getting better as fast as he was supposed to (largely because he's super stubborn and not doing all the stuff he's supposed to to help him get better) so I can't even really follow the doctor's estimate cause that was supposed to be sunday
Greg,is he fun tho?
Greg,yes
Greg,However I'm still in the SDing when going offstage due to not knowing when I can jump out of my arials phase.
Greg,lol
Greg,His recovery is definitely the best in the game if you are high and definitely the worst if you are low
Greg,well actually wrastor is probably better high
Greg,All around air is just as good as I thought it would be
Greg,he seems pretty nuts from what little I've seen
Greg,and I feel like he's gonna be one of the those characters with a steep learning curve
Greg,aka I'll probably suck at him
Greg,From what I can tell his weakness is having 0 kill setups
Greg,still gonna give him a shot once I'm back home
Greg,I think I'm going to try and get good at him
Greg,wait that seems kind of crippling
Greg,or does he just have enough stuff that can kill that it doesn't really matter?
Greg,His smash attack hitboxes are REALLY BIG
Greg,like BIG
Greg,its insane
Greg,like etalus big?
Greg,bigger
Greg,the fuck
Greg,etalus fsmash actually covers 1/4 - 1/3 of the stage (depending on the stage)
Greg,That is because he moves
Greg,not because the hitbox is big
Greg,it covers less space than etalus fsmash but the hitboxes on upsmash and downsmash are huge
Greg,so basically big band? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/276801025258684416/288837755247525889/bb-cmk.png
Greg,but with a small hurtbox
Greg,not that big
Greg,at some point we eventually need to play more SG
Greg,(I say while trying to learn blazblue)
Greg,Ori will be good at edgeguarding etalus
Greg,he has a move that is almost exactly like wrastors down smash
Greg,return of the downsmash vs tech wars of early 2017
Greg,@Sak von Sak I think Ori is going to be one of my favorite characters
Greg,@Jed ROA?
Greg,in a bit]
Greg,@ me when ready
Greg,@Max
Greg,@Max what are the best melee ai?
Greg,Link and captain falcon in vanilla
Greg,umm
Greg,But probably fox on the latest 20xx since he has actual tech skill
Greg,that's not what max said he said gannon was best
Greg,i don't remember the other one though
Greg,Max has done several ai tournaments and pretty sure link has won them all almost
Greg,Luigi
Greg,Wait.falcon may have been bad
Greg,Yeah Luigi and link I think
Greg,Me
Greg,Yeah kameron too

Greg,thats false
Greg,welcome to oregon
Greg,in the winter
Greg,there was a break yesterday for a few hours
Greg,and its only been three days
Greg,too bad its rain and not snow xd @ oregon
Greg,we actually had snow last year
Greg,but also rain
Greg,mostly just rain
Greg,I've seen it snow enough in a single night that it practically shut down the city for about a week
Greg,yay canada
Greg,woah
Greg,same
Greg,"except it was like 4"""
Greg,still basically shut down the city 
Greg,Yeah seriously
Greg,Oregon drivers are pussies
Greg,yeah thats pathetic
Greg,Gets single snow flake
Greg,to be fair
Greg,west salem is hills
Greg,"""SHUTDOWN WHOLE DAMN ROAD"""
Greg,and it was ice under snow
Greg,Ava Texans are no better with snow xD
Greg,also we have like what 1 snow plow?
Greg,"well there is no snow to speak of, ever"
Greg,"it was some weird freak of temperature and stuff where it snowed a ton, rained a bit, then the rain froze, the whole city was under like a foot of ice, massive power outages across the city, technically drivable but horrifyingly unsafe roads (which we used anyway to make it somewhere with power)"
Greg,at least in southern texas
Greg,one of my friends who lives three blocks from me had no power for three weeks
Greg,aaaAAAA
Greg,no power makes me wanna die
Greg,"no internet, no a conditioner/heater, to way to make food"
Greg,try no power and temperature below freezing
Greg,how did you live
Greg,we ran away to somewhere with power
Greg,"if you couldn't do that, layers and layers of clothing and blankets, use of fireplaces, sharing body heat, etc."
Greg,sounds terrible
Greg,sometimes im salty I never get snow but then I hear about how bad snowy places have it
Greg,"""sharing body heat"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Greg,"that's by far the worst I've seen, usually it isn't so bad"
Greg,but honestly snow's not all it's cracked up to be
Greg,it's nice for the first month or so
Greg,then it's kinda annoying
Greg,my childhood dreams are crushed
Greg,and come february/march you just want nothing to do it anymore
Greg,
Greg,yeah its novelty wears off fast
Greg,"skiing and skating and sledding and snowball fights are still fun, but you kinda stop doing any of that after the first bit"
Greg,I love ice skating but the nearest rink is like an hour away
Greg,rip
Greg,nowhere I've stayed in canada has had a rink more than like a fifteen minute walk away
Greg,time to move
Greg,15 minute WALK?
Greg,yeah
Greg,How many ice rinks must there be to have one so close to everyone
Greg,shrugs welcome to canada
Greg,also generally I've only stayed in family-focused residential areas so those tend to have rinks nearby
Greg,"To be sure of hitting the target, shoot first and call whatever you hit the target."
Greg,some quote ^
Greg,That sounds so awesome
Greg,I'm really into skating sports
Greg,I'm kinda good for a novice
Greg,Lodda fun
Greg,I'm pretty awful at em but they're a good time
Greg,@everyone let's do the Meetup in Canada
Greg,no
Greg,yeah
Greg,"I can't go to Canada, no way my parents would let me"
Greg,too far
Greg,good we don't want you
Greg,jk
Greg,depresso
Greg,that means max wouldnt go either
Greg,nah max is an adult
Greg,he's 17
Greg,and living at home
Greg,but will be 18 by the time we go anywhere
Greg,yeah but I'm sure our parents will still stop him
Greg,I'm just sad we don't have enough west coasters to justify going somewhere where there's in&out
Greg,yeah
Greg,I mean if you guys want to come out I wouldn't be opposed
Greg,eh transport'll be way more
Greg,and this way I don't have an excuse
Greg,they have them in texas
Greg,thats the furthest east I think
Greg,This is getting insane
Greg,I saw someone riding a jet ski on a road I sometimes drive on...
Greg,oh god that's amazing
Greg,Not if you live here and may have to evacuate.
Greg,We might be running out of roads to leave on.
Greg,true
Greg,So are you gonna leave soon
Greg,are things still good where you are?
Greg,We just learned that leaving is impossible at this point. So it looks like we are going to have to camp on our second story if things get bad.
Greg,For the moment though things are still okay.
Greg,but you mostly live up there anyway so...
Greg,True but we will have to cut the power to the house.
Greg,Well shoot
Greg,Stay safe man
Greg,that sucks
Greg,yeah stay safe and keep us posted
Greg,I'll update you guys if things get worse
Greg,Thanks for the support
Greg,np
Greg,Yo if you have to cut power you won't have discord right?
Greg,don't die
Greg,I have a phone now
Greg,do you have data tho?
Greg,yes
Greg,That's my number
Greg,(oh right it's the states data's way cheaper)
Greg,"@Max  question, if you do have to camp on the second floor, would it be possible just to cut power to the first floor?"
Greg,I'm not sure
Greg,woah what an idea
Greg,that could save my sanity
Greg,i ask cause one of my friends is in the same situation you might be in and they only cut breakers to the first floor
Greg,Ava it's literally flooding and you worry about wifi
Greg,it isnt about wifi

Greg,Still okay
Greg,that's good
Greg,mrd where are you at?
Greg,cause don't you live near max?
Greg,I doubt we'll get hurt. More likely our things will be ruined with water. Luckily we have flood insurance so that is covered as well.
Greg,"yeah, besides I've been EXTEMELY lucky for my street or anywhere near my house not to be flooded"
Greg,@Trapezoider am ready any time

Donald J Trump sits straight up in his interview chair. In his pitifully tiny hands, he hold a smartphone. He is using the front facing camera to check himself out, and preen himself up as he prepares to be on camera
TRUMP (TO SELF)
You're a winner Donald, a winner I tell yah
Donald winks to himself and clicks off the phone, and puts it into his pocket
DIRECTOR
President Trump, are we ready to roll yet sir?
TRUMP

You bet it James! 
Trump says as he winks
TRUMP
Are the incredible men and women on this set ready to capture my fantastic appearance today? 
JAMES
Yes President Trump. We have been preparing for this shoot for a few weeks. Were all very eager to get this over with.
TRUMP
Fantastic!
James walks out of frame and trump sits up extra straight in his seat.

Alright Everybody!

Camera heads swivel into posistion

Action!
A slate man appears in front of the main camera and clicks the slate board.
James nods to trump
TRUMP
I will never forget, the day I won the election in 2016. It was amazing, truly fantastic. Really shows that america is a nation of faith, a nation of faith in me. Donald J trump. 
Trump looks down and takes a deep breath through the mouth
TRUMP
Sadly folks, crooked Hillary is trying to bring me down this election cycle. Shes trying to say I worked with Putin, really great guy by the way, to win last years election. That's why I need your help. I need you, and the rest of America to come together, and make this election great. So that I can win, and keep crooked politicians like Hillary and Berney out of office! They would make a huge...
Trump suddenly gets distracted and pulls his phone out of his pocket.
TRUMP
Hehe, Megan Kelly responded to my apology tweet
TRUMP
In Megan Kelly Voice Impersonation Mr Trump I find your lewd comments, rude and offensive
Rolls eyes at camera
TRUMP
I demand you make a more formal and respectful apology, I am uphalled!

Greg,"JAMES
whispering Donald, we need to get this back on track!
TRUMP
Oh, right
Trump puts the phone back into his pocket
TRUMP
And that is why I need your help to keep berney and Hillary out of office by voting me in instead. I promise, if you vote for me, I will literally buy all of your children I phone 8's. I have HUGE amounts of money because of how successful and fortunate I am! I swear if I wasn't for TRUMP brand I couldn't count a dime to my name, but I swear to God, you put my name and some god damned gold on a building, and you will be rich out of your mind
James can be seen making huge x motions with his hands
TRUMP
James why are you doing that with your hands
James walks into frame, and on set. 
JAMES
Donald, we talked about this extensively before hand. This is network television, you cant swear and say whatever the hell you want! I need you to tone it back, or were going to have to cancel this broadcast.
TRUMP
...
TRUMP
You know what James. I'm going to make you an offer.
James sighs and shakes his head in regret
JAMES
Whispers to self Oh lord what this time...

Greg,"TRUMP
 James, M gonna make you an offer, here it is. I will buy your entire studio and network, and you let me run this cast how I see fit. I have a HUGE message I am trying to get to the american people James.

You know what Donald, you do whatever the hell you want. You have infinite money, if you fuck up this broadcast, and get me in trouble with the network, I will let you handle it.

Greg,great game in general
Greg,Brilliant example of how to make a great single player experience
Greg,yup
Greg,literally my main complaint is that that one semi-automatic rifle was kind of op but not super exciting to use
Greg,The carbine?
Greg,I think so
Greg,Yeah that thing was busted
Greg,yeah its was
Greg,I only use the pistol in machine gun for the first half of the game
Greg,Then shit got way too hard so I started using real guns
Greg,yeah the difficulty ramps way up in the last third or so
Greg,Now my go play Bioshock and BioShock 2 right
Greg,I should probably play those too
Greg,I bought the package all three remastered for 20 bucks
Greg,@Jed
Greg,also imo the most fun gun combo is hand cannon + that rebel shotgun that lights people on fire
Greg,That thing didn't have any ammo though
Greg,yeah they're both pretty low on ammo
Greg,I wish I'd had more money on my plate through cause then I could have got more cool upgrades
Greg,I didn't say it was practical
Greg,I think we can all agree the repeater was booty though
Greg,which one's that?
Greg,It was like the machine gun but with the less ammo in the slower rate of fire. It was a vox gun
Greg,yeah
Greg,and takes fire up to be accurate
Greg,dude the insane asylum part was spooky
Greg,when ben franklins head rolled out i paused and walked away
Greg,???
Greg,Oh
Greg,I didn't get spooped
Greg,But it was very atmospheric
Greg,I expected a big attack after it
Greg,Jed
Greg,Gaymez?
Greg,what
Greg,yes
Greg,oh god the asylum
Greg,fuuuuck that was some creepy shit

The demo is available to download through battle.net. It doesn't matter if you are new to the game because if we manage to get a big enough game the large number of players will balance out the more skilled players as they can be teamed against. I think this could be really fun so I hope enough of you are willing to give it a try for us to play! Confirmed players so far: Me, Sylki."

Greg,tuesday is hell tho

Greg,Ouch
Greg,yikes
Greg,6.5 hours of class spread haphazardly across 12 hours of time
Greg,HaA
Greg,Sucks for you mAtE
Greg,also what kind of whack scheduling led to this being a thing https://gyazo.com/66af9112c8a2d59d60c1de02a293ddcc

Greg,"two 1.5-hour segments of the same class, an hour and a half apart, in different lecture halls"
Greg,"on the flip side, for winter term (january-april) I have 7 fewer hours of class per week"
Greg,and no classes friday
Greg,seriously winter term is a joke for me https://gyazo.com/f2346dd6cd66473f5a2477a1cbe7f2a1
Greg,Gyazo
Greg,"12 hours a week, no friday classes, one online course"
Greg,Why would you get your classes so far apart?
Greg,Mine are 10 minutes apart
Greg,although for one of those I'll have to cross the campus in those 10 minutes oops
Greg,"cause these are all the only timeslots for these classes, or I used these specific ones in order to not have friday classes"
Greg,"also I like having spaced out classes, gives you time to relax and do nice things like eat or chill at the library in between"
Greg,I'd much rather have three hours of class with 3 hour gaps than three hours of straight classes with ten minute breaks and the rest of the day off
Greg,and honestly I'd put up with a lot for perpetual 3-day weekends
Greg,"which will probably translate to me doing a lot more out of town smash tournaments, especially if I can find people to carpool with -_-"
Greg,@Max how was your first day of college?
Greg,It was fine
Greg,Had to park super far away from my class
Greg,How were the classes tho
Greg,First day was just learning about the course
Greg,no real work
Greg,"oh yeah you've never had syllabus days before, have you?"
Greg,expect that for the whole first week
Greg,That's how it usually is
Greg,Whole first week?
Greg,"One of the first things my EDUC prof said to us is ""I like to cuss a lot so if that offends you please switch classes""."
Greg,yeah profs are also an interesting mixed bag
Greg,EDUC?
Greg,It is a required course where you learn about college and how to succeed in life
Greg,"also yeah for uni it's usually the first week, cause you've got your courses spread out by day (you start doing stuff in some courses but it's mostly review of previous material)"
Greg,seems like an easy A
Greg,that sounds either really useful or incredibly boring

Greg,@Sak von Sak stop playing psp and play rivals with me
Greg,"I'm not really in the mood (kinda platform fightered out, playing badly today and I'm frustrated)"
Greg,lets play a different game then
Greg,i need someone to hang out with
Greg,"housemates are already going to sleep, can't talk either way"
Greg,  
Greg,
Greg,@Mr. Airplane are you an uber driver now
Greg,no
Greg,oh lol
Greg,^
Greg,my stats prof opened our first class by just kind of playing jazz over the speakers for the first five minutes
Greg,but why
Greg,cause he's a super chill old guy
Greg,haha early classes
Greg,I already had an 830
Greg,and I have classes today until 8pm
Greg,tuesdays are hell
Greg,My mondays suck
Greg,But your tuesday seems worse than my monday
Greg,All my days are the same
Greg,I have class from 8:30-6:50
Greg,I've only got 6.5 hours total but they're spread out and I'm basically stuck on campus all day
Greg,That's the same with me
Greg,all my classes are like an hour apart
Greg,"I've got some half hour breaks, some hour and a half, some two hours, but never at convienient times to go back home until the end of the day"
Greg,You need that briefcase setup
Greg,"He just put up a slide that just says ""How not to fail STAT263 and any non-fakeable course"""
Greg,shots fired
Greg,"he just showed us his first year transcript, his highest mark is a 67 and he failed some"
Greg,what a baller
Greg,"and now he's literally going ""english.  I could fake that.  Calculus, not so much"""
Greg,his average was a 48
Greg,How did this mans become a professor?
Greg,he's telling the story of how he turned his life around
Greg,"and he actually just said ""I'm probably the only person teaching right now who had a year like this"""
Greg,"he says he's willing to print out a certificate that says ""For what it's worth, this is to certify that [YOUR NAME HERE] is, in fact, smarter than Professor Charles Arthur Molson"""
Greg,man gives no fucks
Greg,"""What I hope to hear said about me is 'Damn, that dumb son of a bitch can really teach'"""
Greg,and he's now pulling bad reviews from his own ratemyteacher page
Greg,"""if you're sleeping in my class, that's fine"""
Greg,now he's using a picture of grafitti from a queen's bathroom stall to demonstrate statistics
Greg,what a god
Greg,he's planning to use the distribution of cell phones ringing during his lectures as something we're going to study
Greg,"""When the grim reaper comes for you, you will never get these stat263 hours back"""
Greg,"""Ha! And you were wondering what scary thing to dress up as for halloween? LURKING VARIABLES"""
Greg,I figured three hours of stats every tuesday would suck but this man is great
Greg,"man has started cracking borderline dad jokes 
""Helen - the face that launched a thousand ships, and from whom we get the objective measure of beauty;  the milihelen, enough beauty to launch one ship"""
Greg,what a gOD
Greg,someone in one of my classes has the most fantasy-sounding first name I've ever seen - their name is literally Bronwyn
Greg,that is awesome
Greg,no idea if it's a guy or girl
Greg,"@Liberals Out of curiosity which of these people would be considered the most privileged, a gay white male, a straight black male, or a straight white female?"

Greg,yo anyone want to play l4d2 or csgo or something?
Greg,maybe
Greg,NO
Greg,Ava how do I get gud at pay
Greg,Osu
Greg,Jk osu is for gay retards with autism
Greg,"how did you manage to mispell osu as pay?  it literally requires not only both hands to be in the wrong place, it then requires one hand to overcorrect and end up in a different wrong place"
Greg,it's only three letters
Greg,that is honestly impressive
Greg,@trap kys
Greg,osu is for cool weebs
Greg,'cool weebs' is an oxymoron
Greg,uH no
Greg,you're a weeb too sylki
Greg,did I ever profess or pretend coolness?
Greg,o h
Greg,Sylki on on mobile
Greg,O is next to P
Greg,S is next is A
Greg,U is next to Y
Greg,Also auto correct
Greg,"the point was that o->p would put you towards the right, and u->y to the left"
Greg,but mobile autocorrect makes sense
Greg,Sylki
Greg,Can you become my basement space
Greg,lol
Greg,Slave
Greg,To do my hw
Greg,God damnit auto correct
Greg,the hell is going with your autocorrect
Greg,IDK bro

Greg,@Trapezoider @Sak von Sak Don't forget that we are going to try some SC2 tonight
Greg,k
Greg,bruh i think I'm tripping on acid or something
Greg,I felt something moving around in my headset and I took it off and saw a big earwig
Greg,so i threw it down
Greg,and now its gone
Greg,not in the headset or anywhere around it
Greg,wtf
Greg,and now its gonna take me 4 years to get the pads back on
Greg,update I am not on drugs I found the earwig and killed  it
Greg,I also only have 1 earpad on so far
Greg,gg
Greg,the task is done
Greg,literally 20 minutes later
Greg,I hate cloud 2's
Greg,0/10 don't use if you have anger problems

Greg,gross
Greg,that was in my headset
Greg,please delete your headset
Greg,@Max @Trapezoider when are we gonna starcraft?
Greg,I'm good whenever
Greg,or just do something in general
Greg,I vaguely remember we played once and you actually know what you're doing so I'm gonna advocate waiting for trap before we start
Greg,thats fine
Greg,@Trapezoider
Greg,@Sak von Sak I steam messaged trap and we should be good to go when he is done with H1Z1
Greg,sounds good
Greg,What is your main race?
Greg,protoss
Greg,white
Greg,dabbled in zerg but I don't really remember most of it
Greg,I usually play Terran but I've considered swapping to Protoss
Greg,i too dabbed on zerg
Greg,my brother played terran and I vaguely remember swarms of marines and medevacs that were a bitch to deal with as protoss if I didn't have templars
Greg,that can happen
Greg,medivacs I think
Greg,"shrugs I wouldn't really know, I was just mashing medicine and evacuate together"
Greg,Evil Emperor Zurg?
Greg,Woah
Greg,also if I remember correctly the reason I ended up mostly not playing zerg was cause my brother and dad both played a lot of protoss and used mostly flying stuff that I couldn't seem to beat cause the only big zerg units could only hit ground -_-
Greg,I'm sure there's a way around that but I have no idea what
Greg,Hydralisks
Greg,Corruptors
Greg,Vipers
Greg,"everying zerg is a -lisk, you'll have to remind me what all these things ar"
Greg,are hydralisks the flapping things that shoot bouncing shots?
Greg,no
Greg,those are mutalisks
Greg,those suck at anti air
Greg,they are flying anti worker mainly
Greg,shrugs for now I'll stick to protoss
Greg,you should because if you do we will have all 3 races in our ffa
Greg,noice
Greg,diversity
Greg,Diversity is our strenght. Socialism our goal. Equality our ideal. WE ARE LIBERALS!
Greg,Yo Kameron you wanna play some Overwatch @Mr. Airplane
Greg,a little bit later
Greg,in prac rn
Greg,sad
Greg,I'll continue with my spanish then
Greg,d'accord
Greg,I'm slightly bothered by the fact that he was talking about spanish and you repsonded in french
Greg,I'm slightly bothered by how long that took you to type

Greg,I have an 8:30 tomorrow
Greg,;-;
Greg,I have a 130 tomorrow and nothing else

Greg,I have 4 or 5 classes tomorrow

Greg,alright
Greg,hopefully you and trap finish around the same time
Greg,@Sak von Sak @Trapezoider Before we start I'm going to give you guys a refresher on invisible/flying units so someone isn't crushed due to not knowing how to beat either of those things

Greg,@Sak von Sak Is it possible to use a calculator to solve matrix's?
Greg,You would probably need a sophisticated calculator to do so
Greg,if you've got a graphing calculator
Greg,there's definately some online stuff that'll do it for you tho
Greg,My friends calculators have them
Greg,well rip I don't
Greg,"also, matrices is the plural of matrix"
Greg,^
Greg,whatever
Greg,I've been at this for like 4-5 hours
Greg,Is this graded?
Greg,I think I was intended to use a calculator but I didn't know that
Greg,yes
Greg,"just google ""online matrix solver"" and roll with that"
Greg,@Sak von Sak couple more games of rivals?

Greg,like holy shit
Greg,this game is amazing
Greg,What platform is that game on?
Greg,ps3 and ps4
Greg,"seriously tho, the story's getting super awesome, plus I'm currently in a position gameplay-wise where I'm having to pull out all stops to try and not die and the way they're coinciding is making everything even crazier"
Greg,"goddammit I'm basically out of mana and running low on mana-replenishing items, so I'm working with my team of mostly physical attackers and the boss KEEPS CASTING A THING THAT LETS HIM REFLECT PHYSICAL ATTACKS"

Greg,"It’s helpful of the college to provide financial aid to students who otherwise couldn’t afford school. I don’t know any veterans who are college aged, but if I did I would definitely tell them about the veteran’s benefits they can receive. Getting a good job is probably the most common goal for college students. Everyone with this goal should pay a visit to the CASA building to see career counselors and advisors. The CASE building is definitely a fun place to hang out and play video games!"

Greg,he had partial ownership of a goat while he was in the military and he loved it
Greg,it was his platoon's goat
Greg,Why does a platoon need a goat?
Greg,no idea

Greg,proof are pretty much just applications of all of those things
Greg,but yeah I can see why you don't like em

Greg,see GOML 2016

Greg,@here gamezzz?
Greg,rivals?
Greg,sure
Greg,be there in a second
Greg,@Rivals of Aether any1 d0wn
Greg,@Max
Greg,be there in a second
Greg,I just got home and I've got early classes so I'll pass
Greg,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/177839064/
Greg,"Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share"
Greg,"Make games, stories and interactive art with Scratch. (scratch.mit.edu)"
Greg,I am a master game dev now go try out my newest title 
Greg,@Jed This gave me a 404 error
Greg,oops
Greg,idk
Greg,Your game is broken bro
Greg,I want to plaY it
Greg,404 for you too?
Greg,Ye
Greg,What's it about
Greg,try now
Greg,works now for me
Greg,its a work in progress
Greg,did you actually make this?
Greg,yes
Greg,the jump distance seems to be inconsistent
Greg,each jump goes the same height
Greg,or did you mean the pipes?
Greg,jumps
Greg,nope each jump is 10 pixels
Greg,I still have to add a scoreboard element and a background change
Greg,Now I want to try making something
Greg,scratch is fairly easy to learn
Greg,no actual writing code
Greg,its all in blocks for you to put together
Greg,how do you get it to restart without reloading the page
Greg,the green flag
Greg,oh
Greg,I could make a start button but that would be too much work
Greg,l a z y
Greg,wow this game is very hard
Greg,its flappy bird
Greg,but memes
Greg,i am aware
Greg,so my exam schedule just came out
Greg,I didn't quite pay attention to which of my classes do and don't have exams
Greg,"but as it turns out, I only have one exam"
Greg,so that worked out well
Greg,@Sak von Sak play rivals with me
Greg,"in a bit, studying for a midterm atm"
Greg,I will tho
Greg,get in here jed
Greg,ya big nerd
Greg,@Max play the ow halloweeb event with us we need a fourth
Greg,doing homework
Greg,@Sak von Sak nice name
Greg,cheers
Greg,I figured I'd go with the theme
Greg,but now that you're not supply depot anymore we need another supply depot
Greg,I'm back to that
Greg,yee
Greg,lol
Greg,@here ayy you guys wanna play some cs?
Greg,maybe yesterday
Greg,"gotta study and eat, but maybe later tonight"
Greg,I'm checking out dust_new
Greg,wanna queue with me?
Greg,instead of checking out dust new
Greg,Later maybe
Greg,I might play
Greg,In like a while
Greg,RIP my awesome winter term schedule
Greg,"dropped one of my courses for this term, replaced it with a different one next term (that everyone says is easier and the prof's not an ass, and where I can take either for my degree), and now I've lost my super easy schedule and no friday classes"
Greg,Rip
Greg,"on the flip side, at least this term should be manageable"
Greg,cause that one course was occupying like half my time and I was doing terribly
Greg,and I'd already gotten in a mini-fight with the prof
Greg,Yeah that's no good
Greg,What class is this?
Greg,"digital systems, it's basically agressive circuitry and the nuts and bolts of how computers are put together"
Greg,which should be super interesting
Greg,I agree
Greg,"but the prof subscribes to this ""innovative"" teaching model which is really good in theory - the dry lecture learning stuff is done outside of class, then class time is for application of what you've learned and you can ask questions and stuff really easily"
Greg,the problem is that he kinda forgot about the whole applying stuff in class part
Greg,"so it's pretty hard to make sense of anything cause a) first class after readings is a test on the readings without an opportunity to ask about anything you're confused about, then in between that and the other class of the week there's an ""in-class assignment"" which isn't done in class, and he doesn't reply to email questions about it so you still don't really know what you're doing for it, then the second class he takes up the test and stumbles around trying to answer questions about the actual content we're confused about"
Greg,"on top of which, there's labs every couple of weeks, which are even more complicated, and by terrible scheduling, I have other lectures during almost all the open lab sections where you can show up and work with the TAs to get stuff done (the only one that I can show up to I can only show up to half an hour of it, which isn't enough), and the software we have to work on is super buggy on my computer and periodically just freezes and deletes whatever project I was working on if I kill it with task manager"
Greg,"and when I asked him for an evening-long extention in light of this (was due at 4pm, but there was an open lab for it from 5-7 that night which I could go to), not only did he not give an extention, he also just gives instant zero to a late submission"
Greg,and that was going to happen pretty much every lab
Greg,so we got into a bit of an argument about that
Greg,this is also the course where everyone is slowly bailing
Greg,"I started out in a 5-person group, two people dropped, he mashed the remaining three together with two other groups so we then had an 8-person group, which has now dwindled to a 5-person group (4 now that I've dropped)"
Greg,"td;dr - cool sounding course, prof butchered any reasonable chance of understanding it and is also stupidly rigid in how he handles things, about half the class has dropped and I'm incredibly happy to be part of that half"
Greg,Sounds like hell
Greg,Meanwhile I am sitting here trying to be productive during my unexpected 1 hour break by writing out code on my phone
Greg,
Greg,you really need a laptop
Greg,Check it out
Greg,I really do
Greg,This is kind of painful
Greg,I can imagine
Greg,but seriously how are you doing the whole uni thing without a laptop?
Greg,are you taking notes by hand?
Greg,Yeah
Greg,It's not too bad
Greg,It just sucks when I have these breaks
Greg,"get a cheap laptop, do work during breaks"
Greg,I spend most of my breaks off the corner of one of the libraries doing assignments or studying
Greg,it's honestly really good for productivity
Greg,you can probably get a laptop that does what you need for a couple hundred bucks at most
Greg,somewhat related but Android studio makes me want to rip my toenails out
Greg,@Sak von Sak I approve the switch back to your old (and obviously superior) profile picture
Greg,eh I like them both but this one shows better in the discord bubble
Greg,@Rivals of Aether games?
Greg,I'm in
Greg,Girls can now join the boy scouts
Greg,...
Greg,Yup
Greg,I happen to remember something called the girl scouts existing so this seems pointless
Greg,Girl scouts leadership ran it into the ground
Greg,@Rivals of Aether games?
Greg,in a few minutes
Greg,"well rip me, 2-0'd one of my melee demons only to immediately lose my next two matches and not even make top 8"
Greg,"on the flip side, my record against sasquatch is now 3-15"
Greg,a marked improvement
Greg,also I had a weird run through like all the people I usually fight
Greg,"please let me fight someone other than sasquatch, dayman, and milk"
Greg,I almost always fight two or more of them per tournament
Greg,3/4 tournaments I've fought dayman and at least one of milk or sasquatch
Greg,holy shit one of the compsci academic advisers here is named Erin Gunsinger and that might be the most badass name I've ever heard
Greg,oh snap
Greg,thats lit
Greg,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Greg,COLLEGE APP DUE TOMORROW YOU FOOL
Greg,don't worry about it i believe in doing everything at the literal last second
Greg,SCREW YOU
Greg,@games here?
Greg,@here
Greg,im down later
Greg,@Jed gamezzz?
Greg,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Greg,did you deafen me fusion?
Greg,I got through the entire starcraft brood war soundtrack (47:50) 3 and a half times while doing homework. Why must it be so long.
Greg,are Koth maps bo3 now ? in comp ?
Greg,indeed my dude
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,anime
Greg,my dude
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,SLEEP
Greg,SOON
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,LEAVE ME ALONE
Greg,@Sak von Sak sleep is for the week
Greg,@Sak von Sak would you rather sleep or watch anime i already know its watch anime to comoooon
Greg,grumble
Greg,what would we watc
Greg,"black clover, my hero academia, monster"
Greg,I've already watched like all of mha
Greg,at least all that's dubbed
Greg,"ew Sylki, you refuse to watch subbed even if thats all there is ? ? ?"
Greg,no that's not what I said
Greg,I've watched a lot of things that have only sub
Greg,sounds like it
Greg,and a lot of subs for stuff where I didn't like the dub
Greg,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Greg, An error occurred: Error: socket hang up
Greg,"also ava just to clarify that discussion cause I wasn't paying a ton of attention (and was also like half asleep), MHA has simultaneous sub and dub, the dub is really good but delayed by about a week, which I'm willing to wait"
Greg,o h  I see
Greg,Is being straight kinda gay
Greg,i mean think about it
Greg,you're into someone who sucks dick
Greg,@Sak von Sak rivals in 30?
Greg,Yes
Greg,eh sure
Greg,we could do a 4 man tourney if @Max is down
Greg,yee
Greg,@Max you down my dude?
Greg,octagon why
Greg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Greg,I can't tell if you just did that as a counterpoint to my name or if you're carefully avoiding Zack Attack
Greg,Doing school reading. We'll see if i can play or not.
Greg,the world may never know
Greg,people only play ori now and its annoying as hell
Greg,ori's kinda broke
Greg,and easier rushdown than wrastor
Greg,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Greg,"kk, gonna make a bathroom run first"
Greg,Can't sorry busy with school work
Greg,just play anyways
Greg,read while playing=profit
Greg,do school later
Greg,no
Greg,ez
Greg,
Greg,also if we do a tourney you can play during offtime
Greg,@Max doki doki literature club?????
Greg,what?
Greg,it says you're playing it
Greg,It's more important than his schoolwork
Greg,I just finished my school work
Greg,then join us my dude
Greg,eh
Greg,mini tourney
Greg,I only have like 25-30 minutes of free time before I need to start on more school
Greg,that's enough time
Greg,ye
Greg,Ava's comments on this game make me want to continue
Greg,we wanna see where everyone stands in skill rn
Greg,and octagon's like good at this game now
Greg,keeping it close with me in kragg dittos
Greg,I know I've played him a lot
Greg,come on you can play it whenever
Greg,Also I'll lose because you are all warm and my first 5 or so games I suck
Greg,wrastor is hard man
Greg,we'll open with round robin
Greg,"and then top two play for 1st, bottom two play for 3rd"
Greg,Another time
Greg,bruh
Greg,I don't feel up to it right now
Greg,and I know it will take longer than I have
Greg,30 MINUTES HUH
Greg,dear friendo
Greg,if you don't want to play with us
Greg,just say so
Greg,don't make them excuses
Greg,Miraculous Youngster is a beast ow team

Greg,"@Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane I started my assignment at 11:00 which is almost exactly 30 minutes after I sent my message. I do not lie and I did indeed have a school assignment to do. After I finished it, you guys were playing csgo which I had no interest in therefore I didn't feel the need to say anything about finishing. I don't make things up or lie. If I simply didn't want to play I would have said so, like I do whenever Overwatch is suggested. In those cases I'm sure you can remember many ""no I don't want to""'s. If you want I can even screenshot my ceritficate of completion of the assignment that I am emailed if you do not believe me."
Greg, best emote
Greg,
Greg,"K fair @Max, you can understand our assumption tho"
Greg,"Yeah I understand, I just wanted to clarify my innocence."
Greg,Idk still seems shday to me
Greg,"on an unrelated note, who's down to do a 5-queue with our names as Zack Attack, Zack Defense, Zack Sp. Attack, Zack Sp. Defense, and Zack Speed? @Cs:go"
Greg,"not now, but like, tonight some time"
Greg,I call Zack Speed
Greg,Yee
Greg,also I have more work tonight so maybe not
Greg,we'll see
Greg,I'm doing math now but I have a paper later
Greg,we'll see I guess
Greg,try to get as much done as you can
Greg,btw I'm going to be carving my profile picture into a pumpkin for halloween
Greg,the terran crest?
Greg,yes
Greg,that's pretty sweet
Greg,Its probably my favorite faction logo of all time
Greg,"all the sc ones are pretty sick, personally I prefer the protoss one"
Greg,go figure
Greg,its also cool
Greg,"I'm also pretty partial to the persona 5 player faction/crew logo, though it's not the kind of thing you can engrave on a pumpkin, at least not easily"
Greg,thats in interesting one
Greg,it's also kinda weird cause you don't actually get a character who wears a hat until pretty late in the game
Greg,and it's not even really a top hat
Greg,@Sak von Sak  I just started doki doki and i'm so on edge because the only thing i've heard about it is what you put in the memes channel
Greg,lol
Greg,I haven't gotten far enough for anything to actually happen either
Greg,but I'm terrified of everything
Greg,Its quite an experience
Greg,and there's this tiny part of me that thinks it might all just be a huge meme and it's actually a totally normal story and they just got everyone to say it goes hard in the psychological horror
Greg,which would be really funny
Greg,but I'm hoping that doesn't happen
Greg,
Greg,oh dang I have to write a poem?
Greg,yup
Greg,it doesn't have to make sense
Greg,just do what I did and choose your favourite word from each page and see where it ends you up
Greg,or be super tactical and choose the ones you think will impress your future waifu(?)
Greg,you guys gotta pick words to please a specific girl!!
Greg,^ was about to say that
Greg,yea
Greg,WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBS
Greg,"yeah I noticed, but they jump when I pick darker words"
Greg,I picked based that way and 16/20 seemed to make the purple hair girl happy so.... shrugs
Greg,
Greg,I think they jump for the stuff they like
Greg,yes
Greg,
Greg,THATS STILL SPOOKY
Greg,also I've barely gotten past the poem bit so don't say anything that happens after that
Greg,got it
Greg,"except maybe who ended up the happiest from your poem, cause curiosity"
Greg,spoiler-free catholic discord
Greg,yeah I wanna know too :0
Greg,whoever you choose the most words for you spend the day with at the club before reading poems
Greg,well obviously i'm going for yuri because she's best girl
Greg,nO
Greg,ew
Greg,Natsuki > Sayori > Yuri
Greg,wow
Greg,i guess it's ok to be wrong
Greg,Sayori > Natsuki > Yuri
Greg,Natsuki is a weeb and a tsundere ! ! Tsunderes are funny characters
Greg,natsuki is trash
Greg,Yuri is trash
Greg,no u
Greg,chill
Greg,in the small portion I've played I'm gonna have to agree with smithy here
Greg,oh boy
Greg,aaAAAAA
Greg,not necessarily on the best girl part cause I'm not far enough to have an opinion on that yet
Greg,but on the fact that natsuki seems annoying
Greg,shes funny imo
Greg,shrug
Greg,I don;t like tsunderes
Greg,"the general archetype works fine, it's just when it's played totally straight that it's annoying"
Greg,"you can either use it as a small part of the character (see: kurisu in steins gate), or blow it wildly out of proportion for comedic purposes (see: nichijou)"
Greg,"wait, who's the tsundere in nichijou?"
Greg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQq5d6v59xg
Greg,Nichijou - Clean Up

Greg,oh right I totally forgot about her lol
Greg,literally the most tsundere character I've ever seen
Greg,welp
Greg,"in an epic lack of proper group communication (my fault as well), two separate group members each did about half of the project"
Greg,now we're gonna have to compare and see whose stuff to keep
Greg,You mean you split into 2 teams and each did the same half?
Greg,naw we just figured we'd get started on it before discussing it with the group (I didn't bother telling them cause they didn't start early last time and I just dropped a 2/3 finished project on them and said do the rest and that worked out just fine)
Greg,but we both decided to start and not tell anyone
Greg,oh okay
Greg,Mine would have been funnier
Greg,and cause it's programming it's entirely possible that even if we did exactly opposite halves we won't be able to just mush them together
Greg,well it does look like we did nearly opposite halves
Greg,so at least it'll be easier than if we'd both done totally different parts
Greg,"@Rivals of Aether My opinions on each characters worst matchup                                                  Wrastor>Maypul
Zetterburn>Wrastor
Absa>Kragg
Etalus>Zetterburn
Orcane>Etalus
Kragg>Orcane
Zetterburn>Absa
No apparent counter>Forsburn"
Greg,btw Good in matchup>Character being countered
Greg,not sure about the kragg > orcane thing
Greg,In my experience it is true because he can power through bubbles
Greg,his only way to power through bubbles is sideb
Greg,which is really easy to counter
Greg,thats enough
Greg,you can get through and immediately put yourself in a terrible position
Greg,worst matchup does not mean bad
Greg,its cause max always beats me in that matchup 
Greg,I don't think orcane has any matchups that are very bad at all
Greg,altought i agree that kragg counters orcane for the following reasons
Greg,all of his moves slightly outrange or outprioritize orcanes options
Greg,"I feel like zetter, absa do better against orcane"
Greg,orcanes biggest strength is edgegarding and kragg cant be edgeguarded
Greg,you can't out-camp absa with bubbles
Greg,orcane beats both of them imo
Greg,the weight matchup is wierd
Greg,rocks>bubbles
Greg,and I dunno if zetter's actually good but I randomly pulled my half-decent zetter and beat kameron
Greg,if you get hit by kragg as orcane you're pretty much dead
Greg,eh only if he's got the right setups in place
Greg,like only if I can bully you offstage into rock rock rock rock
Greg,Kragg gets huge punishes of almost everything
Greg,^
Greg,you just have not figured it out yet
Greg,yes but I feel like he blows at getting in
Greg,his biggest weakness is his approach sucks
Greg,i kinda disagree
Greg,eh
Greg,His approach is fine
Greg,my defense on orcane is just good
Greg,speaking of rivals anyone wanna play
Greg,im down after dinner
Greg,I'm down
Greg,lol maybe in a little bit
Greg,4 man tourney les go bois
Greg,maybe we'll get that 4-man tourney going
Greg,surprised one challenged my forsburn statement
Greg,i have to do it soonish tho
Greg,none of us know forsburn
Greg,^
Greg,i think he gets countered by iceguy
Greg,he can combo etalus really well but maybe
Greg,"generally speaking though, my general reasoning for why kragg >>> orcane doesn't entirely hold up is just from fighting kameron a ton, going more or less even with my kragg and then doing about the same with my worse characters"
Greg,which doesn't quite make sense
Greg,you put orcane >>> etalus and my etalus usually does alright
Greg,Kameron plays against 3 Kragg players and is just good at the matchup
Greg,well i have tons of practice against kragg
Greg,fair
Greg,also yeah we have all kind of gravitated over to the rock beetle
Greg,I'm going to make a more detailed ROA stats/opinions list shortly
Greg,also I've gotta say I love octagon's kragg
Greg,it's got the same dumb reads I get only more
Greg,although as soon as I started reading his reads things went downhill
Greg,cause he goes for the same reads a lot
Greg,ill be there at 7 and then we can do a 4 man tourney
Greg,@Sak von Sak GET IN HERE BOIIII
Greg,finishing a bagel then I'm in
Greg,@Sak von Sak how long does it take to eat a bagel?
Greg,long time
Greg,is actually several bagels
Greg,with a bunch of stuff on them
Greg,"I just got my first ""ending"" and I don't know how I feel"
Greg,"good job, queen's 
http://www.cp24.com/news/330-charges-laid-33-arrested-during-homecoming-at-queen-s-university-1.3634572"
Greg,"330 charges laid, 33 arrested during homecoming at Queen's University"
Greg,"Police say they laid hundreds of charges during Queen's University homecoming celebrations in Kingston, Ont., over the weekend."
Greg,"and I'm assuming one of those would involve one the brother of one of my housemates, who got stabbed in the face"
Greg,"(he's fine, more or less, but he'll probably have a scar)"
Greg,good old homecoming
Greg,props on them for doubling the numbers
Greg,on them?
Greg,to them?
Greg,I think 'to them'
Greg,^
Greg,yeah
Greg,unfortunatley I care not enough to fix my bad grammar
Greg,@Sak von Sak friendlies?
Greg,sure
Greg,get in here nerd
Greg,"sec, bathrooming first"
Greg,"This is very important
Some guy on our team was 1-13 and we're like ""Darius you're shit at this game""
AND THIS MAN GOES ""Oh yeah well i can speak 2 languages"""
Greg,"like good for you, you still suck ass at league dont play ranked"
Greg,Gottem
Greg,Welp today's the day we get new rivals characters and I've got lectures and meetings till 930 and a few tests to study for
Greg,rip
Greg,I actually have my first class off
Greg,So I'm testing the new characters right now
Greg,Clairen is super fun
Greg,Ranno as seems fun
Greg,general playstles?
Greg,Clairen looks like she will be a all around character. Her neutral and punishes both look good. Ranno looks to be a powerhouse on stage that will be easily gimped.
Greg,first impressions
Greg,I have a feeling there is going to be at least 1 character (I'm thinking absa at the moment) who is going to do AWEFUL against Clairen.
Greg,do either of them have the nice movement à la zetterburn?
Greg,"mostly clairen, I enjoy not getting gimped a ton so I feel like I'll probably like her more"
Greg,Froggy boi seems op
Greg,"all in all, we need more non-kragg mains in this discord so maybe this will help"
Greg,Yeah I'ma get the dlc
Greg,"we basically have two and a half kraggs, one and a half orcanes, and a wrastor"
Greg,I'm kinda an everything
Greg,yeah but your kragg's probably your best
Greg,"maybe I'll adjust down to just two kraggs - me, kinda you, kinda max"
Greg,@Rivals of Aether If anyone wants to help me test Ranno and Clairen just @me.
Greg,The amount of creative potential present in Clairen's increased hitpause on tipper is huge.

Greg,we needed a hype falcon
Greg,nah
Greg,too many falcons

Greg,two is too many?
Greg,yes
Greg,I'm pretty sure S2J has never done better than 0-2 at summit
Greg,he really shouldnt go
Greg,i just wish pewpewu got the w
Greg,what about the eight foxes (and m2k's kind of a fox)
Greg,that's literally half the summit

Fox - 8
Falco - 1
Marth - 1
Sheik - 3
Puff - 1
Peach - 1
Falcon - 2
Luigi - 1
Yoshi - 1"
Greg,the best part is that a fox probably wont win
Greg,unless you count armada
Greg,which I did
Greg,the real dream is amsa winning
Greg,no
Greg,"the highest paying tourney, ever"
Greg,m2k winning is the dream
Greg,"just, surprise yoshi wins"
Greg,"rough order of what I want to see: Amsa, Plup, Hax, Blea Gelo, S2J, Axe"
Greg,pulpW
Greg,@Sak von Sak rivals in 30????
Greg,shore
Greg,@Sak von Sak get in here famerino
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,I'm still eating
Greg,i cry
Greg,it's only been like 25 minutes
Greg,I'm torn between finishing this and not
Greg,cause it's so good
Greg,but I'm so full
Greg,and it's so salty
Greg,what is it?
Greg,there's like no moisture left in my mouth
Greg,I made the most badass sandwich
Greg,"i say, toss it in da trash"
Greg,and come play with me
Greg,"I cooked a bunch of beef and mushrooms in garlic butter, those + turkey + boursin on a pretzel bun"
Greg,unbelievably good
Greg,you know whats even better
Greg,playing roa
Greg,fine I'll do a quick bathroom run then fight you

Greg,Same
Greg,I want to drop it so bad
Greg,colour me throroughly confuzzled
Greg,Shh it's fine
Greg,I'm confused too
Greg,Bout why we have a league channel
Greg,I think foosion still plays every now and then
Greg,But with who?
Greg,inappropriate name
Greg,actually his name
Greg,oh yeah I've seen him a few times
Greg,I thought you just like didn't want to type his name 
Greg,@Max
Greg,yeah?
Greg,your dad and I have something new to get along about
Greg,Factorio
Greg,neat
Greg,that game is amazing
Greg,I'm doing a research paper on the safety and usefulness of GMO foods

Greg,World's Best Smash 4 Player Is Worn Down By Haters And Harassment
Greg,"For 13 minutes, Gonzalo “Zero” Barrios’ face barely moved. It was the Grand Finals match of a Super Smash Bros. Wii U tournament, and Barrios, the best Smash player in the world, was squaring off against a formidable opponent. A few feet away, Barrios’ bodyguard kept a lookout for a man who’d threatened to be there, in wait, with a gun aimed at the champion gamer."
Greg,@Mr. Airplane Someone asked me to tutor them how much should I charge?
Greg,"I don't know what a reasonable amount is, but make sure you start by asking what they'd be willing to pay first, in case it's way more than what you were gonna ask for"
Greg,also depends on what you're doing
Greg,i charge people $5 to look at their completed code if it doesnt work and i fix it
Greg,one guy literally just forgot to indent something
Greg,i hit the tab key once and got $5
Greg,but if its something more important and difficult like physics definetly raise ur price
Greg,also little haggling tip if they tell you to make an offer always ask more than you want
Greg,that way when you lower your price to what you want they feel like they're getting a deal
Greg,@Rivals of Aether games?
Greg,@Max
Greg,What is it?
Greg,@Jed
Greg,rivals?
Greg,not until my rehabilitation (spelling?) is complete
Greg,oh
Greg,@Sak von Sak play some RoA with me my dude
Greg,in a bit
Greg,or if we can get a 4th
Greg,for what?
Greg,so that one of us doesn't have to sit out?
Greg,oh right max isn't playing
Greg,max isnt gonna play
Greg,nvm
Greg,I won't be playing
Greg,I'll be in in like 5 minutes
Greg,mmmk
Greg,aye boiz I'm in top 500 of rivals
Greg,457
Greg,358 and I'm calling it good
Greg,@Max I now am able to accept the rivals skill gap as you have 198 hours compared to my 39
Greg,well I got to my first ending in doki doki literature club
Greg,conclusion - should not have done this right before going to bed
Greg,What did you think of the game?
Greg,also did you see the title screen after finishing
Greg,Yup
Greg,Title screen was fucked
Greg,I  don't really consider that me finishing the game
Greg,I'm not letting it end like that
Greg,yeah you gotta play more
Greg,it only gets better from here
Greg,canada cup's looking pretty damn good
Greg,"we've already got armada, leffen, m2k signed up"
Greg,why do we need blea gelo at summit when the best luigi in the world is already attending
Greg,because the best luigi in the world doesn't play luigi
Greg,this is true
Greg,wait are we even refering to the same person who are you talking about

Greg,gotta eat dinner
Greg,and I'm kinda all smashed out
Greg,and hella salty
Greg,I just did worse than I ever have at a kingston tournament
Greg,and then proceeded to play like two hours of salty fox dittos
Greg,I have reached an impressive level of simmering anger at this point
Greg,nah just do it
Greg,play me fool
Greg,I GOT 17TH
Greg,I DID WORSE THAN SENDO
Greg,AND I LOST TO BUCKTOWN
Greg,yeah but you can get first in the 1v1 against me in rivals
Greg,AND QUINCY
Greg,QUINCY WAS 22 SEED
Greg,the two hours of salty fox dittos did help me get my fox back on track
Greg,but I really can't face more platform fighters right now

Greg,yeah but like

Greg,I might join depending on if I can find my friends or not 
Greg,ecksdee
Greg,still pretty annoyed because I'm usually super consistent and I just played like ass today
Greg,and there's a monthly tomorrow and my confidence has gone down the drain
Greg,"lololol I was on commentary for a bit on the stream, I watched a bit and due to our shitty mic it sounds like I have some super weird accent that's a blend of like scottish and australian"
Greg,@Rotomotorz do you want to do 5 tp mission
Greg,i already did
Greg,@everyone Sylki and I are currently hosting a creative writing project. In this project we are going to be agreeing on a basic story premise and taking turns writing chapters after that. We already have 4 people and are looking for 1 more so please PM me if you're interested. We are looking to make a serious story so if you plan on meming your way through it don't bother signing up.
Greg,"Sylki, that's just how you sound normally"
Greg,What do you mean?
Greg,look up a couple of messages
Greg,I was replying to his earlier statement
Greg,"also, I did better at the monthly (waaaay more stacked) than the weekly -_-"
Greg,wait the pyro has a jetpack now\
Greg,ok
Greg,It's shit
Greg,It's really really bad
Greg,okay but like
Greg,still
Greg,I've been playing all of yesterday and today
Greg,@Max I met a good wrastor
Greg,"welp at the monthly, top 8 was initially 5/8 kingston people, and now we've reached top 3 and it's just the out of town people"
Greg,"also top two seeds from my pool both made top eight, backing up my claim that I got the hardest pool"
Greg,"except maybe the ryan ford, sandman, sasquatch pool"
Greg,that one was pretty viscious
Greg,@everyone I need a new headset anyone have any legit suggestions
Greg,"I've got a razer kraken, it's pretty good"
Greg,thats what i got right now
Greg,i was gonna get another one unless i got a better suggestion
Greg,get some sennheisers
Greg,Cloud 2's are good
Greg,What is a cloud 2?
Greg,@Sak von Sak fight me rivals lets go
Greg,in a bit
Greg,nah right now
Greg,lets go
Greg,ok fine later
Greg,@Max what were you gonna say my dude
Greg,I was going to say you should know not to disturb those in the literature club
Greg,im guessing you dont want to play rivals
Greg,Hyperx cloud 2's
Greg,MAX YOU'RE SCARING ME
Greg,why?
Greg,I just meant that most people playing DDLC don't want to stop because they want to see what happens
Greg,this game's scary enough without slightly suspect phrasing outside it too
Greg,@Jed fite me
Greg,no
Greg,@Max i downloaded starcraft
Greg,"Doing something, I'll be there soon"
Greg,not too soon though
Greg,Sylki and I can teach you
Greg,I barely get what I'm doing

Greg,@Trapezoider Kameron is learning starcraft if you want to help educate him
Greg,Lots of quotes tonight eh?
Greg,doctor
Greg,more like
Greg,test proctor
Greg,gottem
Greg,rekeronied
Greg,@Rivals of Aether I beat someone on the ladder who had around 1200 rank points!
Greg,Noice
Greg,"My group for one of my classes is writing a report, one section is on ""issues and lessons learned"", and one thing that happened was we asked our assigned TA - a guy named Hang - for help and advice on part of our presentation (which was a required thing) and he didn't get back to us for like a week, literally until the evening before the presentation and after we'd handed in the slides and couldn't change them anymore.  We're having a dilemma on whether we should phrase that problem as ""he left us Hanging."""
Greg,Fucking Hang
Greg,he was actually super nice
Greg,"but at the same time, he'd better be given that he left us hanging for a week and we ended up handing in slides with a few major mistakes"
Greg,"also, high quality google docs recognizes all of these names except one"
Greg,how does it recognize Sandarusi but not Mallany?
Greg,the glock is better than the deagle because it has more bullets
Greg,Is that why the zeus is the worst weapon
Greg,
Greg,yeah
Greg,thats why you never buy armour
Greg,it has 0 bullets
Greg,True
Greg,Yo
Greg,You wanna help me code
Greg,Tru
Greg,no
Greg,Go away Jed
Greg,gottem
Greg,what do you need help with?
Greg,"""I don't see why you have such a huge problem with this, it's super common""
""So was the plague."""
Greg,I am making a timer thingy
Greg,in what language tho
Greg,processing
Greg,
Greg,xd
Greg,i would help but i gotta do college apps
Greg,@Sak von Sak help doctor
Greg,You baited me
Greg,but i said no tho
Greg,Baited
Greg,I'm writing a report atm
Greg,big group thing
Greg,Double baited
Greg,can help him later tho
Greg,never used processing tho
Greg,The logic of the code still applies
Greg,chudat fox
Greg,ez
Greg,vs m2k ganon
Greg,Woah
Greg,ye that actually happened
Greg,AND NOW ITS MANGO MARIO VS AXE YUNG LINK
Greg,Of all the days to have a 5-hour group meeting and then go to the gym
Greg,Sounds like I'm missing some hype stuff
Greg,axe op
Greg,why is he sticking to falco
Greg,i dunno
Greg,oh
Greg,nvm
Greg,lets go
Greg,monkaS
Greg,oh
Greg,he did it
Greg,monkas?
Greg,jed was ahead of me
Greg,twitch emote I assume
Greg,
Greg,^monkaS
Greg,that sopo is spicy
Greg,ye boi
Greg,rip chu
Greg,@Jed
Greg,happy birthday tomorrow bro
Greg,Update your steam wish llist
Greg,FeelsBirthdayMan
Greg,
Greg,Happy 17
Greg,but for real update that wishlist boiiii
Greg,I do not require games
Greg,this match is nuts
Greg,I've been thinking and I think its possible we will have more fun at a meetup if we don't go to an event. Does anyone else think this may be the case?
Greg,"the meetup might be more fun, but if I'm paying for travel and a hotel I'd prefer to get both that and an event out of it"
Greg,if we need to schedule it so that we can all come and it doesn't line up with an event I'm fine with that too
Greg,im kinda with max on this one
Greg,but an event would be fun tho
Greg,would it have to be an event with melee tho?
Greg,probably since that is the only game that enough of us play
Greg,also the only game we could enter as well as spectate
Greg,Someone could bring their laptop for rivals?
Greg,I could
Greg,I'm sure someone else could as well for multiple setups
Greg,That's be dope
Greg,Idk if I can come though
Greg,i could prolly run roa on my surface XD
Greg,I could bring mine
Greg,but me being able to go is gonna depend on a whole bunch of stuff
Greg,I'd need to get an internship over the summer and be able to take some time off
Greg,Depends on the price for me
Greg,well we should try to make it happen bois
Greg,we've been planning something like this for 1.5 years now
Greg,agreed
Greg,Yeah I'm saving up to move out though so I have to decide if I'm willing to spend
Greg,And set myself back
Greg,to move out???
Greg,why would you move out
Greg,I'll be 18 in a yeat
Greg,yeah but why would you want to move out
Greg,I'm ready to be independent
Greg,you've got a free home w/ utilities and food and everything
Greg,Yes
Greg,its not ideal but it is super practical
Greg,I mean basically I get rekt if my parents find out
Greg,So if that happens leaving will be necessary
Greg,it's something you should take advantage of until you have a consistent source of money that can cover your rent and food and utilities
Greg,Thats called addiction folks
Greg,Willing to alter your life for a substance
Greg,No
Greg,That's one reason
Greg,also that's not the definition of addiction by a long shot
Greg,^
Greg,addiction is defined by a physical and mental dependance on a substance
Greg,I'm aware thats not the definition
Greg,If I get a roommate or 2 I could cover rent rn
Greg,I'm just ready to be on my own
Greg,"also, just a recommendation, don't just drop this on your family out of the blue"
Greg,Idk my family is great and I love them
Greg,so tell them
Greg,don't make it a surprise
Greg,I will
Greg,or they'll be incredibly pissed
Greg,OR just dont and stay with them
Greg,Breaks over boiz
Greg,breaks?
Greg,I'm loving how all the dreamhack trophies are breaking
Greg,did Hbox's break?
Greg,someone's buying cheap trophies
Greg,yeah
Greg,the base came off
Greg,lol
Greg,https://twitter.com/LiquidHbox/status/922288824620695553
Greg,sigh
Greg,also do you guys think hbox is #1 in world rn?
Greg,yes
Greg,me too
Greg,yeah he's going pretty ham
Greg,also s2j definitely top 10 at this point
Greg,even though I think he's boring
Greg,but do I really wanna play doki doki
Greg,also @Mr. Airplane I was on break at work
Greg,Play it
Greg,Play it
Greg,@The Rona How far are you?
Greg,This is a fun game
Greg,Yuri is coming over to my house today
Greg,hawt
Greg,❤
Greg,I chose Natsuki
Greg,Ew
Greg,We got to make cupcakes
Greg,so this is a dating sim?
Greg,it looks like one but it really isn't
Greg,its a psychological horror game
Greg,It needs to be played blind so don't look up stuff about it
Greg,is it a sound based game?
Greg,smell?
Greg,its a visual novel
Greg,do I need to provide my own blindfold?
Greg,how do I play a visual novel blind?
Greg,bad game design imo
Greg,you really don't need to take that out of context
Greg,yeah
Greg,but it was funny
Greg,btw @The Rona I only chose Natsuki because Sayori wasn't an option. She was my favorite.
Greg,why the heck is everyone so obsessed with Yuri
Greg,shes dumb
Greg,I'm not sure
Greg,Once everyone has completed the game I'm going to make a poll
Greg,Yo I read a book with Yuri ok
Greg,best girl poll?
Greg,She liked my poem
Greg,You do things with whichever girl liked your poem
Greg,So if a different one had you would have done something with her
Greg,shhhhhhhh
Greg,Maybe
Greg,not maybe its a fact
Greg,I wanted Monika but then I realised that she wasn't an option
Greg,;-;
Greg,lol
Greg,@Rivals of Aether someone fight me real quick
Greg,Fuck me this game
Greg,Oh poor doctor
Greg,You ain't seen nothing yet
Greg,how long is the game?
Greg,This just got super weird
Greg,It's a few hours

Greg,Thanks my dude
Greg,Happy birthday @Jed
Greg,Happy birthday!!  @Jed
Greg,they grow up so fast 
Greg,Can it be considered growing up when Kameron's testosterone levels stay negative every year
Greg,"so for a big group project, we have do peer reviews where we basically give all our group members marks based on how good they were, and we have to write a paragraph or so for each of them explaining why we gave those marks"
Greg,which is a pain
Greg,but at least the sample paragraphs are hilarious
Greg,here are a few samples:
Greg,"""Candorsnaffity Hixelbröd was an annoying teammate"""
Greg,"""he agreed that he'd do the sushi-ionization module by Sunday afternoon"""
Greg,"""Prosnitau Sgrachita de la Mnirhoihoi was good, helpful and co-operative."""
Greg,"""V'snl'chm'tkn!k of the Fortress of Doom (that's me) was an effective worker in this
assignment"""
Greg,"also I just skimmed over the way you're supposed to break down marks (that I totally ignored initially), which contains this gem: A mark of seven indicates someone who leaps tall buildings in a single bound, walks on water, and solves NP-complete problems in linear time."
Greg,@here gamerinos anyone???
Greg,Yee
Greg,@Sak von Sak play dem games with me and birthday boi
Greg,@Max you too
Greg,gotta finish these stupid peer reviews
Greg,just do it later
Greg,boom problem solved
Greg,it's due tonight
Greg,I already left it to the last minute
Greg,Doki Doki is okie doki
Greg,     
Greg,same
Greg,"My stats prof: ""Just then, you assumed that I was telling the truth, because what I was saying was plausible.  Just like how you assume I have the credentials to teach this course."""
Greg,Same
Greg,The teachers are on strike where I live and i am not getting compensation for the missed school even though i paid for it if you guys can take like 1 minutes jsut to fill out this petition giving students compensation for missed days i will personally suck your dick and give you a high five at the same time https://www.change.org/p/college-employer-council-students-demand-a-tuition-refund-for-each-day-missed-in-case-of-an-ontario-college-strike/nftexp/ex15/v6/818679301?recruiter=818679301&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial.combo_new_control_progress_bar&utm_content=ex15%3Av6
Greg,Sign the Petition
Greg,College Employer Council: Students demand a tuition refund for each day missed in case of an Ontario college strike
Greg,damn they're on strike again?
Greg,"not as sure about college profs, but for uni and high school they have an insanely good setup"
Greg,"as in high pay, low hours, good benefits"
Greg,and they still strike
Greg,"the people a year older than me got screwed for uni applications cause the public school board teachers aren't legally allowed to strike, so the union just strongarmed all the teachers into stopping extracurriculars so basically everyone who was applying to post-secondary stuff had a big empty extracurricular section on all their applications"
Greg,the worst part is that most teachers didn't even want to do it but you can't teach in a public school without being part of the union so they had no choice
Greg,and the union's pretty screwed up even when no one's going on strike
Greg,"one of the major things is that your ability to get placed where you want is based 100% on seniority, so if you're an awful teacher who's been around for 30 years you can teach what you want, where you want, and if you're a brand new teacher living paycheck to paycheck you probably can't even get a job"
Greg,"one of my uncles has been a teacher for six years, he couldn't get a job for the first three years except as a substitute teacher or an LTO (long term occasional, basically if a teacher goes on maternity or sick leave for awhile he would come in and pick up a poorly documented class for a few months then he'd be out of a job again), then he got a really good slot for a year.... only to get kicked out by someone with more seniority and he had to spend the next two years at a place for kids who've been expelled or are in juvie but can't technically not get school (read: everyone's an asshole and/or doesn't give a fuck and it's in the middle of a super dangerous area) before he's finally managed to get a decent placement and who knows how long that's gonna last, cause based on their system by the end of the year he'll only have 4 years of seniority"
Greg,Teachers unions are just terrible
Greg,Looks like we agree on one more thing
Greg,"some unions are alright, especially in dangerous jobs (like factory work), but a) unions in public funded areas are generally terrible cause they're fairly essential services where it has a large, negative impact on society if and when they strike, b) teachers already have a pretty damn cushy gig and really, really don't need a union, and c) this union in particular has a tendancy to kinda sorta work against the best interests of its members in an attempt to make things marginally better for a small handful of them"
Greg,holy shit
Greg,I leave this chat for a couple weeks and come back to find deep discussion on politics
Greg,nice
Greg,Welcome back
Greg,hey boys
Greg,yee
Greg,@Max
Greg,how is mcg development going?
Greg,Its going good
Greg,Is there a new build I could play tonight?
Greg,ooh ooh play with me later
Greg,I was planning on patching it soon
Greg,maybe I can get the new build together today
Greg,yes @Sak von Sak
Greg,I can't now tho
Greg,just took an hour-long melee break
Greg,and I've got a midterm at 7
Greg,is anyone here getting destiny 2? It looks kinda gay but im down if you guys get it
Greg,oh
Greg,rip
Greg,how difficult are exams?
Greg,also @Max @Sak von Sak college life is crazy
Greg,gotta love it though
Greg,I just took a midterm and it was pretty easy
Greg,"I'm not that worried, I've done a ton of old midterms and I basically know every questions he's gonna throw at me"
Greg,we're allowed a cheat sheet too
Greg,thats OP
Greg,I want a cheat sheet
Greg,honestly I'm usually more worried about tests where they let you have a cheat sheet
Greg,cause that means it's hard
Greg,true
Greg,"and it's gonna be more questions testing your understanding and application than your knowledge, which is really all the cheat sheet helps with"
Greg,I got a cheat sheet for my math midterm and I didn't even need it
Greg,@Trapezoider Even if I don't make a new build today the build we are on will be new for you
Greg,@Trapezoider you should get a copy of the cards and make a few decks before we play
Greg,I sent him the pdf
Greg,"just to warn him tho, there's a few cards with two versions in the pdf (at least if it's the same one I've got) and a bunch of unimplemented/banned cards"
Greg,woah
Greg,"from what I remember, knight, scholar, goblin, and berserker are banned atm due to being more than a little OP, there's two versions of stasis chamber (I think the actual one is the one with 1 attack), two grand arbiters (3-cost one is the real one), wild magic is banned, power cultivation might be banned, replicator is banned or at the very least it's getting removed next patch, time walk shouldn't exist anymore, and once there stop being pictures for stuff everything unimplemented"
Greg,at least in my version
Greg,Power cultivation isn't banned
Greg,He has the same version as you @Sak von Sak
Greg,oh I thought it was
Greg,my bad
Greg,Tonights games will probably be the final testing before 1.18 is implemented
Greg,I found another good wrastor
Greg,he wrecked me the first few games but I brought it back
Greg,The mythical good wrastor player
Greg,many deny the very existence of such a player
Greg,@Sak von Sak @Trapezoider @me when you want to play MCG and I'll set up the server
Greg,"I just finished my midterm, I'm gonna get a pizza (which will put me over budget for the week but fuck it I deserve a pizza) and then I'm down to play"
Greg,"it won't actually put me much over budget cause pizza pizza has a clutch deal - large pizza, 3 toppings, dipping sauce, $13 including tax"
Greg,and I can just bring the couple of leftover slices for lunch tomorrow and save some there
Greg,pizza pizza coming in clutch
Greg,@Trapezoider fight me mcg
Greg,@Trapezoider you're letting me down
Greg,@here games?
Greg,I'm waiting on @Trapezoider to come play mcg with me

Greg,@Sak von Sak I think I've figured out a better way to deal with your trap from yesterday
Greg,there's a lot of good ways around it
Greg,but even if you block it I force you to waste a turn blocking it
Greg,and I get at least a knight and a bishop out
Greg,Raven ate the entire stem off of one of our pumpkins lol
Greg,Eww
Greg,Why did you just call her Raven?
Greg,ha
Greg,thats my dog's name
Greg,Oh
Greg,No that's Ava
Greg,Stop lying
Greg,I didn't mean Ava if some of you thought that
Greg,We all know she craves pumpkin stems
Greg,I totally thought you meant Ava
Greg,lololol
Greg,Yeah me too
Greg,I was pretty sure you meant ava
Greg,did ava name herself after the dog or the dog after ava?
Greg,Ava named her online alias after the dog

Greg,God bless my architecture prof and his wonderful curves
Greg,I live to study another day
Greg,"I finally finished persona 5 last night, man that was a game"
Greg,"Indeed, it is a game"
Greg,"I'm still cracking up that I told kameron I was halfway through the final boss at around 830, which was 100% true, and the game wasn't actually over until 11"
Greg,game's ending was longer than most movies
Greg,and it made me feel a lot of things
Greg,That's like the ending of Pokemon sun and moon
Greg,most of them good
Greg,I hate it when you think you are gonna beat a game
Greg,Then the ending takes a million hours
Greg,And you end up staying up all night
Greg,god the ending was so good though
Greg,@undertale
Greg,I wouldn't have cut any of it out
Greg,It's like 30+ minutes of unskipable cutscenes
Greg,this was about two hours
Greg,two glorious hours
Greg,What game is it sylki?
Greg,Nice
Greg,scroll up a wee bit
Greg,you'll see
Greg,Persona 5 you drunk
Greg,Sorry
Greg,I was thinking about rough completion times for most rpgs
Greg,and it's like
Greg,pokemon: 20-30 hours
Greg,chrono trigger: 30-35
Greg,chrono cross: 50ish
Greg,@bois I'm becoming a PI today. Get to go investigate a sketchy corp and acquire police reports and records from the capitol of my state
Greg,xenobladeX: 65
Greg,persona 3: 75
Greg,@wolfstein 20
Greg,xenoblade: 80
Greg,"persona 5, according to my game file, 94 hours"
Greg,that is insane
Greg,Those are looking like my CSGO hours
Greg,Except mine are like +60
Greg,So
Greg,Not that close actually
Greg,"at least on steam, the only games I've played more than 94 hours are tf2, csgo, and rivals"
Greg,"seriously though, incredible game"
Greg,and all I want to do is start again
Greg,try and get all the stuff I missed
Greg,WHOS HYPED FOR NEW WOLFENSTEIN
Greg,I didn't play the first one
Greg,there's a whole bunch
Greg,Oh
Greg,I've played none of them
Greg,I have also played none of them
Greg,"one of my favourite things about studying is coming up with really, really shitty acronyms for things, only for them to actually be useful if only because I'm amused by how terrible they are"
Greg,I sometimes make acronyms too
Greg,"current highlights are SDVE (pronounced like ""Steve""), and SCURP (which is just fun to say)"
Greg,bonus points to myself for figuring out the Steve thing cause the acronym has to be in that order
Greg,nice
Greg,@Rivals of Aether @Cs:go games?
Greg,fuuuuck I missed it
Greg,"m2k's in toronto for canada cup, showed up to a weekly"
Greg,grands was poop m2k

Greg,from what I can see m2k went pichu and won 3-0

Greg,why am I like this
Greg,yur dumb
Greg,"it's like, five or six hours in a nearly hundred hour game is not all that long, and when's the next time I'm gonna have the opportunity to a) choose first and last name for a characters, and b) have the name 'Locke' be thematically appropriate?"
Greg,"I'm not gonna do it, cause those five or six wasted hours aren't worth the shitty joke"
Greg,I'll save it for if I ever run a rogue in D&D
Greg,"lol ""Guys, the audio seems delayed because light travels faster than sound. The stream is coming from Canada so the difference in speed is magnified."""
Greg,real talk the canada cup stream is messed up in so many ways right now

Greg,that was sick
Greg,and n0ne's playing crazy too
Greg,but he's against armada so he's still losing
Greg,he's moving tho
Greg,that was depressing
Greg,n0ne's offense was incredible
Greg,but armada's defense was even better
Greg,"like n0ne was moving insanely fast and getting really neat followups but anything that wasn't 100% guarunteed just wasn't hitting, ever"
Greg,"welp kage's getting m2k, rip canada"
Greg,@here games?
Greg,
Greg,essential if youère gonna be in this server
Greg,heh
Greg,I mean
Greg,okay

Greg,you didn't give it to yourself lol
Greg,I gave it to him

Greg,poor kage's got his third straight sheik after this
Greg,did he play gay sheiks before?
Greg,kirbykaze then android
Greg,"3-1, 3-1"
Greg,but now he's got m2k
Greg,who is a very different beast
Greg,Did you not get his joke?
Greg,prolly ignored cause it was a dumb joke
Greg,oh lol
Greg,that took me a few seconds
Greg,my god they're both nuts
Greg,that was way closer than I was expecting
Greg,"and then n0ne just kinda goes ""oh shit it's game five last stock, better turn up"""
Greg,honestly kage did better than I expected
Greg,lolol they're singing him happy birthday
Greg,"well top 4 is gonna be hype : armada, leffen, m2k, n0ne"
Greg,"lolol street fighter is doing crews, the grand finals is Team Japan 2 vs Team Japan 3"
Greg,"street fighter crews seem weird cause nothing carries over between matches, so it's entirely plausible to just send out your best player first and have them sweep the whole other crew"
Greg,rip n0ne
Greg,that poof kill was so sad
Greg,I'm personally glad to see m2k re-mastering his vs falcon game
Greg,"cause n0ne kept it even all the way till that, and was outplaying him after it, but he died at like 40% and he wasn't playing well enough to bring it all the way back"
Greg,I honestly don't feel like m2k was playing that particularly well
Greg,yo m2k with the quick classic - weak upsmash to tipper fsmash
Greg,Good to see the player I always copy copying me for once
Greg,yo that was awesome
Greg,M2K catches the close range stitch and kills armada with it
Greg,YESSSSSS
Greg,4th time
Greg,that was quite the pop off
Greg,first time ever in a game 5
Greg,he just vanished from the playercam for a good 5-10 seconds
Greg,I missed the stitch catch tho and that makes me sad
Greg,i dont think that there is any doubt now that hbox > armada
Greg,are leffen and plup gonna surpass the other 3 gods tho?
Greg,m2k pogchamp
Greg,m2k's feeling himself
Greg,hopefully he can keep it up for both sets
Greg,I think if he wins it would be his biggest win of all time
Greg,WHAT
Greg,THESE TECS
Greg,Repeat of the 6-0 meme?
Greg,OH MY GAWSH
Greg,HES CRAZY
Greg,He is definitely above plup this year if he wins
Greg,who?
Greg,m2k
Greg,leffen or m2k
Greg,possibly also leffen
Greg,"i mean, plup beat leffen like 4 times"
Greg,h2h doesn't really matter as much in melee
Greg,chu is up 4-1 vs m2k but no one says he should outrank him
Greg,this is true
Greg,good god m2k's going ham
Greg,60-40 XD
Greg,NA crowd
Greg,imo its 50-50
Greg,i know the crowd is chanting 60-40
Greg,it's weirdly stage dependant tho
Greg,yeah I heard
Greg,FD it's like 65-35 for marth
Greg,dream land 60-40 fox
Greg,"it seems like except for hbox, the top 6 is really a toss up right now"
Greg,m2k's going haaaaaaam
Greg,calm down m2k
Greg,Lets go 6-0
Greg,DAT UPSMASH THO
Greg,lol there's one guy cheering for leffen in the crowd
Greg,rip 6-0 dream
Greg,i cry 
Greg,bad melee

Greg,Was this the conservative girl?
Greg,well
Greg,politcally conservative yes
Greg,You know what I meant
Greg,yeah was clarifying
Greg,Welcome back
Greg,this was the girl who seemed kinda sketchy about the whole relationships thing?
Greg,she just kinda ignored me all the time
Greg,after I asked her out
Greg,"(on an unrelated note, someone in the crowd for sfv at canada cup has a massive sign that just says 'SORRY')"
Greg,yeah that seems like a good call
Greg,she didn't ignore me when I said we were done though
Greg,and she sent a snap of her drinking with some dude
Greg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Greg,lol
Greg,Don't respond
Greg,FeelsBadMan
Greg,No
Greg,"I think that's supposed to be a ""I don't need you"" kinda thing"
Greg,That's what your supposed to feel
Greg,which is a massive dick move
Greg,but seeing as you kinda already figured she didn't give much of a fuck about you
Greg,hopefully it's not as bad
Greg,I know I made the right choice and had good reasons but I still feel bad
Greg,"not for her, just bad in general"
Greg,I know that feel
Greg,relationships are weird
Greg,^
Greg,akwardly sits with absolutely nothing to add
Greg,it's honestly made me kinda hesitant to try em out again
Greg,should probably try to get over that
Greg,"also max, you're at college give it a shot"
Greg,There is no one good
Greg,fair
Greg,I feel that
Greg,but you should at least try to make some friends
Greg,No one good... yet
Greg,there prolly is
Greg,you just always find the bad ones first
Greg,that's the best way to find people imo
Greg,damn apparently people sponsored by echo fox won all the smash events at canada cup

It wasn't supposed to be like that but the deck I was against prevented me from winning in any other manner"

Greg,"On a rainy morning in Tokyo, Takao Akizuki, an aspiring shoemaker, decides to skip class to sketch designs in a beautiful garden. This is where he meets Yukari Yukino, a beautiful yet mysterious woman, for the very first time. Offering to make her new shoes, Takao continues to meet with Yukari throughout the rainy season, and without even realizing it, the two are able to alleviate the worries hidden in their hearts just by being with each other. However, their personal struggles have not disappeared completely, and as the end of the rainy season approaches, their relationship will be put to the test. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Greg,"To the outside world, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are the perfect couple. But in reality, they just share the same secret pain: they are both in love with other people they cannot be with. Hanabi has loved her childhood friend and neighbor Narumi Kanai for as long as she can remember, so she is elated to discover that he is her new homeroom teacher. However, Narumi is soon noticed by the music teacher, Akane Minagawa, and a relationship begins to blossom between them, much to Hanabi's dismay. Mugi was tutored by Akane in middle school, and has been in love with her since then. Through a chance meeting in the hallway, he encounters Hanabi. As these two lonely souls spend more time together, they decide to use each other as a substitute for the one they truly love, sharing physical intimacy with one another in order to stave off their loneliness.

Greg,"Haruhi Fujioka is a bright scholarship candidate with no rank or title to speak of—a rare species at Ouran High School, an elite academy for students of high pedigree. When she opens the door to Music Room #3 hoping to find a quiet place to study, Haruhi unexpectedly stumbles upon the Host Club. Led by the princely Tamaki, the club—whose other members include the ""Shadow King"" Kyouya, the mischievous Hitachiin twins, and the childlike Haninozuka ""Honey"" and his strong protector Mori—is where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls in the academy. In a frantic attempt to remove herself from the hosts, Haruhi ends up breaking a vase worth eight million yen and is forced into becoming the eccentric group's general errand boy to repay her enormous debt. However, thanks to her convincingly masculine appearance, her naturally genial disposition toward girls, and fascinating commoner status, she is soon promoted to full-time male host and plunged headlong into a glitzy whirlwind of elaborate cosplays, rich food, and exciting shenanigans that only the immensely wealthy Ouran Host Club can pull off.

Greg,Great Teacher Onizuka
Greg,"Onizuka is a reformed biker gang leader who has his sights set on an honorable new ambition: to become the world's greatest teacher... for the purpose of meeting sexy high school girls. Okay, so he's mostly reformed. However, strict administrators and a class of ruthless delinquents stand between Onizuka and his goal and they will use any means, however illegal or low, to drive the new teacher away. Perfect, because Onizuka's methods won't be found in any teaching manual; he cares about the difference between legal and illegal activities about as much as he cares for the age difference between himself and a high school girl. So get ready for math that doesn't add up, language you'd be slapped for using, and biology that would make a grown man blush... unless of course, you're the Great Teacher Onizuka.

Greg,My car fishtailed and I flew into a freeway and got boned at the front of my car. I then proceeded to do a 360 then fly back into the exit
Greg,And block the lane
Greg,Just got home
Greg,I should be dead

Greg,I gotta bike now :)
Greg,Ye I'm just glad I'm alive kameron
Greg,@everyone in case I spontaneously die thank you all for imporving the quality of my life the last 2 years. You guys are great
Greg,fishtailed means that someone hit the back of your car right?
Greg,um
Greg,should we be worried?
Greg,he got in car crash
Greg,"I got that part, was mostly worried that there might be something in the aftermath"
Greg,but I guess he meant more in the general case of if he dies cause unforseen circumstances
Greg,Yes
Greg,not sudoku
Greg,I'm very aware right now. Of how fragile life is
Greg,@Sak von Sak have you been in a car crasherino?
Greg,I got hit by a bus while on my bike once
Greg,How did you not die.exe?
Greg,"and I distinctly remember falling towards the side/wheels, and thinking ""SHIT""  and then ""Come on man, if you die here, is that really the last thing you want to think?"""
Greg,Then what :0
Greg,and then some 30-120 second gap in my memory
Greg,next thing I remember is propped up against a building on the side of the road with all the people I was with gathered in a terrified semi-circle around me
Greg,and being sooooo deep in shock
Greg,We're you injured?
Greg,"I survived by not getting hit on, I swerved, my back wheel popped up and I spun into the side then fell off, then.... something"
Greg,"nothing serious, my knees have been even more screwey ever since"
Greg,"he ended up running over my bike, thought he'd run me over and was honestly the most relieved person in the whole event"
Greg,I still have the decimated bike seat
Greg,How long ago was this
Greg,"summer after grade 10, so.... 5 years ago?"

Greg,pubg?
Greg,Leffen got possibly the hardest bracket possible
Greg,yeah thats what the casters just said xd
Greg,Mango>Plup>Armada>Hbox
Greg,"bruh if leffen was on the other side of the bracket, then this would be ez tourney 4 plup"
Greg,now its ez tourney for hbox
Greg,unless big leff goes ham
Greg,but i dont think that plup can win the tourney anymore
Greg,Since leffen won't kill hbox for him?
Greg,ye
Greg,unless mango beats hbox in winners and big leff beats him in losers
Greg,but that prolly wont happen
Greg,ez 4 the box
Greg,"full predictions: hbox 3-0 SFAT, Mango 3-1 Axe, Armada 3-2 wizzy, plup 3-2 leff, hbox 3-1 mango, plup 3-2 armada, hbox 3-0 plup"
Greg,I think armada wizzy will be a 3-0
Greg,yeah you're prolly right
Greg,hbox 4-stock pogchamp
Greg,so much for the 3-0
Greg,3-2 ecksdee
Greg,but my preds are already wrong
Greg,i thought axe's yung link would beat mango's mario
Greg,but it didnt
Greg,you still have gotten set winners correct
Greg,^
Greg,lets go wizy
Greg,can he do it
Greg,hes going ham
Greg,but i have to root against him
Greg,I don't think plup beating armada was the streak being broken because plup was top 6 at then time
Greg,If wizy wins its truely over
Greg,Why do you need to root against wizy?
Greg,for da predictions
Greg,your predictions are not worth the hype of armada losing to a non top 6
Greg,maybe 3-0 at that
Greg,yeah but upsets are only interesting in the short term
Greg,I think if the armada slump continues he will retire
Greg,look at armada's face
Greg,he looks depressed
Greg,yeah
Greg,I think he is actually gonna cry
Greg,CHOKE
Greg,armada is back
Greg,rip the dream
Greg,NOOOOOOOOOOO
Greg,that ending
Greg,wizzy beat himself that set
Greg,alright time for the classic salty leff v plup
Greg,what happened? I missed the end
Greg,wizzy sd'd
Greg,aw
Greg,this match is lit
Greg,real lit
Greg,the plup samus coming out?
Greg,well rip
Greg,I'm going to be studying that game later
Greg,honestly it was a pretty questionable choice
Greg,the commentators weren't lying when they said it's her worst stage in the matchup
Greg,I know
Greg,FD is my ban
Greg,lets go leffen
Greg,From my experience Sheik is even worse on FD
Greg,sizable leff

Greg,whenever someone leaves anything in the wahsre or dryer here it just ends up on the floor
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL
Greg,our floor is horrifyingly disgusting
Greg,cause our basement is just concrete and we never go down there expect to do laundry
Greg,and if I left it on the floor they'd have to clean it again and I'm not that heartless
Greg,"one time at my school I saw someone walk into the laundry room, take their load out of the washer, then found a dryer with the most amount of time on it. they just took out someone elses laundy and tossed it on the floor"
Greg,so they got a free dryer
Greg,that is amazing

Greg,Nah
Greg,"I dont really know what hard drugs are, whats a DRUG?"
Greg,the only good experience I've had related to hard drugs is listening to a very drunk friend trying to describe what it's like to be on salvia
Greg,lol  sylki thinks salvia is a hard drug
Greg,i did salvia when i was 2
Greg,I mean from his description it sounded pretty insane

Greg,"I wish, but I don't have the game. LOL"

Greg,sure why not
Greg,can confirm: drunk crew battles are the hypest shit on the planet
Greg,Is this IRL or on a stream?
Greg,irl
Greg,some of the worst melee you've ever seen
Greg,but hype as shit
Greg,I got the fastest semi-legit zero to death of my life
Greg,"start of match, got drill shined, tried to cc downsmash but his shine pushed me off stage so it got treated as buffered dair, but he messed up his waveshine and also went off stage, right into my dair and died from it"
Greg,also no one has any ability to maintain reasonable composure
Greg,a guy got in my head by talking about the midterm we both did earlier in the day
Greg,"""Yo what architecture style did you use? you'd better of used pipe & filter or you probably failed.""
""I didn't use pipe and filter""
""Damn son you are FUUUUUUCKED"""
Greg,missing one question means you fail?
Greg,100 mark test
Greg,66 mark question
Greg,I stand by my choice of style tho
Greg,is this the one where failing means you fail the course?
Greg,yeah
Greg,but I'm pretty sure implicit invocation will work jsut fine
Greg,so missing that one question will cost you the course
Greg,hypothetically
Greg,but there's a lot of bits
Greg,getting the wrong style won't make me fail
Greg,also I'm pretty sure my style is just as valid
Greg,if you care for a slightly more coherant answer ask me tomorrow
Greg,okay
Greg,"@Rotomotorz REMINDER IN CASE YOU MISSED MY FIRST MESSAGE: Andrew's address is 15631 Quince Trace Terrace, be there by 7:50"

Greg,i vote mrd
Greg,also there's not really a 'top' for this kind of thing
Greg,or dadlast
Greg,mrd tried to cheat in mcg yesterday
Greg,lawful good just means you follow a strict code of ethics that is generally good
Greg,"also my quote is wrong. It should be ironically ""My only goal in life is to respect all whamen"
Greg,more like put your dick in all of them  am I right
Greg,nah
Greg,that is not optimal
Greg,"I personally believe that the way I behave as a person makes be the best possible fit for lawful good, although I think my dad could fit it too, we just didn't put him on the chart because he isn't really a part of this server."
Greg,I'm with max on this one

Greg,as soon as I saw that there was an alignment chart the only two ones I knew for sure were max on lawful good and kameron on true neutral

Greg,you can buy that on steam
Greg,and I know we have the disc somewhere I just can't find it and I'm lazy
Greg,yeah I can
Greg,or he could not
Greg,but I already own the game
Greg,and save money on a game his dad owns
Greg,then go look for it
Greg,mighta got lost when we moved a couple years ago
Greg,lol rip
Greg,but if I already purchased the game once
Greg,is it wrong for me to download it somewhere else
Greg,I mean I would probably buy it since its really cheap but in this case I say do what you want
Greg,its $10
Greg,thats nothing
Greg,rich boi
Greg,yeah it is
Greg,$ 10 bucks
Greg,thats like a third tank of gas
Greg,I mean I'm not buying it again  just asking what you though
Greg,*1/4 a tank
Greg,not for meeeee
Greg,i fill up for 30
Greg,then you have a smaller tank
Greg,ye
Greg,but I can go a week+
Greg,so its guchi
Greg,"builds a new gaming pc to play good looking games, spends hours on a game from 2005"
Greg,is retarded
Greg,boys lets play some gaymes
Greg,isn't a mooch ;)
Greg,Pirates is a good game
Greg,
Greg,ooh but what do I name myself tho
Greg,also English ftw
Greg,My name will be Carl Okson
Greg,KArl
Greg,@Max
Greg,yeah?
Greg,I motion for an amendment of the allignment chart
Greg,"I say bitmin should be chaotic evil, and I should be neutral evil"
Greg,I suggested that but Ava insisted it stay how it is
Greg,Facsism is worse than ironically disrespecting whamen
Greg,"also he says ""kind of"" a facist"
Greg,I DID NOT
Greg,also its just a joke so it doesn't really matter
Greg,I'll change yours if you can come up with something better that still fits chaotic neutral
Greg,
Greg,Love this game
Greg,"How dare you attack English ships! For whatever reason, when I played that game I never attacked the English (I was English myself)."
Greg,I don't
Greg,oh is that your fleet?
Greg,Yes
Greg,rip
Greg,Glory to the crown
Greg,get to a port
Greg,Nah I had to divide the plunder
Greg,Am rebuolding
Greg,I'm already an English duke
Greg,nice
Greg,difficulty?
Greg,The third one up I think? I've been advancing each time I divide plunder
Greg,"If faschism were the measure for making someone ""evil"", which I don't think it is (but thats sorta besides the point), wouldent that be characterised closer to lawful ""evil"" rather than chaotic ""evil"" seeing as it usually leads to rules set in place that are very strict and follow a more lawful form of lifestyle or government(regardless of whether its better or not) rather than chaotic ?"
Greg,I agree with this reasoning
Greg,well since I'm lawful with the real law I get lawful evil
Greg,"lawful evil just means you follow a set of guidelines, not necessarily the law"
Greg,"a mass murderer who only kills blond men under 5'3"" is lawful evil"
Greg,a law-abiding asshole who's just generally a dick to everyone would not be lawful evil (probably neutral evil)
Greg,idk how much i agree with that
Greg,"having a standard for who you murder isnt exactly ""lawful"""
Greg,"among the two of us, I'm the one who's actually played D&D"
Greg,and has had the alignments explained in a lot of detail
Greg,"oh, does it?"
Greg,did not kn o w
Greg,well its too late and its a meme anyway
Greg,"lawful normally aligns with the law (particularly lawful good), but that's mainly due to the law being a pre-existing set of moral rules"
Greg,"chaotic generally is following your instincts for good/evil, not having a 'code' that you follow, and placing more value on an individual's choice"
Greg,the whole lawful vs chaotic thing can also be framed in terms of order vs freedom
Greg,
Greg,Facism as a social system has only brought suffering and death to the masses
Greg,"things I learned today: there is a toronto melee player whose tag is 'DACDACBRUCE', a tag that makes even less sense when you realize that his actual name is jonathan"
Greg,Guys it's cornpop
Greg,ew

Greg,and im like bruh why do i gotta Sim is its not like stat weights change from person to person
Greg,"and these mongs are like ""yeah that do"" like shit thought we were playing hte same class forgot blizzard made it so everyones class is different depending on whos playing it"
Greg,"and then later some guy in the discord got an achievement and i said Grats and these mongs are all like ""oh look whos back bet he wants to know the stat weights again"""
Greg,like these fucking monkeys
Greg,go play ret pally get off feral im surprised you even have the brain power to operate this spec
Greg,you dont get that last part
Greg,dw basically ret paladin is for braindead monkeys and feral is the hardest spec in the game to play
Greg,I understand nothing you just said
Greg,Stat whore
Greg,:p
Greg,bruh i jsut wanted to setup my pawn so it would tell me what gear is better

Greg,Then we all get assigned someone
Greg,"Who we make a gift box for, for a set amount of money"
Greg,Then mail it off in time for Christmas
Greg,I'd be down
Greg,I think it would be nice because we all know what most of us like and could make cool gift boxes
Greg,Ye me too. @Sak von Sak you in Philip medianson?
Greg,maybe
Greg,depends how many people we get
Greg,yee
Greg,"I'll ask Ava, max, doc, and chikonN tonight"

Greg,Salt has infused itself with my dna
Greg,
Greg,Fuck me 
Greg,That's your chance
Greg,slide into those DMs
Greg,No
Greg,Is this your ex or something?
Greg,no
Greg,here's the story
Greg,this chick on halloween was dared to kiss me during truth or dare
Greg,and she did and she was like apologizing a bunch about it bein awkward
Greg,and I was the one who was driving her home and so like in my car she was still talking about it XD and I said well oh we'll have to try it again sometime then
Greg,so after that we talk a lot over snapchat and hang out at school and stuff
Greg,and then 2 fridays ago we hung out outside of school and before I took her home we kinda just looked at each other and made out
Greg,so that was chill everything was good
Greg,after that we talked about where we were at and I said I wanted to go out with her but she said she wasn't ready for a relationship yet but that she wanted to date me
Greg,so i was like chill I can wait
Greg,fast forward to this last friday
Greg,was 10/10 stoned with trap and another friend
Greg,I was talking with her and sent a snap that said I really like you or something like that
Greg,and she responds with a long ass snap about how she isn't ready for a relationship and that she couldn't ever see us being more than friends
Greg,and then today she posted that
Greg,"also, saturday she went back to snapping me like we never even had the conversation"
Greg,idk lifes a bitch
Greg,"no, she is xd"
Greg,Women are weird sometimes my dude
Greg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Greg,Yo
Greg,hit her up
Greg,be like
Greg,what's the deal
Greg,??
Greg,see if I do that she's gonna be all pissy and be like oh I thought you were more mature than that
Greg,I'm probably gonna end up doing that tho
Greg,haha true
Greg,we'll see how high I get
Greg,woah
Greg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Greg,"Yo just man up, do it without the green"
Greg,I'm not sure if I want to lose the friendship tho
Greg,Idk man
Greg,Low-key wanna comment in her post like then just go get a boyfriend there are lots of guys it there right?
Greg,@The Rona is that roast good enough?
Greg,It's not terrible
Greg,Make sure that you have every word spelt correctly though if you do post that
Greg,
Greg,I feel like it's just passive aggressive enough to get away with
Greg,I'm bouta fuck myself over prolly but it's finr
Greg,Yeah who cares
Greg,The only reason that the friendship exists in the first place is because of romantic interest
Greg,"Without that, there's not really a point is there?"
Greg,I guess the eventual hopes of her liking me again is the main motive
Greg,"That's probably the hardest part, not gonna lie"
Greg,I'ma comment it
Greg,Whatever happens happens
Greg,I say go for it
Greg,She could either see it as funny and hit you up or see you as a dick
Greg,So
Greg,It's done
Greg,It's whatever
Greg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Greg,Life goes on
Greg,haha
Greg,C'est la vie
Greg,Lmao the response is already in 
Greg,No way
Greg,"""I don't appreciate your salty ass comment"""
Greg,I haven't opened it yet but that's what it says
Greg,Did she dm that to you?
Greg,Yeah over snap
Greg,How do you know what it says??
Greg,Gonna bring up not ready for a relationship probably
Greg,If you don't slide it all the way you can read the right most text
Greg,I see
Greg,"It would have been kinda funny if you commented ""Sorry, I'm not ready for a relationship"" "
Greg,Yours was better though
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Damn she's gonna block me from her sinsta
Greg,Rip
Greg,Oh well
Greg,At least my music is lit
Greg,people who block over stupid things are honestly the worst
Greg,But she is the best
Greg,;~;
Greg,Okay but she probably isn't the best but for some reason I think she is and I feel like doing dumb shit like commenting will make her not be my friend anymore
Greg,And maybe I will stop being obsessed with her if I have a reason to be angry at her
Greg,Jed
Greg,This is what dating Hatcher felt like. Don't get cucked buddy. She may seem like the best thing on Earth right now. But she's being a huge jerk. Stand up for yourself and don't take shit from anyone
Greg,"Yeah, if she acts this petty over one little comment, she ain't worth your time"
Greg,Please help save net neutrality https://www.battleforthenet.com
Greg,Comcast wants to control what you do online. Do you want to let them?

Greg,Yeah

Greg,Yo the punisher is lit
Greg,Yee
Greg,I'm on episode 7
Greg,"While doing research for an essay I'm writing, I came across an idea which is so simple yet I believe could revolutionize the way our government works and I had to share it. What if we made all political donations fully anonymous. If you want to see the full article, PM me with your email addess and I'll send it to you."
Greg,Wow that sounds like a great idea
Greg,why can't you just link the article
Greg,@foreinggovernmentswhowoulddonatebillionstofundnationalpolicythrouhgcandtidatestheyliked
Greg,its on a scholarly database which is restricted
Greg,"basic reasoning behind why that doesn't work is the 'anonymous' bit - the politician just sees the money, not who its from or any messages"
Greg,Can you give me the rundown of how this would affect the government?
Greg,and anyone could claim to have been the donator and there's no real way to prove who it actually was
Greg,helps stop people from giving politicians monetary incentive to support or oppose legislature
Greg,"don't feel like rewriting the article or debating it rn, just PM me your email if you want it"
Greg,"Send me the article max and I will see if I agree with this.. It sounds like an interesting notion, although my natural reaction is to oppose this."
Greg,I will read it tomorrow
Greg,I NEED YOUR EMAIL FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME
Greg,You have my email dork from google docs
Greg,On all the stuff we have collaborated on
Greg,andrewjp42@gmail.com
Greg,Like atlanta docs last year
Greg,also is atlanta 2.0 still on?
Greg,it would be DC
Greg,when?
Greg,summer 2018
Greg,no more detail currently
Greg,@Mr. Airplanes house?
Greg,thats the goal
Greg,okay
Greg,keep me informed
Greg,I need to procure certain amounts of funds into my savings account
Greg,yeah cause I need to start looking at costs now
Greg,@Mr. Airplane
Greg,make us some waffles
Greg,please
Greg,❤
Greg,pancakes are better
Greg,@Mr. Airplane make us pancakes instead
Greg,proper waffles are better imo
Greg,FALSE
Greg,they hold toppings way better
Greg,I'm more into crepes
Greg,#teampancake
Greg,waffles are superior
Greg,crepes are pretty damn good
Greg,@Sak von Sak dont let them decieve you
Greg,#team crepes
Greg,waffles are good but theres nothing better than a big fluffy sweet pancake
Greg,but in the waffles vs pancakes debate waffles are clearly superior
Greg,n0
Greg,yes
Greg,waffles >= crepes > pancakes
Greg,"but like,,"
Greg,you cant cook things into waffles
Greg,"@Trapezoider We have not had a proper conversation on meaningful topics in a long time, you should join up discord for games/discussion more often."
Greg,yeah you totally can
Greg,itll be all burnt n gross
Greg,http://www.strawpoll.me/14455790
Greg,Which is better?
Greg,Vote Now! [Waffles] [Pancakes]
Greg,never happened to me
Greg,
Greg,I prefer to eat lunch food anyways
Greg,@Max
Greg,pancakes have superior texture and flavor
Greg,I concur
Greg,not a fan of breakfast food
Greg,false
Greg,PICK ONE THO MAX
Greg,flavour? they're like 99% the exact same ingredients
Greg,Can we objecitvely prove which is better?
Greg,pancakes
Greg,OH SHIT FAMILY BETRAYAL
Greg,if we are talking highest quality waffles vs. highest quality pancakes waffles take it
Greg,i mean I guess but theres something about waffles thats kinda off putting
Greg,me and ava both chose pancakes
Greg,like theres a flavor there thats just  ? ? ?
Greg,eh
Greg,oh whoops
Greg,how do i describe it
Greg,"the only thing offputting about waffles is how much better they are than pancakes, given that they're the exact same thing cooked in a slightly different manner"
Greg,DIE
Greg,FALSE
Greg,they're like weirdly more bitter
Greg,nah
Greg,dude
Greg,maybe because theyre cooked more harshly
Greg,then you're just screwing up your pancake making
Greg,like who even cares to debate something as meaningless as this
Greg,like everyone in this discord
Greg,wait how? I want my pancakes to be sweeter
Greg,waffles with strawberry compote is the best way to wake up on a saturday
Greg,also I take my food very seriously
Greg,this is serious business!!
Greg,I have trash taste in food so I just eat what I like and keep to myself
Greg,"waffles with strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream, and maple syrup (like actual maple syrup, not whatever weird shenanagins like corn syrup that you guys have in the states) is honestly unbelievably good"
Greg,all that with pancakes instead of waffles is better imo
Greg,I guess we'll have to agree to disagree
Greg,naw cause with pancakes all the syrup and stuff doesn't stay on
Greg,I am a fan of fruit syrups personally
Greg,I mean don't get me wrong maple syrup is still hella good
Greg,pancakes soak up syrup better
Greg,"fruit syrup's alright, but it's not as good as actual maple syrup"
Greg,you can mix 'em and get some good combinations tho
Greg,truth
Greg,waffles soaked in syrup are a weird combo of hard and squishy
Greg,pancakes are soft and nice
Greg,
Greg,why is that a video XD
Greg,why did you make me download that
Greg,eat my waffles filled bootyhole
Greg,@HalfCentaur
Greg,@Trapezoider plane tickets are 358 round trip to dc
Greg,kk
Greg,can u afford
Greg,that will go down after holidays?
Greg,I mean
Greg,probably not
Greg,plane ticket prices can vary greatly over time so be sure to keep checking
Greg,they might be jacking up all prices since its around holidays
Greg,also tristan
Greg,can prolly hook us up with good deals
Greg,I looked at dates in the summer tho
Greg,if you book farther in advance itll be cheaper I think
Greg,they can't do that right now though since we don't know when it'll be
Greg,"His mother is a flight attendant, and is allegedly able to secure cheap flights regularly"
Greg,yeah
Greg,that'd be dope

Greg,Oh good
Greg,game's like.... 50gb tho
Greg,Oh
Greg,Invest in me bro
Greg,gg
Greg,It all makes sense
Greg,never has a steam game taken so long to allocate disk space
Greg,Kameron can afford a bunch of couches because he sells drugs
Greg,"Oh no, I've been found out"
Greg,Gotta move to South America now
Greg,actually I think you've mixed up cause and effect - he has to afford all the couches to store his drugs
Greg,Check out your supply?
Greg,"Kameron, take me with you"
Greg,Going to Columbia?
Greg,yo why the fuck did it have to allocate 50 gigs if the game is actually only 26.6gb?
Greg,@Sak von Sak let me know if the game is good

Greg,@Trapezoider Are you going to want to melee soon?
Greg,@Max @Jed @The Rona csgo in 15?
Greg,I'll play
Greg,is fusion going to play to make it 5?
Greg,yeah
Greg,@Trapezoider csgo with us?
Greg,@The Rona where you at
Greg,welp
Greg,my thermostat is broken again
Greg,rip
Greg,sad
Greg,fucking thing lasted like two weeks
Greg,warranty?
Greg,"leading me to assume that it's either a) a faulty model in general, or b) something wacky's going on with the electricity through that particular bit that's causing the thermostat to keep fucking up"
Greg,it's all handled and paid for by my landlord
Greg,cause the lease more or less legally compels him to give us a functioning house
Greg,"on an unrelated note, I think I might have gotten weirdly good at sm4sh falcon"
Greg,that or the fact that me and the guy I was playing had a combined seven hours of sleep made everything dumb work
Greg,@max
Greg,@Max
Greg,yeah?
Greg,Smash?
Greg,@Sak von Sak you mean your sleep + his sleep was 7 hours?
Greg,yes
Greg,yup
Greg,I had three hours he had four
Greg,K finishing one more run through of moonlight sonata third movement then running upstairs
Greg,3.5 mins
Greg,when is your crew battle thing sylki?
Greg,over
Greg,we didn't get anything on stream
Greg,how did it go?
Greg,which I'm super grateful for because I played like a rusty trash can
Greg,we went 0-2
Greg,but we still go the next round cause top 4 teams make it out and there were only 4 teams
Greg,so I've got time to remember how to play the game
Greg,so hopefully next time I don't lose six stocks and only take three
Greg,double elimination crews are weird
Greg,especially cause there was a grand finals reset
Greg,so it was like an hour and a half long
Greg,"melee crews were hype tho, unfortunately we didn't have a crew cause we couldn't get enough interest "
Greg,but I got to watch one crew's anchor take 12 stocks (that I saw) and lose the battle by one stock
Greg,Good luck next round!
Greg,our second match was kinda funny cause we lost by one stock and every single member of our crew is blaming themselves for not getting one more stock
Greg,"""I had a good read on him but I let him get too much of a lead early on""
""I misinput a kill throw and dropped a stock cause of it and then my next game forgot how to fight ryu until I was already on last stock at death percent""
""I went too deep when I was making a comeback and could have taken that last stock""
""I SD'd at under 50% when the other guy was last stock at 130%""
""I choked under the last stock pressure, the full knees weak arms heavy mom's spaghetti experience"""
Greg,which one is you?
Greg,the second
Greg,"although in afterthough I actually messed up the order, second and third should be swapped"
Greg,my back throw that was supposed to be upthrow was on the last stock of the almost comeback

Greg,"When an Emishi village is attacked by a fierce demon boar, the young prince Ashitaka puts his life at stake to defend his tribe. With its dying breath, the beast curses the prince's arm, granting him demonic powers while gradually siphoning his life away. Instructed by the village elders to travel westward for a cure, Ashitaka arrives at Tatara, the Iron Town, where he finds himself embroiled in a fierce conflict: Lady Eboshi of Tatara, promoting constant deforestation, stands against Princess San and the sacred spirits of the forest, who are furious at the destruction brought by the humans. As the opposing forces of nature and mankind begin to clash in a desperate struggle for survival, Ashitaka attempts to seek harmony between the two, all the while battling the latent demon inside of him. Princess Mononoke is a tale depicting the connection of technology and nature, while showing the path to harmony that could be achieved by mutual acceptance. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Greg,oh my b @Mr. Airplane thought you were trap
Greg,Why does who it is matter?
Greg,cause trap told his mom
Greg,Did you get in trouble?
Greg,did I get in fucking trouble
Greg,lmao
Greg,is that a question
Greg,"Yo, that's actually dick"
Greg,I'm going to counselling now no phone no car
Greg,prolly transfering schools
Greg,rip dc?
Greg,and on top of that my parents told my little brothers that I was making bad choices and my brother asked if I was gonna kill him
Greg,idk
Greg,we'll see if I'm even around then
Greg,don't kill yourself
Greg,you should become a therapist max
Greg,"I'm to brutally honest for that, I would be a much better life coach."
Greg,WHOOSH
Greg,ya know what that is
Greg,@Trapezoider what the fuck man
Greg,thats the sound the joke makes as it goes right over your head
Greg,wait hold up @The Chief Apple what happened dude
Greg,parents found my shit
Greg,did trap intentionally get you in trouble?
Greg,idk all I know is he told his mom that he smoked with me
Greg,snap dude
Greg,and that I peer pressured him  into it
Greg,atleast thats what I heard
Greg,so whats happening with your parents then?
Greg,idk man
Greg,no car
Greg,phone is being watched
Greg,counseling
Greg,and they might try to make me quit my job
Greg,geez
Greg,yeet
Greg,love my family
Greg,that sucks dude
Greg,my brother asking if I was gonna kill him is the worst part
Greg,like fuck
Greg,I'ma take a long walk tonight and see where I'm at
Greg,hopefully everything works out ok my dude
Greg,we'll see
Greg,oh yeah
Greg,I am probably getting transferred back to my old school at some point too
Greg,they almost called the police instead of talking to me about it too
Greg,well at least they didn't do that
Greg,they threatened that if I don't do exactly what they say they still will get police involved
Greg,so I have that hanging over me
Greg,which is nice
Greg,That's honestly stupid
Greg,Not gonna lie
Greg,I dont understand how parents can say something like that
Greg,you right
Greg,I mean you're their kid
Greg,so hey anyone have an extra bed 
Greg,do they not realize how that makes somebody feel?
Greg,but like real shit even ignoring the fact that you're their son who the fuck calls the police on someone for smoking weed
Greg,true
Greg,ESPECIALLY if they're your kid tho
Greg,well obv
Greg,"just got caught up on this, seems pretty dumb"
Greg,I mean I knew the risk
Greg,but still
Greg,they're still overreacting
Greg,it seems like they're handling this poorly
Greg,^understatement of the day^
Greg,what is the right way to handle something like this then?
Greg,oh shit man you smoke weed
Greg,like dont
Greg,^
Greg,"some things they did wasn't unreasonable, but transferring schools is hella dumb"
Greg,give an ultimatum before going all in on the reform
Greg,"I mean, yeah octo's parents are going super far but I don't think just saying ""don't do that"" is going to change anything"
Greg,"you don't decide someone's making bad life decisions, don't force them into worse places"
Greg,help them get somewhere better
Greg,well i mean its not like hes making terrible life choices that will ruin his future forever
Greg,"like ""if you CONTINUE to do this then we'll make you move schools"""
Greg,smoking weed is pretty lax
Greg,was talking from his parents' perspective
Greg,yeah but it is illegal at his age so its not a great idea
Greg,I mean there is no ultimatum
Greg,its all of the above
Greg,"no car, quit your job, go to counseling, possibly switch schools"
Greg,the parts of that that are at least partially reasonable - counselling
Greg,not really anything else
Greg,that quit your job part like what is that supposed to accomplish
Greg,unless it's their car that they're letting you use
Greg,but not any counseling
Greg,Christian counseling
Greg,I think it's so he doesn't have money to buy weed -_-
Greg,oh lord jesus
Greg,save that for the christian counseling jed
Greg,but like... a major part of traditional rehabilitation for stuff like this is to get a job so you become a productive person
Greg,^^^^^^^^^
Greg,but thats the thing
Greg,I smoke
Greg,but I am also a very productive highschooler
Greg,I have good grades
Greg,and a job
Greg,"""hey you seem like a really good kid, lets change that so that you stop smoking"""
Greg,yup
Greg,like literally taking away everything I've worked to get my life in a decent place
Greg,gone
Greg,my advice would be to wait till they've cooled off a bit and then talk to them about it in this context
Greg,there is no talking to them
Greg,my parents are close minded retards
Greg,you'll probably have to take some other punishment but if you can keep the stuff that makes your life better it's worth it
Greg,my life was kinda already shitty before this
Greg,now there isn't gonna be really anything
Greg,fuck
Greg,I dunno what to say man
Greg,
Greg,how would switching your school even help the issue?
Greg,"if they do force you into counselling talk to your counsellor about this stuff, if you can convince them that moving schools and making you quit is bad, they might be able to get your parents to back off a little"
Greg,^ the counselling part might be a blessing not a curse
Greg,just try not to see them as the enemy even if they're trying to make you a perfect little christian
Greg,fuck counseling
Greg,they've tried to make me go before
Greg,try to get the counsellor on your side for this
Greg,if you treat him like trash he'll just tell your parents you're an incorrigible shit and they'll punish you more
Greg,there is literally nothing more they can do to punish me
Greg,they've listed literally everything I enjoy or do
Greg,well if it can't get worse why not try to make things slightly less bad
Greg,I guess except for my pc
Greg,idk
Greg,it literally cannot hurt you
Greg,I wholeheartedly agree with sylki
Greg,yeah you guys are prolly right I'm just still pissed
Greg,fuck I was gonna study for the SAT tonight
Greg,go for that walk
Greg,oh well
Greg,walks are nice
Greg,I can't
Greg,walk around the house if you have to
Greg,I have to wait for everyone to0 go to bed cause I'm on house arrest
Greg,pace the house if you must
Greg,moving helps calm down
Greg,and at worse it's a passive agressive way to keep your parents awake
Greg,although that might not be a good thing

Greg,derp
Greg,"another contender for best clip (can't find it tho) is that time ice waveshined armada all the way across battlefield and back, then armada hit him with one downsmash and it put them back at even percents"
Greg,my favorite falco clip https://youtu.be/Jl4KkCyVFNo?t=11m8s
Greg,"Top 10 ""Armada Getting Rekt"" Moments"
Greg,"Includes notable set losses or memorable ""bodied"" moments. The final clip was mislabeled. It is the #1 clip, not the #4 as it says. VOD Sources: 10. Armada v..."

Greg,If I'm still having problems come morning I might stop by the drop in clinic on campus
Greg,But for now I'm 95% sure it's just the caffeine messing stuff up a bit coupled with the hyperawareness
Greg,"Cause it feeds on itself - I notice my heart rate increasing, stresses me out, heart rate increases more"

Greg,Wait really? Is he better than you now?
Greg,There's not really a lot of graphics in minesweeper
Greg,everything can just be drawn with code
Greg,What language are you doing this in ?
Greg,processing
Greg,I'm retarded and have never heard of that
Greg,Smh
Greg,Don't worry
Greg,no one has
Greg,Is it new?
Greg,Or SUPER old
Greg,Probably new-ish
Greg,What advantages does it have over other languages?
Greg,I couldn't tell you
Greg,:/ I think yours and other people's ability to program is so cool
Greg,It's super simple to learn
Greg,You guys are going to be the ones with all the power in this brave New world of ours
Greg,I always am so sloppy when I code. I make so many redundancies and no one understands what in doing because I get so disorganized
Greg,What course is mine sweeper for ?
Greg,My intro to computer programming course
Greg,This is my final project
Greg,Are you majoring comp sci?

Greg,"@Trapezoider You are always interested in how people learn things so I thought I would share the order in which I learned things in melee (to the best of my memory).
1.    Pick a main (Marth)
2.    Learn basic tech and combos
3.    Switch mains (Sheik)
4.    Switch mains (Jigglypuff)
5.    Learn basic Fox tech
6.    Switch mains (Fox)
7.    Learn the Fox matchup
8.    Learn intermediate Fox tech
9.    Learn the Luigi matchup
(I believe I met you sometime around here)
10.    Acquire a secondary (Sheik)
11.    Learn the Marth matchup
12.    Learn the Sheik matchup
13.    Learn the Samus Matchup
14.    Learn Advanced Fox tech
15.    Acquire another secondary (Falco)
16.    Learn the Captain Falcon matchup
17.    Learn the Falco Matchup"

Greg,I don't have a sequential order of things learned

Even in sad songs it's hard to find songs where they're sung with as much emotion as this one (a lot of the time it's just a sad melody and instrumentals).

Greg,sick = ill
Greg,does counting crows have any popular songs? cause I feel like I've heard of them before
Greg,I've probably brought them up a few times (they're one of my favourite bands)
Greg,I think I've heard of them too.
Greg,but their best known songs are probably Mr. Jones and Accidentally In Love (which was in one of the shrek movies)
Greg,I know them from Mr. Jones. My mom has played that song in the car so many times.
Greg,"Mr. Jones has over 147,000,000 plays on spotify so i guess you could say its popular "
Greg,oh damn lol

Greg,
Greg,"Sad Songs: Sullivan Street, The Long December, I Wish I Was a Girl, Goodnight L.A., Holiday in Spain, Black and Blue, Possibility Days, Raining in Baltimore (if you're in the mood for a song that's just straight up depressed)
Not Sad Songs (at least musically): Mr. Jones, Rain King, Murder of One, Come Around, Miami, Insignificant, Cowboys, Shallow Days, American Girls, Daylight Fading, Recovering the Satellites

If you like listening to albums, I haven't listened through all their stuff (hence how I just found Possibility Days), but here's a rough breakdown of the ones I do know:
August and Everything After - mostly sad songs/ballads, overall their best album, only one song on it I don't actively like (ghost train)
Hard Candy - more energetic/rock-like, still has some sad songs, but more songs I don't really like (good time, new frontier, carriage) , and apparently there's a deluxe version that has a few songs I haven't heard yet and I should probably check that out at some point. Probably my 2nd favourite overall.
Recovering the Satellites - chill rock, a lot of good songs but not many phenomenal ones. Third best.
Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings - starts out very heavy on a sort of heavy alt-rock sound that I don't really like, then it hits some good sad songs and then mellows out for the end. Each song is kinda hit-or-miss but there are some really good ones. Would be higher if it didn't have as many songs I don't like."

Greg,@Eric Working From Home
Greg,i have a secret project im going to show you tomorrow
Greg,
Greg,its not your dick is it
Greg,no
Greg,Alright @Trapezoider  and @Jed story update
Greg,I consulted my roommate about his thoughts on the matter
Greg,"and he was like if that is a dodge, that is the stupidest excuse of all time"
Greg,"So then she might actually be concussed, so to not seem like an ass I say I hope you feel better"
Greg,and if you still wanna study just message me
Greg,"She responded with ""Aight"""
Greg,bruh
Greg,it was a dodge
Greg,It was totally a dodge
Greg,SMH
Greg,Yee but like
Greg,Aight is a weak ass response
Greg,That's like the last excuse I would use
Greg,"I dont know dude, this isnt look good. Dont reach out to her for awhile though. When will you see her in person next ?"
Greg,idk
Greg,There's a chance that I see her on one of the exam days
Greg,If we are in the same room
Greg,if not will you prolly not sere her again?
Greg,She might be in one of the same classes as me next semester
Greg,ooh thats guch. I would try to interact as much as possible in person to judge where shes at
Greg,"With my response though, the ball is in her park"
Greg,So if she is interested at all she would probably message me to study
Greg,"If not, she doesn't message me and it's whatever"
Greg,I hope she does or else shes a huge dork
Greg,I don't really care considering I know next to nothing about her
Greg,but is she attractive?
Greg,Yeah
Greg,
Greg,"But if she's someone who's gonna dodge with an excuse like ""I got a concussion"" I probably don't wanna be with them"
Greg,It's like  the boy who cried wolf
Greg,White lies in the short term solve nothing
Greg,and only cause more pain
Greg,Good idea to stay away= from FOLKS LIKE THAT
Greg,@everyone
Greg,Any math studying tips?
Greg,If I do good on this final I have three weeks of bliss
Greg,Do practice problems
Greg,^
Greg,lots and lots of practice problems
Greg,that's my basic plan for my stats exam
Greg,I get an 8.5/11 sheet for notes
Greg,Should I just wright example problems on there too?
Greg,Or concepts
Greg,"put the formulas on it, and if there are practice exams that seem to have common questions right those down too"
Greg,math is for nerds anyways
Greg,Thanks sylki
Greg,And doctor
Greg,no problem
Greg,anything to procrastinate even more on my own studying
Greg,(that's a bit of an exagerration I've already studied a solid amount today and I feel pretty justified in taking the evening off)
Greg,I was gonna study like all day
Greg,But then I spent the whole morning finishing my shity paper
Greg,Because I literally FORGOT
Greg,But doctor is a god and he helped 
Greg,@Sak von Sak Do your math teachers ever default to weird examples?
Greg,Because whenever he talks about any type of regression he always does so in terms of frog populations over time
Greg,occasionally
Greg,mostly my stats teacher goes off on weird tangents
Greg,like the time he somehow ended up discussing how he'd much rather have a goat than a ferrari
Greg,why?
Greg,Is a goat better than a ferrari?
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,@Master Memers im never playing skyblock with @The Rona ever again

Greg,"I am very confused. So someone left a comment on a youtube album saying that the album stopped kids from becoming liberals by warning them about the dangers of the world becoming like the one in the album. But the album is about a world where all freedom of expression is basically banned, which kinda happens on both extreme ends of the political spectrum (either agressive safe spaces and everything censored to avoid offending people or on the other end the shutting down of people being some way that they don't like (like gay), and in general on the extremes of both sides just the shutdown of opposing opinions). Funnier still is that the band is a Canadian one so they're probably fairly left by default -_-"
Greg,"on top of which, this album (and a lot of their other stuff) are basically just about how important music is to society, which isn't a political statement in any way"
Greg,and I genuinely can't decide if the comment was a bait or not
Greg,I AM UPSET

Greg,Wait what was the previous chess ai
Greg,Was it deep blue?
Greg,Or was that the one from 1993
Greg,That beat kasperov
Greg,"Deep Blue was the first AI to take a match from a world champion (it beat kasparov). It did this in 1997. The current best chess engine (at least it was) is Stockfish. Google's new AI is called AlphaZero and it beat Stockfish in a 100 game match with 28 wins, 72 draws and 0 losses. It even won 3 games with black (which is very rare at engine level). AlphaZero achieved this after only 4 hours of learning and is likely the strongest chess entity to ever play the game."
Greg,How much training data did it have?
Greg,I love how they name their ai alpha (blank)
Greg,Alpha go
Greg,The go ai
Greg,And now alpha zero
Greg,But seriously how much training data have
Greg,And what was the capactiy of the agents housing?
Greg,Processing power*
Greg,@Trapezoider The only knowlege it had was the rules of the game and 4 hours of playing against itself.

Greg,I'm good basically whenever
Greg,I'm through with studying for the day
Greg,I'm not sure I want to play a rivals tourney
Greg,I'm just watching capcom cup atm and I can stop whenever
Greg,@Max why not
Greg,If I play I'm not going to go tryhard with mains
Greg,ok thats fine
Greg,but like why tho
Greg,I'm probably gonna etalus and ori only
Greg,I just don't have the motivation
Greg,motivation to play a video game
Greg,for fun
Greg,with your buds
Greg,to play well with wrastor i need to grind for awhile
Greg,oh ok
Greg,then don't play wrastor
Greg,^
Greg,that is my main
Greg,when I say no main I mean no wrastor
Greg,in all fairness you said mains
Greg,which means I probably won't play ori
Greg,he is also a character that needs practice to play well
Greg,i feel like if we do a tourney ill prolly get last
Greg,jed might win
Greg,if max isnt playing wrastor
Greg,nah max still beats me anyways
Greg,"I prolly wont be on till kinda late, like 10EST or later, will you guys still be here?"
Greg,yee
Greg,I'll be here
Greg,@Sak von Sak ?
Greg,I don't have to go to school tomorrow
Greg,I'll be there
Greg,I don't have anything tomorrow till like 130
Greg,noice
Greg,my sleep cycle is totally screwey tho
Greg,"couldn't fall asleep till 4am last night, woke up at 730, couldn't fall back asleep till 9, slept till like 1230"
Greg,thats me over the summer
Greg,damn I barely know street fighter but this is a hype tournament
Greg,I'm just gonna cheer for this one japanese dude who plays the only character I vaguely know how to play
Greg,I prolly won't be here till 8ish pst
Greg,im nto sure yet tho
Greg,jk ima be here
Greg,ha even armada's watching capcom cup
Greg,and he's cheering for the same guy as me
Greg,ha

Greg,Sorry I was gone all day lol
Greg,Our man Devon can't watch tonight
Greg,
Greg,Tomorrow then?
Greg,I will be home at like 9 PST
Greg,Or we just watch anyways XDEEEEE
Greg,also @Homies I read something about a rivals tournament maybe?
Greg,"If there is a tourament, it will be late. Although late is relative and since you are PST it might not be that late for you."
Greg,kk
Greg,good god this tournament's hype
Greg,???
Greg,capcom cup
Greg,tis a street fighter tournament
Greg,like the biggest non-evo one of the year
Greg,LINK
Greg,https://www.twitch.tv/capcomfighters
Greg,CapcomFighters - Twitch
Greg,Capcom Cup Day 2 - Top 32 to Top 8
Greg,you just missed a nutty winner's finals
Greg,"@Rivals of Aether ill be there in 30, lets start the tourney then"
Greg,kk
Greg,kkk
Greg,kkkk
Greg,kkkkk
Greg,f
Greg,no
Greg,pay your respects man
Greg,street fighter looks so hard
Greg,apparently this is the easiest street fighter
Greg,they made a ton of stuff more lenient
Greg,ah
Greg,dude nemo tho
Greg,nemo's the guy I'm cheering for
Greg,due to having played like 15 minutes of urien once
Greg,I've only watched one but same
Greg,urien just seems cool
Greg,yee let's go nemo
Greg,This game looks so boring
Greg,huh
Greg,I think it looks pretty interesting
Greg,"but part of that is I probably have a bit of a better idea of what's going on (not by a ton, but somewhat)"
Greg,I've watched a lot of different traditional fighters and this one seems by far the least interesting.
Greg,it's not quite as crazy as a lot of them but it's way easier to tell what's going on
Greg,"imo my favourite one to watch is p4a, shame it's basically a dead game (they released a really good balance patch... only to the arcade version and so like half the community migrated and the other half couldn't and it killed the game for the most part)"
Greg,I'm so happy to have finally made some progress. I clapped so hard my hands now hurt.
Greg,(This is minesweeper for those who don't play)
Greg,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Greg,I'm gonna watch till the end of this set
Greg,which might be pretty fast
Greg,mmmk
Greg,@Trapezoider there is a losers bracket
Greg,why
Greg,smh
Greg,So you can have a second chance
Greg,@Homies R I V A L S O F A E T H E R I S A F U C K I N G G A Y A S S G A M E
Greg,no u
Greg,ur mum gay
Greg,no ur mum gay
Greg,@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Let me know who wins!
Greg,ur mum gay
Greg,@Max I won 3-2 3-1
Greg,Nice
Greg,I'm super happy cause it was a great set
Greg,but I'm still super salty
Greg,same
Greg,ugh one game I sd'd at like 5
Greg,fucking xxxswagdabkamxxx
Greg,and lost a really important game cause of it
Greg,@Max come play me
Greg,I don't want to
Greg,I only played the tourney as a favor I'm not really enjoying ROA right now
Greg,melee then?
Greg,in about 10 minutes
Greg,kk
Greg,you are boosted mans
Greg,I don't understand
Greg,I've lost 1 out of 10 ranked games
Greg,"@everyone finally finished putting together a rough outline of a tabletop rpg campaign (basically D&D, but not actually D&D), can I have a show of @me for a rough indication of numbers for who'd be interested? I'm either gonna start running it like, tomorrow evening or in the new year, haven't decided yet"
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,yes
Greg,@Sak von Sak I might be game
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,@Sak von Sak for kameron
Greg,hes down
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,can we start tomorrow? @Sak von Sak
Greg,probably yeah
Greg,sweet!
Greg,we got more people than I expected so I'm gonna have to tweak the fight I had planned
Greg,"but meh, it's fun to put characters together"
Greg,Now I've got to come up with a clever character that isn't just lawful good
Greg,tomorrow will probably be like two-ish hours of character creation
Greg,so you don't need a ton of premise
Greg,TWO HOURS???
Greg,yote
Greg,character creation takes ages
Greg,especially since you guys don't know the system or any of the charms (there are probably upwards of 100) which form the basis of your character
Greg,and from what I've found you'll probably get ideas for how you want your character to be as a person as you start putting them together as a bundle of stats and abilities
Greg,@Sak von Sak rivals?
Greg,naw
Greg,hands kinda hurt
Greg,com'on
Greg,nope
Greg,kk
Greg,thou shalt not tempt me
Greg,t h o u s h a l t n o t t e m p t
Greg,t h o u g h s h a l t u s e t h e s p a c e b a r
Greg,a l o t
Greg,How similar is the character creation to D&D?
Greg,ish
Greg,it's a bit more straightforward imo
Greg,there aren't clearly defined classes in the same way
Greg,"which is good and bad - good that I don't have to cover how to play different classes for each person who's playing, bad in that you have a ton of options no matter what"
Greg,"also there's fewer weird things with equipment and race, and there's no super complex classes where you're choosing religions and the associated weird benefits and stuff"
Greg,https://i.imgur.com/6LaF38R.png
Greg,silver snipers op
Greg,^
Greg,Where can I find a VOD of them?
Greg,They probably don't have one

Greg,yuri roughly average girl
Greg,@Feral Nebula Need backup
Greg,huh?
Greg,I'm in for sayori on monika
Greg,but honestly it's doki doki literature club the characters aren't that that deep
Greg,yuri is bAD
Greg,ffs someone play something where there is an actual valid best girl to be had
Greg,ddlc doesn't have the character depth to justify this much of a best girl fight
Greg,true
Greg,do I need the dlc?
Greg,
Greg,there's dlc?
Greg,I'm not arguing for the best. Just that Yuri was the worst by far.
Greg,Yeahi ts like 20
Greg,no you don't
Greg,let people have their opinions tho @ max
Greg,yeah you communist]
Greg,Yo im bout to get some cupcakes
Greg,from the literature club
Greg,why did you even decide to play it
Greg,because it looks cooL?
Greg,\
Greg,yeah but all of us played it a long time ago
Greg,cause he finished daddy dating simulator and needed a new on e:P
Greg,I didnt even know this game existed
Greg,That was probably during one of my long  frostbite hietus;s
Greg,oh right
Greg,Someone find an actualy dating sim so that we can actually have best girl arguments

Greg,if I can convince everyone to play katawa shoujo I will
Greg,Hell yea
Greg,no lets play roblox
Greg,No meme
Greg,join up
Greg,no
Greg,its premise is incredibly alienating but it's incredibly good
Greg,it might sound cheesy but it literally changed me as a person
Greg,the only way you're getting me to play roblox is as a meme
Greg,Sylki plays dating sims???
Greg,just the one
Greg,It's the only way he can get women
Greg,wait you don't
Greg,?
Greg,gotta fill the void some how
Greg,and I only started it out of spite so that I could critique people who kept telling me to from a more informed perspective
Greg,and then somehow I actually ended up really liking it
Greg,LOL
Greg,gg
Greg,yeah hes not gay
Greg,hes a cool mans
Greg,@Sak von Sak dating sims are cool
Greg,in general I will disagree
Greg,because of how REALISTIC THEY ARE
Greg,-_-
Greg,
Greg,realistc?
Greg,its a meme
Greg,They arent
Greg,oh
Greg,no girls talk like that
Greg,obviously its fake
Greg,dating whamen is so much fucking work smh
Greg,wait you don't have every girl you mett flirt with you?

Greg,nyoom
Greg,nyoom
Greg,same
Greg,lol
Greg,"so I've been putting together one last character for day one of the campaign, I might not end up using them cause I kinda made them op as fuck"
Greg,they kinda got away from my original idea of a graceful grappler kind of a fighter
Greg,"she can grab you, do a genuinely unreasonable amount of damage, possibly freeze you for as many turns as she does damage, and then while you're frozen trap you in a bubble that will probably take at least two turns to break through even after you defrost"
Greg,what the fuck dude
Greg,Thats op
Greg,This man is a monster
Greg,"oh and she also has a pretty unreasonable amount of health and defense, a few skills that increase her defense even further, and a skill that can force you to ignore a squishy person until you deal with her"
Greg,which you're not gonna be able to cause she's tanky as fuck and is just gonna freeze you and trap you in bubbles
Greg,yo balance these mans
Greg,dont delete her
Greg,this lady's getting balanced
Greg,just tone down?
Greg,"I'm removing the tankiness and the forcing you to deal with her first, reducing her damage"
Greg,so now maybe she won't look like this
Greg,OH MY GOD
Greg,WHO IS THESE MANS
Greg,What is the setting for this campaign?
Greg,modern fantasy
Greg,im hyped
Greg,So I can be a school girl?
Greg,im actually hyped as fuck
Greg,can I be a columbine shooter?
Greg,:-:
Greg,probably not
Greg,k
Greg,also yes you can 100% be a schoolgirl
Greg,Sweet
Greg,k if theres a sschool girl
Greg,I might be a schoolgirl
Greg,when I played this I played a schoolgirl
Greg,there needs to be a school shooter
Greg,smh
Greg,we also had a hairy motherfucker in his midthirties who was kind of a pedo
Greg,it was hilarious
Greg,can I be a generic terrorist?
Greg,not really
Greg,uGHHH
Greg,you're kinda prevented from being all that evil by the premise of the game
Greg,you can only be a little evil
Greg,Can I be a terrorist whos suicide vest didnt detonate so now he just screams allah ackbar at everyone he meets?
Greg,please no
Greg,"although you could, with a bit of work, plausibly be a reusable suicide bomber"
Greg,it just wouldn't be practical
Greg,y e s
Greg,p l e a s e
Greg,Actually ima be a kekistan memer who lives in his moms basement
Greg,it's far easier to throw explosives or set traps than attach them to yourself
Greg,I do not condone this
Greg,cause you'd need at least one or two charms to make sure you don't die every time you blow yourself up
Greg,also you need to get the explosives from somewhere
Greg,yo this sounds complicated as fuck
Greg,yeah no shit being a reusable suicide bomber is complicated
Greg,
Greg,please let me do it
Greg,Trap
Greg,please
Greg,Please fucking let me be  a reusable suicide bomber
Greg,no\
Greg,T H I S I S M Y C A L L I N G N I B B A
Greg,sigh
Greg,"basic plan at this point is character creation -> test fight with a team I've put together -> tweaking your characters, so you can give it a shot"
Greg,y e s
Greg,TTHANK YOU
Greg,Thank you dungeon master
Greg,
Greg,"basic rule #1 of DMing: if it sounds dumb, and your player wants to try it, let them try. If it crashes and burns, you warned them. If it works, then it's fun."
Greg,My friend tried for like 10 minutes to tame a wolf in some cave
Greg,My other friend ended up killing in on purpose
Greg,yo sylki
Greg,Gotta be honest
Greg,never played dnd
Greg,Parents thought it was satanic 
Greg,lololol
Greg,"What, how?"
Greg,so this is gonna be me being fucking autisic and doing dumb shit
Greg,while everyone wrecks
Greg,I mean you can basically worship satan in traditional d&d
Greg,yee
Greg,I mean
Greg,my parents are super religious
Greg,you can
Greg,I wasnt allowed to play pokemon
Greg,because they thought it was satanic
Greg,my childhood was fucked
Greg,
Greg,woah woah you're parents are those people??
Greg,That's a feelsbad
Greg,ye
Greg,thats why crazy shit happens sometimes round here
Greg,"on an unrelated note, holy shit I just realized it's technically possible to have a character who, out-of-the-box after character creation, can summon and control thunderstorms"
Greg,@mycomputerbeingthrowninagarbagecaninasnowstorm
Greg,Dibs
Greg,dibs
Greg,they can't do... anything else
Greg,I already called it
Greg,bids
Greg,I'm gonna be a little school girl who controls the weather
Greg,i call shotgun
Greg,btw you can just... get that a little later
Greg,
Greg,it's not even all that good early game because your activation stats will be meh
Greg,yo do we get mounts?
Greg,?
Greg,do we get M O U N T S to increase movement?
Greg,Like could I theoretically ride a goat into battle
Greg,yes
Greg,FUCK YES
Greg,there's even a fighting style for mounted combat
Greg,I AM THE REUSABLE GOAT RIDING TERRORIST
Greg,your goat would die every time you detonated tho
Greg,how expensive are goats?
Greg,fucked if I know
Greg,I haven't looked into it
Greg,canI just keep buying more goats?
Greg,theoretically
Greg,CaN i have a swarm of goats follow me into battle?
Greg,like the zerg
Greg,but goats
Greg,I don't think they'd attack for you
Greg,I'd have to skim the rules and charms
Greg,Damn
Greg,see if there is a possess charm
Greg,so I could possess all the goats
Greg,but I'm probably gonna say no just cause that'd make combat a bitch
Greg,and the goats would all have to have their own turns
Greg,holy shit yeah
Greg,and it'd take forever
Greg,wouldnt we have to roll for every goat
Greg,Yeah
Greg,LOL
Greg,yes
Greg,not fun for the everyone else tho
Greg,OH MY GOD
Greg,"Sylki, I didnt realize how hype this game could be"
Greg,holy shit bois
Greg,"ok so there is in fact a charm called ""Tame the Savage Beast"" which lets you give animals commands"
Greg,it has an upgrade
Greg,oh god
Greg,swarming: can give orders to a whole swarm of creatures
Greg,although they have to be small
Greg,FUCK YESS
Greg,ie not goats
Greg,GOATS ARE SMALL
Greg,GOATS ARE SO SMALL
Greg,"this is like, small birds/insects/mice small"
Greg,
Greg,look how small these mans are
Greg,@Max brb replacing one of my existing characters with a recreation of Skitter
Greg,
Greg,these mans are so small
Greg,no
Greg,you can command a single goat
Greg,okay mans
Greg,Wait sylki
Greg,...
Greg,Is there a charm to miniaturize things?
Greg,
Greg,oh dear
Greg,lemme look
Greg,technically yes
Greg,applying it to goats would be unreasonably expensive
Greg,Don't feed him Sylki
Greg,he couldn't get all the bits necessary till late game
Greg,so I don't mind this one
Greg,"Can I be a really old wise wizard who, instead of dying, opted to transfer his soul into robot/new body (a kid)."
Greg,Sylki
Greg,I will make this dream happen
Greg,My imagination has been empowered
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,nope
Greg,rip the dream
Greg,you could be a wise old wizard who did die and was reborn and remembers his past life
Greg,omg
Greg,although it's kinda hard to wizard in this game
Greg,the traditional wizard-style stuff isn't super practical
Greg,I might add the remembers past life to a different class
Greg,I USED TO BE A KING
Greg,and stuff like that could be fun
Greg,I can't wait to see how your king interacts with trap's lunatic miniature goat herder
Greg,yes this will be interesting
Greg,And my Schoolgirl
Greg,
Greg,Who may or may not be controlling the weather
Greg,The king demands it stops raining
Greg,rains more
Greg,struck by lighting
Greg,"just a recommendation, don't build for storms out of the gate, build for storms a few level-ups later"
Greg,cause if you build for immediate storms your character sucks at first
Greg,
Greg,aight buff grappler is no longer op (or buff)
Greg,"still has that hilarious grapple -> freeze combo, but I removed the additional bubble thing, reduced her damage, health, and defense"
Greg,"op buff grappler might come back at some point tho, it's too good an idea to pass up"
Greg,Suddenly a swarm of goats ascends into the air and generates a whirlwind which dispells the storm
Greg,ok you can't have flying goats
Greg,I'm pretty sure that one's impossible
Greg,C H E C K THE RULES
Greg,See if there is a levitation charm
Greg,yes but it only applies to you
Greg,you can't levitate other people
Greg,
Greg,wait shit you can
Greg,Thats actually a bummer
Greg,but you have to also be flying
Greg,OKAY
Greg,SO MY MAN
Greg,Dang
Greg,YOU ARE TELLING ME
Greg,I need this
Greg,I'll be like storm
Greg,I CAN LEVITATE WITH A SWARM OF MINITUARIZED GOATS
Greg,"technically, yes"
Greg,technically I am about to nutt
Greg,you will be basically useless in all other situations tho
Greg,oh shit im prolly gonna die
Greg,If I dont levelup my characters normal abilities
Greg,smh
Greg,"cause the charms you need for the levitating, the size changing, and the size changing applied to goats are all really expensive"
Greg,like lots of experience to get to them
Greg,and lots of mana-equivilant to use them
Greg,damn
Greg,how long will this run take?
Greg,for us to complete as a group
Greg,I have no idea
Greg,Whats the longest run you have done?
Greg,once a week for like 8 months
Greg,Are you willing to DM this all the way through if it takes a million years
Greg,but I've never DM'd
Greg,and I don't know how long my planned plot will last
Greg,Im so hyped bois
Greg,my advice is roll with a smaller goat-related goal
Greg,if he gets goats I want wolves
Greg,no fuck you
Greg,wOW
Greg,offended
Greg,goats > everything else
Greg,WOLVES
Greg,jokes
Greg,are cool
Greg,its a meme
Greg,ur a meme
Greg,same issue as with goats - you can only realistically run one wolf or goat at a time
Greg,Please tame your flying miniture goats
Greg,sad
Greg,then I will have one wolf friend
Greg,unless you want to spend a fuckton of exp on making them little
Greg,THEN MAKING THEM LEVITATE
Greg,christ
Greg,this is gonna be a good time
Greg,"on that note, it's 230am, I'm going to bed"
Greg,'night sylki
Greg,night sylki

Greg,That's a dumb way of looking at it
Greg,Why?
Greg,
Greg,Me irl
Greg,I literally screenshot that line when I was playing thinking it fit you perfectly @Trapezoider
Greg,I wish I could control my desires smh
Greg,If I could keep the same level of motivation I get for stuff in the beginning over a long period of time
Greg,I would be a god
Greg,The only thing I do that with is piano
Greg,How do I improve this low trait consciencousness part of myself?
Greg,I wish that I stopped getting kotaku articles suggested to me by google
Greg,I dislike kotaku

Greg,"""Ash from Pokémon Will Change Again Next Year"""
Greg,Kotaku I don't care
Greg,"""Breath of the Wild's Best Shrine is A Spike-Filled Death Maze"""
Greg,its moral to use adblock on kotaku
Greg,Kotaku I don't care
Greg,"""Super Mario Odyssey Player Beats Game Without Jumping"""
Greg,"Kotaku, I care a little bit about that, but I'm not reading your shit"
Greg,"""On The Origins of Sombra"""
Greg,"Kotaku, the character is over a year old. You're a little late to the party"

Greg,This is so easy
Greg,He appears to the north
Greg,I know
Greg,And flies south to the valley
Greg,Then descends
Greg,Then you just wait for his gust of wind
Greg,He never fucking comes to the trench
Greg,And paraglide around him till his horns turn blue
Greg,I know how his spawning works
Greg,Okay he only goes down way further in the canyon
Greg,You will end up close to the thundra plane

Greg,@Jed
Greg,Is that online or in person
Greg,Also @Sak von Sak
Greg,Online
Greg,Can you talk for a few minutes?
Greg,There aren't really any locals
Greg,I didn't think their would be
Greg,"Cool piece of data from an old stats exam I'm doing (this is an actual cited study, ie true data): Researchers tested a sample of women shortly after they had given birth in a large urban hospital. Each mother, blindfolded to prevent sight or smell, felt the hands of her own infant plus two others of the same sex. Of the 68 mothers with at least an hour exposure to their newborns, 47 correctly identified their own baby."
Greg,What the fu
Greg,That is incredible
Greg,"the actual question wanted us to figure out exactly how unlikely that is to occur by chance, and the result was the most extremely unlikely result I've seen in this entire course"
Greg,even taking into account the relatively small sample size
Greg,"the exact percentage value isn't even included in the chart we get for calculating exact percents cause it's so unlikely that every point is basically the same, but the actual value ends up being less than 0.000000001% that that result was a fluke"
Greg,"basically, if it is actually pure guesswork and only 1/3 of the time they should have guessed right, there's a less than 0.00000001% chance that the study would produce those results or results more extreme than that"
Greg,That's mental
Greg,Yo is it homosexual to be a mother?
Greg,"No, it is incest though"
Greg,Like
Greg,you had your kid inside of you
Greg,
Greg,@Melee If smash melee is so good then how comes theres no Smash Melee 2 #SuperSmashFlash2

Greg,nvm still stomped this fool
Greg,aggroforlife
Greg,"@Melee This combo video has a lot of sentimental value to me as it was one I really enjoyed during my early days of melee. It also shows a lot of the story lines of the time and, in a way, is even better now considering we know what will happen with Hungrybox. Just re-discovered this and thought I would share it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKpp7NOwH5w"

Greg,I made 4 dollars on bitcoin today
Greg,cool
Greg,don't spend it all in one place
Greg,ye
Greg,im leaving my rig mining every day
Greg,and its free because I dont pay electricity
Greg,so $4 a day
Greg,not bad over a year
Greg,spread your marvelous bounty across multiple vending machines
Greg,Yo just gonna save the btc I get
Greg,so youre basically stealing from your parents
Greg,lololol
Greg,are you fucking retarded
Greg,You steal by existing
Greg,I wonder what the actual electricity breakdown is tho
Greg,All of us did
Greg,no its charity
Greg,but there's no way he's drawing enough that it's noticeable
Greg,then they are being gracious enough
Greg,to pay my electricity bill
Greg,well If I was paying it
Greg,It would be enough to make my profits negligible
Greg,also the current btc directory is 150 gb
Greg,smh
Greg,the blockchain is so huge
Greg,does it really take that much energy to make bitcoins?
Greg,yeah you are basically running your gpu on max all day
Greg,huh
Greg,do you know what a gpu is?
Greg,it's the graphics card
Greg,its a graphics processing unit
Greg,yeah
Greg,essentially
Greg,the calculations needed to generate bits on the blockchain
Greg,are very similar to graphics processing
Greg,so gpu's work best for btc mining
Greg,and running a modern gpu on full power
Greg,all day
Greg,"still, heating my room from like -10 outside to a comfortable 20 inside only costs me like $50-$60 a month"

Greg,small city power is dirt cheap
Greg,as is small city rent
Greg,I'm cracking up that my brother's paying more for a tiny ass apartment in a semi-sketchy neighbourhood in san fransisco than the monthly rent for my entire four-person house right outside downtown kingston

Greg,"one of my non-exam courses finally got all the marks in, due to the wonder of bonus marks I managed to squeak my 89 up to a 90"
Greg,which is a huuuuuge deal
Greg,cause 89 is treated the same as 80
Greg,and 90 is treated the same as 100
Greg,"one thing about math stuff is that a lot of the time things that sound super complicated are actually pretty straightforward, but I think I've finally found something that sounds pretty much just as complicated as it is"
Greg,"""One-way completely randomized analysis of variance"""

Greg,@The Rona
Greg,?>
Greg,how was ur exam
Greg,my dude
Greg,good
Greg,One question that I didn't know how to do though
Greg,there was a question that i had no fucking clue what the answer was on my programming midterm so i just guessed and got full marks
Greg,like is was the second most heavily weighted question
Greg,"""what are the 5 steps of pre planning"""
Greg,"and i was like i think nityan has said something about DDIT (Design, Develop, Implement, Trace)"
Greg,but thats only 4
Greg,fuck just add F to the end and say final test
Greg,and apparently that was right
Greg,so I guess an earthquake just happened where I'm at?
Greg,Are you dead?
Greg,I wish
Greg,I didn't even feel it tbh
Greg,oh prolly cause it wasn't in my city
Greg,are you suicidal
Greg,Why would you WANT an earthquake????
Greg,cause that'd be awesome
Greg,Dude death by earthquake would be epic
Greg,I didnt feel it either
Greg,I think these fags are lying
Greg,also @Feral Nebula
Greg,its almost T I M E
Greg,i s  i t
Greg,ye
Greg,It was centralized in mollala so that's why it was weak if that here
Greg,well we better get used to it
Greg,were going to be south of the bay area in two years
Greg,Lots of earthquaks my dude
Greg,also my phone is almost as big as my switch
Greg,smh
Greg,Oi lmoi
Greg,boi
Greg,I was playing this cocky ass clairen who taunted after every kill
Greg,and he taunted before I died last stock game 2 and I killed him for it
Greg,and then took game 3 as well
Greg,so satisfying
Greg,@Jed Which character were you playing?
Greg,ranno
Greg,GG
Greg,destroy all Clairen players
Greg,but you played Clairen in tourney...
Greg,that was because sylki revealed what I was actually playing
Greg,but still
Greg,you used what you despise
Greg,ye
Greg,hes right
Greg,you refuse to teach me clairen
Greg,because you dont want anyone playing clairen
Greg,then you play him in tourney
Greg,Why do you think I took the character choice path I did in melee
Greg,the logic here actually makes sense
Greg,I picked the character that beat my previous character the hardest until I got to fox
Greg,Marth to Shiek to Puff to Fox
Greg,if you hate op characters
Greg,why the fuck do you play fox lmao
Greg,Fox is not OP
Greg,he has weaknesses
Greg,so does clairen
Greg,He wouldnt be beatable if he didnt
Greg,not in the same sense
Greg,I DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING
Greg,AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED ANYTHING
Greg,DON'T PIN THIS ON ME
Greg,to beat clairen you just have to play better
Greg,also kameron wrecked your Clairen thus not OP
Greg,To beat fox you have to play better
Greg,Clairen has not real exploitable weakness
Greg,thats literally how rivals goes
Greg,lmao
Greg,you must play better
Greg,Clearly false if kam can beat you?
Greg,"poor you, you have to play better to beat someone"
Greg,my Clairen has under 2 hours total play time
Greg,boo hoo
Greg,By play better I mean play better + extra
Greg,so you can play better than them and still lose if it isn't by enough
Greg,Also the fox matchup...
Greg,lmao
Greg,Falco Marth and Samus all go even with fox
Greg,no one goes even with clairen
Greg,How can that be true lmao
Greg,which part?
Greg,No one goes even with clairen
Greg,From my experience either her range or her down b make her beat every character
Greg,Then get gud
Greg,^
Greg,or play a better game
Greg,@Jed
Greg,you gonna take that shit?
Greg,I think max complains too much about a character that I've heard commentary from good players
Greg,Real talk I still almost always beat Clairen on ladder and against Jed. I just think the character is stupid.
Greg,so get gud does not really apply
Greg,I'm already good I just don't have fun when playing against her
Greg,games are meant to be fun
Greg,"I dont have fun playing against fox. Does that mean fox is bad, and we should all complain against fox?"
Greg,so it isn't a matter of OP just a matter of not liking the matchup
Greg,Are you gonna quit melee because you hate the falco matchup?
Greg,No
Greg,cause I don't like playing against Zetters
Greg,You grind the matchup
Greg,DO YOU THINK I ENJOY SAMUS PUFF
Greg,and get good
Greg,it does apply
Greg,DO YOU
Greg,Why would you play melee if you you hate the matchup that you will be playing more than any other @Trapezoider ?
Greg,Because I like conquering the thing I despise with all my heart
Greg,that was really only right after the dlc dropped
Greg,Its why I play the game
Greg,Its also why I go through cycles of not
Greg,playing
Greg,Because I get frustrated and do rage quit the game because of dumb matchups I suck at
Greg,But
Greg,I kEEP  COMING BACK
Greg,but you still enjoy conquering the hard matchup
Greg,I don't
Greg,Because the eternal alure of the mountains I have to climb is more addicting than most thrills in life
Greg,hence why I never play bad characters in anything
Greg,The only thing Im pointing out why its dumb for you to complain about a strong character
Greg,Because you are the guy who defaults to strong OP characters
Greg,
Greg,strong does not equal over powered
Greg,Semantics
Greg,naw actually that's valid
Greg,but still
Greg,I think you're overreacting to clairen
Greg,^
Greg,If I liked her I would play her
Greg,I've been annoyed about it for a while just never said anything
Greg,you did play her...
Greg,for a day
Greg,In tournament
Greg,ONE MATCH FOR THE MEME
Greg,that is not evidence
Greg,that was not for the meme
Greg,"Why am I getting attacked over hating a character??? If Sylki randomly decided to post ""I hate falco"" I garuntee this wouldn't happen. Let me have an opinion."
Greg,you were mad that I said you weren't playing clairen
Greg,which you thought told kameron who you were playing
Greg,so you played clairen
Greg,I do hate falco
Greg,but I sucked it up
Greg,and I'm now pretty good against falco
Greg,honestly I think that Rivals is a fairly balanced game and its moreso playing the opponent than whatever character they choose
Greg,same with sheik
Greg,I sucked it up and I'm alright at the matchup now
Greg,now you are a G 0 D
Greg,its all about the grind matchup isn't important
Greg,so my brother works at uber
Greg,and apparently he takes an uber to work every day
Greg,"and frequently has a conversation that basically goes:
uber driver: so, where do you work?
my brother: oh, I work at uber.
uber driver: neat, how long have you been driving for them?
my brother (presumably insufferably smug): hahahaha no I'm an engineer at uber."
Greg,Does he get free Uber credits tho
Greg,yeah he gets like $200 free uber a month
Greg,
Greg,yo that man is straight up about to revolutionize the way we transport
Greg,Uber published a 95 white paper on electric VTOLS
Greg,I read the whole thing
Greg,Im hooked
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,is he working on that?
Greg,nope
Greg,he's doing some thing for people to sign up

Greg,Jed Canada is an option right?
Greg,yeah I think we still get net neutrality lol
Greg,finally a widely acceptable way that canada > us
Greg,The vote went 3-2
Greg,It passed
Greg,Canada here I come 
Greg,"Better health care, net neutrality"
Greg,"there's a lot of things I like about canada over the us, they're just not things that are universally appreciated (like free health care, gun control, adding 'u' to the spelling of words that don't strictly need it but imo it looks better, a more logical election system, better skiing, not being a terrorist target, etc.)"
Greg,Better skiing 
Greg,it's true
Greg,mostly just cause we've got more area that has good skiing weather so statistically we get more good mountains for skiing
Greg,you guys get a bit of the rockies and that's about it
Greg,"okay Google, how do I get Canadian citizenship"
Greg,honestly you can kinda just show up and ask nicely
Greg,if you live here and have a job at least
Greg,So not an extremely long difficult process like the us?
Greg,"we have a system that basically ranks you based on how much we think you'll benefit our society which takes a bit to get through (especially if you get ranked low), but honestly upper middle class white people showing up and getting a job on visa is pretty much a guaruntee that you'll get citezenship"
Greg,it's not instant but it's faster than the states
Greg,
Greg,"one thing that was kinda funny is that the states introduced a plan kinda like that, where people get ranked based on desireability and some canadians were acting all offended and like 'wow that's not a nice way to decide citezenship, canada's above shit like that'"
Greg,@The Rona Going to see Star Wars tonight 
Greg,noice
Greg,it's supposed to be reaaaally good
Greg,wait who has seen it?
Greg,my showing is the first
Greg,prescreenings exist
Greg,especially for reviewers so that they can have people say it's good to get more people to come watch on opening night
Greg,I normally don't trust mass opinion of whats good. I'm just hoping it isn't a copy paste of Empire Strikes Back like the last one was a copy of A New Hope.
Greg,It probably will be

Greg,Ai developments are so non linear
Greg,It's incredible

Greg,@The Rona good luck on exams mate
Greg,Also canada is weird as heck yo
Greg,"it's honestly a fairly good system, we let you in based on how much you're likely to contribute to our country"

Greg,he used to smoke when he was younger
Greg,so I guess he knows
Greg,So he's okay with you vaping?
Greg,I don't think so
Greg,I was giving it to them because my mom was concerned that I would be tempted by it while they were gone
Greg,cause I'm tryna sell it
Greg,Would you have used it if they didn't take it?
Greg,nah
Greg,I don't have anymore juice
Greg,I'm just tryna sell it rn it is kinda pointless

Greg,ay wrenchd is playing in the rcs tourney today
Greg,I agree
Greg,bruh what if you looked through a 1 way mirror and on the otherside was a mirror
Greg,cause wouldn't it just reflect nothing?
Greg,or reflect a reflection of a reflection
Greg,it'd be just like two mirrors reflecting each other
Greg,just without you being in it
Greg,but like
Greg,what does a mirror look like
Greg,it reflects light
Greg,whatever light is present will be reflected back and forth between the mirrors
Greg,literally all mirrors are one-way mirrors with a solid thing stuck to the back
Greg,"the reason one-way mirrors work is cause one side is way darker than the other, and on the light side enough light is being reflected that you can't see the stuff on the other side"
Greg,I highkey wanna buy a one way mirror now
Greg,yeah
Greg,Ok
Greg,The Last Jedi was really fucking good
Greg,like a room like this
Greg,
Greg,but with an external light source
Greg,so you don't see all the lights reflecting
Greg,problem with external light is that then you'll just see the outside
Greg,that only works because the light is on the inside
Greg,ah
Greg,I see the error now
Greg,Who the heck is using the Frostbite gamers Twitter account?

Greg,?
Greg,Doki doki is spooky as heck
Greg,doki doki is okey dokey
Greg,welp the application for this internship requires that I state my ethnicity
Greg,"in other words, they have a quota of ethnic diversity to meet"
Greg,"in other other words, time to get screwed for being white"
Greg,yo non-whites check your privilege
Greg,So what was that about white privilege again?
Greg,lol

Greg,THEN WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME IF IT WON'T AFFECT MY LIKELIHOOD BEING HIRED
Greg,"Because equality only applies to those who are not white straight males obviously, because we already have the whole of the white supremacist patriarchy on our side."
Greg,Things like this might be why the number of liberals decreases as age increases.
Greg,maybe
Greg,I think it's mostly just society moving left over time so the younger generations will be more left just by virtue of being born in a lefter time

Greg,Vote Now! [Hunter] [Priest] [Mage] [Shaman] [Warrior] [Paladin] [Warlock] [Rogue] [Druid] [Monk]
Greg,@Homies Looks like Nier Automata isn't part of the holiday sale.
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,should I buy skullgirls?
Greg,its 2 dollars
Greg,Its worth $2
Greg,Just know its very different from smash games
Greg,kk'
Greg,it's pretty good
Greg,but on the flip side neither me nor max is really playing it anymore
Greg,max just kinda isn't and I'm mostly playing blazblue and guilty gear
Greg,more things go on sale as the time passes
Greg,but it's good for if you're not sure if you'd like traditional 2D fighters and want to give it a shot
Greg,If you buy the game I'll pick it back up and learn a new character
Greg,My old main was garbage as a solo
Greg,eh yeah if you buy it and max picks it up again I will too
Greg,but if you main peacock I'm disowning you
Greg,any character where explaining how to get around their basic zoning takes more than six minutes is a character whose shit I refuse to put up with
Greg,"oh also you might be amused by this game just cause, at least until he picks a new main, my best character is more or less the best in the game and max chose one of the worst -_-"
Greg,*unknowingly
Greg,same on my end
Greg,"I just saw the guy who taught me playing them and went ""hot damn that looks sick"""
Greg,and my other character I mostly started playing cause they have a skin that makes them look just like my favourite character from persona 3
Greg,I picked my character because she has the least suggestive outfit
Greg,lol
Greg,"I still think it's pretty funny that of the two clone characters, one of whom is meh and the other is top tier you chose the lower tier one"
Greg,is skull girls sketch bois
Greg,define sketch?
Greg,FAN SERVICE
Greg,I mean yes
Greg,but they mix things up with it so that it's not pure fanservice
Greg,"like the character who's basically a bunch of limbs stitched together and can stretch those limbs out on individual tendons, throw her head at you, and wrap you in a ball of intenstines"
Greg,or the character who is literally just made out of blood
Greg,what the FUCK
Greg,or the unholy monstrosity that is my best character
Greg,thats fucking nasty
Greg,who is a shapeshifting undulating flesh blob
Greg,but there's plenty of characters with basically no fanservice
Greg,like big band
Greg,who is basically a ton of brass instruments in a trench coat
Greg,and with two on screen this is a thing that can happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qcjCnkbROY
Greg,skullgirls BigbandのTrumpetで東方U.N.オーエンは彼女なのか？を演奏

Greg,Is this a TAS?
Greg,yeah I think so
Greg,still great tho
Greg,and his lv5 super you have a little space to just jam out on the trumpet while time is stopped and if you end on the right four notes it activates
Greg,"brief history of why this is hilarious before I post the clip, in team fighting games, if you catch an assist and point character at the same time, it's known as a Happy Birthday"
Greg,"taken to its logical conclusion, https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyDepressedSpiderPeteZaroll"
Greg,KPBLive Playing Skullgirls - Twitch Clips
Greg,Happy Birthday - Clipped by MegaMissingn0
Greg,That is amazing
Greg,but in general it's not too hard to make teams where none of your characters are particularly fanservice-y
Greg,my current team is these two:
Greg,
Greg,and I'm probably gonna add either you
Greg,or you
Greg,"on the flip side you could always run eliza, valentine, and cerebella:"
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,but if you do that max's head might explode
Greg,I would also refuse to play against you except late at night
Greg,just you wait till I get you to play street fighter 5 and then pick up r mika
Greg,like seriously who thought this was reasonable
Greg,I've played street fighter and I thought it was super boring
Greg,it's mostly neutral
Greg,whereas sg is mostly punish
Greg,and I mostly just wanted to show that skullgirls isn't actually all that bad in terms of fanservice in fighting games
Greg,but I don't think I could bring myself to play someone whose design is that much shameless fanservice
Greg,I think the upshot of this whole discussion is you should all drop like $30 on guilty gear so we can learn together and I can fight you with a reasonably dressed girl who can summon motherfucking dolphins
Greg,I've seen that character
Greg,She looks pretty fun
Greg,"on top of which, playstyle-wise she's pretty much what I look for in a character - good zoning, but when you get in you can go ham"
Greg,"There is a chance I do buy it, but before I do, I want to have a conversation about the game."
Greg,I've only played like an hour
Greg,and only in tutorial and training mode
Greg,so I dunno if I can give a serious recommendation yet
Greg,i played the game for a bit i wasnt a fan adn refunded it
Greg,combos felt clunky
Greg,and hte punish game seems weak
Greg,every move is safe on block from what i could tell
Greg,from what I've heard the execution is reallllly tight
Greg,no idea about the safe on block bit
Greg,from watching it seems like there are definately safe block strings but they're not infinite
Greg,and this is a personal thing thid doesnt make the game bad but i prefer button block to directional block
Greg,i think i recall skullgirls had directional
Greg,but dont quote me
Greg,yeah it does
Greg,don't like... all fighting games?
Greg,at least all the ones I've played do
Greg,blazblue's got a weird mix
Greg,well i mostly play mortal kombat
Greg,i mean i still like fighting games that also have directional block like MvC
Greg,MvC is a crazy looking game
Greg,its a fucking nutty game
Greg,"never played it, but it feels a bit too much like two-touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, you win"
Greg,its more like
Greg,low sweep to uppercut knockup to 100-0 air juggle
Greg,i mostly just like the characters
Greg,love capcom and marvel so
Greg,combo of hte two always nice
Greg,my friend  plays the shit outta street fighter and i cant do shit agianst him
Greg,he mains ryu and im like hey man could you just play someone different so i dont get 100-0'd and he says yeah then swaps to ken
Greg,like thanks man he has the exact same moveset
Greg,lololol
Greg,apparently they're pretty different in sfv at least
Greg,but not... any other game really
Greg,ay apparently pubg is officially out of early access and they optimized a ton of stuff
Greg,yeah it is
Greg,it looks super good
Greg,its fun
Greg,I played so much last night
Greg,might take a stab at it again and see if my computer can handle it
Greg,@Trapezoider @Jed you man's are living together?
Greg,nah
Greg,I'm just at his house for 2 days

Greg,if you can get anything probably evo
Greg,or big house
Greg,I would do big house over evo honestly.
Greg,but evo is closer to you
Greg,but its also vegas
Greg,which is probably more expensive
Greg,and my parents probably wont let me go to vegas alone
Greg,but big house is in maine right?
Greg,it's in michigan
Greg,or you could come to goml 
Greg,where is that?
Greg,canada?
Greg,
Greg,Totally will if we do doubles together fam
Greg,I just wanna go to one major before this game dies

But, if you ask to use the machine, specifically to do some photocopying (ie, something that sounds like a reason but is actually just a redundant statement of what you do with a photocopier) the percentage of people who'll let you cut ahead jumps back up to 93%, only 1% less than if you give a valid reason"
Greg,if someone told me they were gonna use the photo copier to make spaghetti hell yeah im gonna let them go ahead of me i wanna see where hes going with this
Greg,"naw it's more like they go ""Can I use the photocopier? I need to make some copies."" and you're 33% more likely to let them use it than if they just ask ""Can I use the photocopier?"""
Greg,i like my version better
Greg,@The Rona due to the strike instead of my final math exam being cumulative of everything we've learned its only about logarithms and straight lines
Greg,ez marks
Greg,we couldn't even finish the logarithms unit so its only the easy logarithm stuff
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,In addition if you add the word because it increases your likelyhood i.e
Greg,"""I need to use the photocopier because I am in a rush and need to make copies"""
Greg,Are you in a psych class?
Greg,based on what the study was comparing (actually having a reason vs. having a sentence structure that sounds like a reason but isn't) that would be around the same as just saying that you're in a rush
Greg,naw I just stumbled across it
Greg,my fuckin family got one of those smart thermostats and so during the day when nobodys home the house is freezing to conserve energy but im fucking home during hte day they dont change it for the days i dont have college
Greg,why arent you back in school yet?
Greg,School isn't all day at university/ college
Greg,Dont you guys live on campus?
Greg,I thought you were dorm boys
Greg,dorm is really only a first-year thing in canada
Greg,Devon lives at home because the school is close
Greg,Dank
Greg,I go to a different school than him though
Greg,You go to waterloo right?
Greg,Yup
Greg,daNK
Greg,art thou in their coop stuff?
Greg,"Im in a ""Digital literacy class that is an absolute meme"
Greg,"cause they have like, the best co op in the country"
Greg,This is for people whomstve havent even used computers basically
Greg,plus you dont go to school everyday in college usually @Trapezoider
Greg,like i only have school 3 days a week
Greg,what
Greg,lucky bastard
Greg,There is a super attractive female next to me. Im gonna get her name tomorrow
Greg,Then number
Greg,I've always had five days a week
Greg,Welcome to college Sylki
Greg,Five days a week for me
Greg,but Im out by 1:30 everyday
Greg,I almost didn't this term but I had to move a course from first to second term so I'm right back on five days a week
Greg,welcome to mixing and matching your courses so you get a good schedule
Greg,and my stuff's mad spread out some days
Greg,although one of my days is 8-6
Greg,I'm not in a co-op program
Greg,I hate that shit
Greg,"today, I have 5 hours of class spread from 830am to 930pm"
Greg,I want all my classes to be back to back
Greg,I can still do it though if I want to
Greg,back to back classes is great
Greg,Wait doc you dont have females in your classes?
Greg,TF
Greg,"however, cause it's the first day of classes, I skipped my 830 cause they're just gonna go over the syllabus and I would only have had like 4 hours of sleep, and my 630-930 class got cancelled cause the prof has flu"
Greg,i have a 3 hour break on thursdays but me and my boys jsut go into town and get food during it
Greg,That's not what co-op means
Greg,lol
Greg,Thats what is means here
Greg,co op is mixed school and work terms
Greg,so you get a fuckton of experience by the time you graduate
Greg,im aware of what co-op menas
Greg,"It's basicly like an internship where you go an work for a company, but you get paid"
Greg,andrew isn't tho
Greg,Ive always heard it in referring to genders
Greg,Thats dank as fuck
Greg,im in the college with the #1 rated co-op program in ontario
Greg,oh
Greg,internships are actually paid pretty often
Greg,the terms are almost interchangeable at this point
Greg,just that internship can mean you don't get paid
Greg,true
Greg,you get paid in experience
Greg,yay
Greg,yeah but that blows
Greg,im gonna buy all the stuff with this experience ive earned
Greg,I ain't applying to no unpaid internships
Greg,what is the ratio of experience to bitcoins?
Greg,the same as the ratio of leprecauns to unicorns
Greg,http://puu.sh/yX1Jg/2cc62ab9e5.jpg
Greg,Anyone wanna buy .05 of a bitcoin
Greg,"thats like $10,000"
Greg,no
Greg,its $700 usd
Greg,no it really isnt
Greg,devon
Greg,"still, one thing I prefer from my school's internship stuff vs waterloo's coop is that waterloo does 4-month so you're basically in, trained, given some menial tasks for three months then booted out, whereas we do full-year stuff so you actually get better experience"
Greg,http://puu.sh/yX1L4/3087ec02dd.png
Greg,you are fucking wrong
Greg,"bitcoin are $15,000 usd"
Greg,"15,000 * .05 =$750"
Greg,What are you smoking?
Greg,he said .05 not .5
Greg,oh you said .05
Greg,DORK
Greg,not used to people not putting a 0 before hte decimal place
Greg,fucking americans
Greg,Those god damned yankees
Greg,that's not uncommon here
Greg,just not super common either
Greg,bruh i aint never seen it
Greg,wut
Greg,is the GTA just like a mini america inside ontario
Greg,Devon I can assure you that we have seen it
Greg,ye
Greg,cause dont you people call like chapstick blisterrods or something
Greg,basically
Greg,we also have aids here
Greg,lol not really
Greg,@The Rona well im sure if i actually looked at the board during math call i'd have seen it
Greg,also I've literally never heard the word 'blisterrod' in my life but it sounds horrible
Greg,what do you call chapsticks
Greg,isnt there like a wierd nickname
Greg,i could've sworn
Greg,"sometimes it goes by one of the brand names (blistex), like kleenex instead of tissues"
Greg,blistex
Greg,thats what it was
Greg,but that might be a french canadian thing honestly I have no idea in my house
Greg,fair
Greg,FAIR
Greg,FAIR

Greg,4
Greg,"one
two
three
four

Greg,You can add up to 4
Greg,why did my four not work
Greg,Gya
Greg,no
Greg,fuck

Greg,bvreaks

Greg,Gyazo
Greg,
Greg,max it means I left 3 hours after
Greg,and just got home because I got asked to go buy groceries
Greg,Still down?
Greg,I'm eating but I'll play after
Greg,GUYS! I NEED HELP! I feel like characters on the left are a stolen design of characters from the Fate Series. If you've seen the Fate series please help me out here!
Greg,"I mean, same hair eye color"
Greg,there are a few Fate parody type things
Greg,they might be from one of those
Greg,where did you find this?
Greg,"I made it myself, I took the left screenshots from an anime, I don't know the name of it, but the opening is called Apron Boy"
Greg,"When I first saw these characters, I initially thought it was an ending to a Fate anime, but then I saw that it was an opening and not even the same series"
Greg,is it from this? https://myanimelist.net/anime/37033/Emiya-san_Chi_no_Kyou_no_Gohan
Greg,Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan
Greg,A Fate/stay Night spin-off focused on cooking.
Greg,I think it is.
Greg,"well yeah, it's not stolen then it's just a spin-off"
Greg,besides I don't think character theft is a thing that happens in the anime industry
Greg,but what do I know
Greg,"Thanks for clearifying that, and I didn't think they were stealing the characters, I thought they were stealing the designs and naming them different characters"
Greg,"But one last thing I do find strange is that, Spin-Offs (or at least the ones I've seen) usually have a different cast of characters with members of the previous cast making side appearances. But I could be wrong"
Greg,I haven't seen many spin-offs so I don't really know. I guess there's just different ways to do it
Greg,maybe
Greg,@Trapezoider I'm ready
Greg,@Trapezoider We playing PUBG or not?
Greg,I'm cracking up
Greg,this kid I know from kingston used to play tf2
Greg,apparently
Greg,one of his teammates thought he was a girl
Greg,and was kinda sorta hitting on him constantly
Greg,which the kid didn't discourage
Greg,it eventually culminated in the guy buying the kid a csgo knife
Greg,he is living the trap dream
Greg,Did the guy ever find out?
Greg,yeah after awhile the kid felt kinda bad and told him and asked if he wanted the knife back
Greg,"to which the reply was basically 'naw you're a chill dude, keep it'"
Greg,wow what a guy
Greg,why give hte knife back
Greg,he scammed it fair and square
Greg,How expensive was the knife?
Greg,um
Greg,lemme check
Greg,"according to the steam market, $81.45"
Greg,Not bad
Greg,so like $65 usd
Greg,respectable scam
Greg,i used to scam people in warframe out of platinum
Greg,made like ~$200 worth of plat off it
Greg,I'm fufilling my namesake
Greg,Time to start scamming bibbas by fufilling mh destiny
Greg,Someone give me the trap tah
Greg,Tag

Greg,been reading for the last little while
Greg,and hoooly shit the plot twist
Greg,never have I ever seen such a comprehensive plot twist
Greg,something that somehow seeped into like... everything
Greg,What are you reading?
Greg,it's part of an unfinished series (book 3 of an eventual 10)
Greg,"The Stormlight Archives, by Brandon Sanderson (my favourite author, and probably his best series thus far)"
Greg,fucking impressive plot twist
Greg,it was even the kind of thing where it's like 'there is going to be a plot twist about this'
Greg,but I was not expecting anything like this
Greg,@deleted-role
Greg,maybe?
Greg,sure
Greg,"there's a kazahkstanian csgo player whos name is Jame ""Jame"" Jame"

Greg,@Trapezoider Want to play melee?
Greg,You can't spell team without meta
Greg,i can play till 9 30
Greg,db6385d8
Greg,@Max
Greg,melee?
Greg,I dont have class till 12
Greg,@Trapezoider Sure you still here?
Greg,461a67c7
Greg,max I need to wait a few mins before I can play
Greg,So my parents can leave
Greg,okay
Greg,join when ready
Greg,kk
Greg,what matchups do you wanna do
Greg,When your parents leave can you join voice?
Greg,also is genesis tomorrow
Greg,No I can play
Greg,Wen I went down
Greg,They told me not to play games
Greg,So I gotta wait
Greg,Genesis is this weekend
Greg,early events may start thursday or friday though
Greg,I am probably going to start on falco
Greg,kk
Greg,After that we can play Shiek Falcon
Greg,kk
Greg,@Max
Greg,yeah?
Greg,"random thought - we have the term 'shot dead' for someone who is shot, and dies from it, but we don't have similar terms for other ways of dying or getting killed"
Greg,no 'stabbed dead' or 'drowned dead' or 'heart attacked dead'
Greg,english is weird
Greg,we're the only language where a double positive can result in a negative
Greg,wait how
Greg,yeah right
Greg,lol
Greg,I will still hold up verbal quebecois french as the most comprehensive idiomatic butchering of a language
Greg,four twenties ten 
Greg,naw that's just the language
Greg,I'm aware
Greg,I'm talking more the degree to which they mash english in and randomly remove syllables
Greg,fuck saying 'petit' (small) let's just say 'tit
Greg,"fuck saying 'voiture' (car), two syllables is too many let's just use the english word for it"
Greg,le tit snow
Greg,"also, in some rural regions in quebec they just randomly add 'la la' to the end of every sentence despite it having no semantic meaning within the sentence"
Greg,also they invented a completely separate set of swear words
Greg,which results in some truly unique cussing that you just don't really get to see in english
Greg,"because they'll mash together quebecois swearing, french swearing, and english swearing"
Greg,cause each language's/dialect's swearing has different stuff that's considered swearing so you can get really inventive
Greg,I've almost paid for pubg by selling crates
Greg,Nice
Greg,How much dollar
Greg,I haven't been playing since the update so no crates for me
Greg,Also Jed can you hang this weekend irl?
Greg,I'm at like $20
Greg,and idk
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,yikes
Greg,Were you heavily invested in cryptocurrencies @Trapezoider ?
Greg,what caused the crypto bubble to finally burst?
Greg,"dammit. I had a controller coming in for a bunch of fighting game stuff, was supposed to arrive tomorrow, but they showed up today only no one was home cause it wasn't supposed to come till tomorrow so they just took it back till tomorrow"
Greg,it literally changed nothing from my expectations but I could have had it tonight and that makes me mad
Greg,"fuck you too psychology, why'd you invent loss aversion"
Greg,I'm not sure whats happening today but I just had a perfect game in rivals the other guy didn't even touch me
Greg,everything seemed really slow
Greg,"I've only ever had one such game. They are rare and special, I hope you enjoyed it."
Greg,so I put a sandwich in the toster oven (wanted to heat the insides too)
Greg,"the top slice of bread, the one exposed to the air, burned to a crisp"
Greg,"the bottom one, the one pressed against the hot metal?"
Greg,"lightly toasted, slightly damp"
Greg,I do not understand thermodynamics
Greg,@Trapezoider Still interested in melee tonight?
Greg,duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude
Greg,"I just won a solo
I dropped gun range and went to bunker but someone was there so I went for a uaz
but a dude was already in it so I said wait no can I get a ride with you and he stopped and let me in and he was like where are you from and he was chinese and it worked so perfectly like we ran at the last guy and he died and then the other guy got zone boned"
Greg,@deleted-role

Greg,also let this be a lesson to work on your mentality
Greg,if you took my lessons seriously you would be way better
Greg,mentality isn't a joke
Greg,if you don't mind getting bodied you'll play way better
Greg,was a huge turning point for me
Greg,I mind getting bodied by someone who has been playing for 1/32 the amount of time I have
Greg,huge ego destruction
Greg,"like if you watch the handful of sets I'm on stream, I'm laughing at myself and me getting bodied and silly things"
Greg,going in with a positive attitude literally makes everything better
Greg,be happy for the other person doing sick stuff to you
Greg,"and afterwards consider what you could have done better, what worked, and what didn't"
Greg,keep the negativity for analyzing yourself later
Greg,The reason you are not good with your number of hours is because your hours are not meaningful. They are just random friendlies. You don't watch as many tournaments as Kameron (which I consider to be very important) so he knows how top level players move and combo. He also takes advice all the time while you just want to play a specific way and are too stubborn.
Greg,@Mr. Airplane I challenge you to a best of 9 set january 27th at 11pm EST
Greg,why an even number
Greg,do best of 7 or 9

Greg,"long story short, shit blew up and my bag is full of and covered in food"
Greg,including egg yolk
Greg,which has sunk into the fabric
Greg,this backpack is officially fucked
Greg,I guess instead of getting work done and going to office hours I'm instead going to have to go way out of my way to somewhere they sell backpacks and get a new one
Greg,RIP Sylki's backpack~ Unknown-2018
Greg,amazon same day delivery
Greg,I'm barely gonna be home today and if you miss the delivery stuff gets weird here
Greg,and I'd have ot go way out of my way to the UPS place to pick it up
Greg,Here they just leave it at the door
Greg,Same
Greg,unless its something super expensive like a phone
Greg,student housing is too sketchy for that here
Greg,like anything could get stolen
Greg,"also, rough backpack lifespan is like 2011-2018"

Greg,any of the good m2k plup sets
Greg,Sweet. I'll review those on my lunch break
Greg,Sylki do you ever miss classes?
Greg,occasionally
Greg,I don't recommend it
Greg,my basic rule is I will skip review classes of stuff I already know really well or early morning classes if I get less than 5 hours of sleep
Greg,or classes where the prof is so legendarily awful that it's easier and faster to skip the class and read the slides
Greg,That's a good rule to follow. I had to miss one today and I kinda wanted To die.
Greg,Ugh my teachers are lazy and don't make slides
Greg,just make sure yoou catch up on what you missed
Greg,Thankfully we have blackboard and I can do everything from I class online. Do you guys use blackboard?
Greg,nope

Greg,k
Greg,Brb
Greg,dem custom skins are wack
Greg,true
Greg,mostly don't look like what they say they look like
Greg,also it'll take one hell of a skin to make me give up on my coral kragg
Greg,coral krag?
Greg,
Greg,@Trapezoider coral kragg
Greg,I always get a bit sad looking at the really nice custom skins I have for characters I never play -_-
Greg,god this assignment is annoying
Greg,"""There is no solution to this. Just try to find the closest thing you can."""
Greg,and it's not like math where you can get an answer that still has some variables in it
Greg,there's literally no way to get from the starting point to an equivilant - if vague - end point
Greg,@here games?
Greg,maybe in a bit I've got a bit more work to do
Greg,cool-cool
Greg,
Greg,@Zain I'll preorder as soon as you do
Greg,but I thought you had to preorder it before the closed beta started
Greg,but idk
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL if you pre order now you get into the closed beta everyone is playing right now but I don't think am gonna buy it cuz it ends in like 2 days I'll prob buy it when I comes out
Greg,I have found a kragg skin that I would replace my coral kragg with
Greg,shame you have to buy it
Greg,
Greg,Now I'm hungry.
Greg,Yeah burrito kragg is cool
Greg,oh also kameron a top etalus confirmed with me that orcane beats etalus
Greg,no word on orcane kragg yet though
Greg,Once you get to the top tho matchups matter less
Greg,Still true tho
Greg,I somehow ended up in a weird roa discord for ontario/quebec and it seems pretty chill
Greg,also we might be entering a crew in a tournament where the winning team gets burrito kragg skins
Greg,I doubt I'm good enough to be on the crew though
Greg,What's the name of it?
Greg,it's only for ontario/quebec people
Greg,so I doubt you're in it
Greg,Aight
Greg,Just know there's a crew tourny coming up that my crews gonna be in
Greg,aight now I have to try to get into this crew if it's the same tournament
Greg,I want to die
Greg,I just spent 20 minutes debugging a four-line program
Greg,how
Greg,the problem was I used the wrong kind of quotation marks
Greg,...
Greg,"' ' instead of "" """
Greg,fuck haskell
Greg,like if its 4 lines id literally jsut rewrite hte htiung
Greg,I did
Greg,it still didn't work
Greg,cause apparently haskell's picky about your quotation marks
Greg,but the error message won't tell you that htat's the problem
Greg,it was telling me the problem was on the line after that
Greg,well i mean wanting you to actually use quotation marks rather than apostrophes isnt really picky
Greg,every other language I've ever used doesn't care
Greg,they've always been the same thing
Greg,but now they're not
Greg,and I can't tell what the actual difference is
Greg,i spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why my program kept skipping an input and realized i have a buffer overflow
Greg,ah that's always fun
Greg,@Rivals of Aether GOML 2018 might have RoA
Greg,Nice
Greg,anyone who might show if it does? cause apparently they're trying to gauge interest atm

Greg,@Sak von Sak is the crew tourny you're talking about called the frozen burrito?
Greg,yaw
Greg,sadly the ontario discord had already put a team in so I can't even challenge someone for a slot
Greg,might make my own crew
Greg,Yeah it's not exclusive to canada
Greg,didn't think it was?
Greg,just that we were gonna put out a local(ish) crew
Greg,I thought you said it was only for Toronto/Quebec or whatevrt

Greg,Okay well is kameron in? We could use Ava as our sub and just hope no one cancels
Greg,sub for what?
Greg,The rivals of Aether tournament
Greg,I'm in a crew @Sak von Sak
Greg,well if we get max and a sub we're still fine
Greg,Silky can you sign us up then because I'm at school  and I won't be home till after the deadline

Greg,@Max @Feral Nebula max will you play for us and ava will you sub. You probably wont have toplay but if you for some reason do
Greg,could you?
Greg,when is it?
Greg,it's spread over next week
Greg,presumably in the evenings
Greg,we probably won't need you but you have to sign up with four and a sub
Greg,"sure, I guess I'll sub. I'm not that good at the game though so if I do play I'll probably lose"
Greg,don't worry about that we're probably gonna go 0-2 no matter who's playing

Greg,need to finish a lab and shower but after that I'd be down
Greg,how long do you think thatll be?
Greg,hour or two
Greg,not sure how long the lab's gonna take
Greg,"and especially because it's a programming thing built around a concept I've never actually used before, it could be super simple or take ages"
Greg,this is some of the worst debugging I've ever written
Greg,there's so much redundant stuff
Greg,but it was useful like half an hour ago
Greg,and I'm afraid to delete it in case it becomes useful half an hour from now
Greg,@Melee I got invited to the Icons closed beta! I'm under NDA though so please don't ask me questions about the game.
Greg,what is nda
Greg,non disclosure agreement
Greg,Also what is this game?
Greg,A melee style fighting game
Greg,Max is that the good news?
Greg,yes
Greg,oh my god I want to kill myself
Greg,fuck semaphores

Greg,fuck it this isn't due till tuesday I'm done for today

Greg,"I've been debugging this for an hour and a half and it's a constant 'one step forwards, two steps back'"
Greg,you know what I always say @Sak von Sak
Greg,programming isn't real
Greg,I feel you
Greg,the sooner you realize this the sooner you can accept it
Greg,yo the rivals character select screen is organised by element type
Greg,totally just realised that
Greg,Dude
Greg,so the last character will be air
Greg,I knew that
Greg,And I don't play
Greg,shhh\
Greg,@Jed you wanna try out that weird version of rivals with me?
Greg,sure
Greg,"alright, technically I can beat jed"
Greg,"practically, it takes like 15 tries and a lot of salt"
Greg,ranno's jank
Greg,so are platforms
Greg,but not at the same time
Greg,the count was 11-3 or
Greg,but some of those were sylvanos
Greg,yeah at least one of them was us seeing if sylvanos jab spikes
Greg,and you killed yourself three times in like twenty seconds
Greg,oh true
Greg,"still, once I was more warmed up we had close matches"
Greg,I would have won that one kragg one if I hadn't killed myself by fastfalling next to the stage instead of onto it at like 20%
Greg,Icons is fun
Greg,I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT FUN RIGHT NOW

Greg,@Max
Greg,are the numbers you chose for peoples id's random or do they have meaning
Greg,My plan was to never actually mention what someones number was but others have given specific numbers. I would guess that they are random but you should check with whoever wrote the chapter.
Greg,okay just making sure no one has some foreshadowing on those numbers or a purpose to them
Greg,In college business class
Greg,professor asks someone to give description of what supply and demand means
Greg,I give description

Greg,I cannot believe the synchronis landing cycle was successful
Greg,This just set multiple records
Greg,I believe this is the first car to be launched into space
Greg,On the most powerful rocket
Greg,Thats also reusable
Greg,And was also funded and researched by a private citizen
Greg,cant wait till spaceman makes it to mars
Greg,Im so curious if the mainfcore made it to the drone ship
Greg,Im checking every news feed possible and space
Greg,x'x twitter but no one has news
Greg,I NEED TO KNOW
Greg,Do you guys get why im such an elon fan now?
Greg,Yeah how long till the core comes down?
Greg,It should have come down 7 minutes ago
Greg,Oh
Greg,"They lost signal due to interferences though
And they cut off the stream before confirmation"
Greg,Im super triggered

Greg,That was dumb

Greg,I am creating the DC calendar
Greg,Let's get these dates locked down ASAP
Greg,dont you already know mine?
Greg,Ye but send me your schedule
Greg,For summer
Greg,@Zain @Feral Nebula @Trapezoider @Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane @The Rona The spreadsheet has been made and should be in your email
Greg,"So bros, my parents track my phone and are super oedipal and annoying about knowing where I am. Today however I found a very convienient app that can spoof my location. :) Life just got a lot better"
Greg,lol gg dude
Greg,
Greg,on a scale from 1 to tm06 how toxic is this
Greg,@Homiesgames?
Greg,"andrew, I feel for you and all, but I'm pretty sure oedipal is not the right word"
Greg,oedipus (or however you spell it) was the guy who banged his mum and killed his dad
Greg,I'm gonna assume you just meant anal
Greg,"as in anal retentitive, as in super control-freak-y"
Greg,if you can spoof your location you can fool your parents but also think of how easy it would be to play pokemon go
Greg,@here games?
Greg,shut the heck up
Greg,ok
Greg,"apparently, if every chicken dinner in pubg was an actual chicken dinner, enough have occurred that you could feed the population of iceland for a year"
Greg,I don't know who goes through the trouble of figuring this stuff out
Greg,but it's great
Greg,@Sak von Sak melee or pubg or somethin?
Greg,naw studying atm
Greg,kk
Greg,got midterms next week
Greg,@Sak von Sak post that canada pic about the population
Greg,what if he don't
Greg,i cri
Greg,I don't have it
Greg,it was never me
Greg,pretty sure ocean man's got it
Greg,@Sak von Sak pretty sure oedipal was the word I was looking for. In my context it means the helicopter mother and father who are emotionally dependant on me and take away responsibility I should have for myself by being over protective and over bearing
Greg,dude raisins are gay
Greg,craisins however
Greg,NUT
Greg,but that's not what happened in the story
Greg,
Greg,he was abandoned
Greg,I'm not talking about the story????
Greg,cause prophecy saying he'd kill his dad and murder his mum
Greg,It's a word from frued
Greg,but that's where the term comes from?
Greg,he used it in the context of the story
Greg,Pretty sure it's from civilization and it's discontents
Greg,oedipos complex is freud's thing
Greg,Oedipos and oedipal are different
Greg,http://www.dictionary.com/browse/oedipal
Greg,the definition of oedipal
Greg,https://youtu.be/EPAfS8-wm8g
Greg,Jordan Peterson: Female Pathology (The Oedipal Mother)
Greg,Full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek
Greg,I think we're having a definitional mismtach here
Greg,I need to update my knowledge of this topic
Greg,'spose they're different meanings for the same word
Greg,I was running off that video essentially
Greg,"but in common perception, oedipus-related stuff immediately goes the mother-fucking route"
Greg,LOL
Greg,a statement which is based in a different psychologist's work -_-
Greg,"Yeah I read your definition and I was like ""fuuuuccckk"""
Greg,Basically sees his dad as a sexual rival lmao
Greg,jung get out of our freud-based discussion dammit
Greg,That's fucked up dude
Greg,Yeah get the fuck out Jung
Greg,eh I like Jung's stuff honestly
Greg,who tf is Jung?
Greg,Fucking coming in here with your collective unconscience
Greg,Stupid bitch
Greg,"well the main thing is the idea of the collective unconscience, which is ironically usually misunderstood"
Greg,Jed he was essentially Sigmund Freud 2.0
Greg,aight
Greg,"the way jung has it is that it's the collection of ideas, archetypes, and such that are common to basically everyone - symbols that pretty much everyone will understand and associate with the same things"
Greg,"amusingly, the collective unconscience is often represented as a literal collective, shared part of the uncounscious mind that is in some way attached between people"
Greg,so the collective unconscience isn't really a part of the collective unconscience
Greg,"also Jung and Freud were pretty different in how they approached stuff, from what I remember"
Greg,although Jung did carry on some of Freud's stuff I'm pretty sure mmost of his theories were pretty different
Greg,it's been awhile since I took psych so I'm gonna go dig this up
Greg,While we wait for sylkis notes
Greg,@Rivals of Aether Jed?
Greg,for a little bit
Greg,sylki do you know a rivals player named sableye?
Greg,he is in Ontario I think
Greg,he's in that discord but other than that I dunno
Greg,aight
Greg,@Trapezoider get in nerd
Greg,"they both worked a lot with the unconscious, but Freud focused more on repressed, but still present stuff, as well as the id/ego/superego stuff and the kinda wacky psychosexual stuff for describing behaviour, whereas Jung focused more on the shared stuff between people, how we understand society and ourselves in relation to it"
Greg,sadly one of the major reasons I remember as much about Jung as I do is that the persona games kinda swooped in and built a lot of the series off his theories (especially Personas 4&5) - Jung is literally the guy who came up with the term 'Persona' in the way that it's generally used today

Greg,go be a lifeguard
Greg,Easy money
Greg,I dont know what certifications are in canada
Greg,But here in the states
Greg,EZ
Greg,only have my bronze medal and TBH im not fit enough to get the cross rn
Greg,oh in canada you need to complete 3 seperate 12 week courses
Greg,so ive done two
Greg,havent finished the third
Greg,for lifeguard shit?
Greg,Damn canada
Greg,yeah
Greg,well its your job to ensure safety of the public
Greg,Mine was one week of training/testing for certifcations
Greg,so id assume it'd be pretty hard
Greg,really?
Greg,damn america is wack
Greg,How long are the sessions?
Greg,2 hours
Greg,It was 8 hours a day for 5 days
Greg,but only once a week
Greg,oh
Greg,okay it comes out similar then
Greg,America is retarded but definitely not that retarded
Greg,"2x12x3=72
8x5=40"
Greg,TIL you cant use * to show multiplication on discord
Greg,Ye i just checked my calculator because something didnt seem right with me saying they were close
Greg,32 hour difference
Greg,LYike
Greg,TBH you can easily cover it all in 32 hours especially if you have them back to back
Greg,so its not that wack
Greg,40*
Greg,my issue i couldn't finish was hte distance swim
Greg,i mean i did finish it
Greg,but barely
Greg,how long?
Greg,300 m right?
Greg,1600m in 12 mins
Greg,did you have to do the brick?
Greg,100m pool 16 lengths
Greg,oh yeah the brick was fine
Greg,Brick = ez
Greg,the brick was weird cause you could jsut stand on the bottom
Greg,without floating back up
Greg,TF?
Greg,We did it in the deep end
Greg,yeah no im saying
Greg,when you are at the bottom of the pool usually you float up
Greg,@Max Melee?
Greg,but with the brick you can just stay on the bottom
Greg,so it felt weird
Greg,Oh yeah
Greg,I like chilling on the bottom with the brick
Greg,same
Greg,Sneaky snekking my way around
Greg,Grabbing peoples legs
Greg,we always had to cram the swimming stuff in the first hour cause for the second hour the synchro team would take like half hte pool
Greg,so it meant even when our instructor was just talking to us we had to focus on not sinking since we could only have the deep end
Greg,Are you going to complete your certs?
Greg,i really should
Greg,@Trapezoider how do I aquire such a test drive
Greg,go on the website and apply
Greg,here ill send link
Greg,wait shit you have to be 21. I need to cancel 
Greg,Lmao
Greg,Rip
Greg,finishing your certs isn't that that hard
Greg,so long as you have decent eggbeater you're fine
Greg,I got mine and then never managed to actually get a lifeguarding job -_-
Greg,now they're pretty much all expired
Greg,I'd have to do all the hardest ones all over again
Greg,mango is at the cs_summit
Greg,eggbeater?
Greg,treading water with legs only technique
Greg,super useful for carrying people
Greg,especially for spinals where you have to move at a constant pace or risk causing way more damage
Greg,@Trapezoider for spinals do they teach the Canadian hold thingy in the states?
Greg,.+
Greg,for spinals we actually use a backboard and try to stabilize as best we can until the backboard can be used
Greg,The goal is to get the person into shallow water and maintain stability of the spinal erector and neck
Greg,Since we dont really know the extent of a given injury
Greg,Man sylki you and I become more and more similar the more i get to know you
Greg,
Greg,wait did they not teach you spinal carry stuff for before you can get them to the board?
Greg,They did but I dont remember 
Greg,dammit now I don't get to know if they taught you canadian carry
Greg,which they'd better have cause it's the best
Greg,I have no idea :(
Greg,

Greg,highest HP boss in the history of gaming:
Greg,
Greg,I see your boss and raise you http://xenoblade.wikia.com/wiki/Gradivus%2C_the_Headless_Emperor
Greg,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor"
Greg,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor (Japanese: 首無皇帝グラデウス, Kubinashi Kōtei Guradeusu) is a Tyrant in Xenoblade Chronicles X. It is a member of the Millesaur family. It can be found at level 71 at the..."
Greg,"100,000,040 health"
Greg,also for the record this is a lv71 enemy in a game where the level cap is 60
Greg,i see your boss and I raise you again (i found this on reddit)
Greg,also where'd the extra 40 come from on that xenoblade boss?
Greg,no idea
Greg,but that is its health
Greg,the post-game bosses in this game are stupidly strong
Greg,cause there's a lot of weird optimization stuff
Greg,there's a boss that's 39 levels above the level cap
Greg,ie a lv99 when your max level is 60
Greg,that I can understand a little because they wanted to make it like other RPGs where the level cap is 99
Greg,"I tried taking it on as a joke at lv56, I got one shot"
Greg,tpk in one hit
Greg,you have to optimize so hard to win
Greg,I remember one time I took on a boss (which I didn't think was a secret boss) at a low level and I got one shot. I took me about three days to realize that he actually was a secret boss.
Greg,"I generally try to stay away from RPGs that require the use of so many complicated game mechanics (like optimizations, synthesising, equipment boosting, etc). Most of the ones I play have them, but I can ignore them and still manage to beat the game (main story at least)."
Greg,main story's totally manageable without any particular optimization
Greg,but they left some crazy stuff in for the crazy people
Greg,so they'd have some ridiculous completionist challenge
Greg,"yeah. For me, I just really only play games for their story aspect. If I really enjoyed it I'll go back and try to 100% it."
Greg,"same, but I do think it's cool"
Greg,also the particular crazy enemies are super interesting in terms of design and lore in this game
Greg,"intersting. I've never tried a Xenoblade game, but now I'm curious. Any recommandations to start with?"
Greg,start with the original
Greg,if you've got a wiiu/switch I think you can get it on the virtual console
Greg,xbc1 is one of my top 2 rpgs
Greg,I don't have a wiiu or a switch
Greg,ooooor you can just emulate it
Greg,unless you want to pay like $100 for a wii copy
Greg,yeha no thanks
Greg,xbcx is pretty good but it's more worldbuilding and sidequests than a direct story
Greg,haven't played xbc2 cause I don't have a switch
Greg,"also I don't know how the timeline of xbc1 and 2 work, but xbcx is totally separate"
Greg,is xb a wiiu/switch specific game?
Greg,it's nintendo specific
Greg,ah that explains it
Greg,"original was wii, X was wiiu, 2 is switch"
Greg,I'm really more of a ps fan
Greg,have you played any of the persona games?
Greg,I wanted to play persona 4 but I wasn't old enough when it came out. I DESPERATELY want to play Persona 5! I looks SOO COOL!
Greg,god p5 is good
Greg,it's the other of my two favourite rpgs
Greg,if you've got ps3 I think there's versions of personas 3-5
Greg,"p3 has versions for ps2, ps3, and psp, p4 for ps2 and ps3, and p5 for ps3 and ps4"
Greg,i have both a 3 and a 4 so I'm kinda in luck
Greg,yeee get p5
Greg,I'm trying to
Greg,is it hard to find a copy? or just not enough money?
Greg,not enough money
Greg,aw
Greg,just starve yourself for a week
Greg,it's worth it
Greg,lol
Greg,"btw, if you like persona 5, are you going to watch the animation coming out soon? Just curious?"
Greg,yup
Greg,"if possible I'd recommend playing before watching, the adaptations are a little less deep"
Greg,and especially in the case of p4 the pacing's wack
Greg,that is if they don't change the story progression first
Greg,both adaptations have been pretty faithful
Greg,I remember one of my favorite games got an anime adaption and it complete changed how the game was
Greg,slight changes to accomadate the protagonist not being a player-insert character
Greg,"but other than that, consistent"
Greg,admittadly the faithfulness is what caused the p4 adaptation to be weirdly paced
Greg,well yeah they kinda have to cram the possibly 20+ hour game into a 12 episode season
Greg,that sounds like it would end badly
Greg,"i wouldn't if they divided it over 2 seasons, which the anime adaption of my favorite game did but poorly"
Greg,20+ hours should probably be 50 episodes at least
Greg,"most likely, but you got to think, most of that time is possibly running around looking for what your doing, travel time, and filler content"
Greg,true
Greg,so theoetically it would really be 10-15 hours
Greg,"with persona games pre-5, they were like 60ish hours but a lot (probably 20-25 hours) was storyless combat, and they always have to trim side stuff (which is a lot of persona games), but they manage to fit just about all the important stuff in"
Greg,and that's what important. Though I don't mind the occational filler episode since they're the funniest
Greg,p4's got great filler
Greg,"cause it's so character focused, it doesn't even feel like filler"
Greg,I don't even know why you would put filler in a movie
Greg,movie where'd that come from? (and you wouldn't)
Greg,Persona 4's adaptation is a movie I think?
Greg,no it's an anime
Greg,naw that's backwards
Greg,"p4 is a 25 episode anime, p3 is 4(?) movies"
Greg,"but yeah, fillers can be good, as long as they progress the story or develop the characters even a little amongest all the fan service"
Greg,one of the p3 movies has one of the best hot springs bit I've ever seen
Greg,there's plenty of character development but it's also just funny
Greg,and not much fanservice
Greg,one of my favorite fan service bits from a game was a hot springs bonus scene from a game called Tales of Xillia 2. Oh my god it's freaking hallarious! You really don't even need to understand the game to think it's funny
Greg,basically what happens is the guys are swallowed by this living doll (that's actualyl a party member) because the girls didn't want them around. And they end up getting digested in the doll's stomach. It's the dialogue that makes it funny

Greg,release it now as well
Greg,on some non trapezoid yt
Greg,kk
Greg,just got in like a ten minute argument of me vs the majority of the ontario rivals discord about discord light vs discord dark
Greg,I have successfully convinced them that it's ok to use the light theme
Greg,so now hopefully no one's gonna get on my case for using it
Greg,Fuck you Sylki. I do not like you because you use white discord
Greg,that's racist
Greg,you don't like me cause I like white
Greg,"in all seriousness there are valid arguments against white, but 'it's too bright it hurts my eyes' is BS"
Greg,"it's the exact same white as like, everything else on your computer"
Greg,"behold, a screenshot of discord, where part of the picture is a screenshot of a word document"
Greg,IT'S THE EXACT SAME COLOUR
Greg,Ack! My eyes!
Greg,It burns
Greg,^
Greg,thai food is dope
Greg,uwu
Greg,Thai food is infact dope
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,Join the master race. Discord white is superior and all of the discord dark people can  kiss my ass
Greg,ew gross I didnt know you used discord light
Greg,we're not friends anymore
Greg,eat ass
Greg,no
Greg,go die
Greg,smoke grass
Greg,
Greg,and sled fast
Greg,
Greg,"""Sled fast, eat ass"" - Dan the Meme man"
Greg,"brief reasons why I use discord light:
1) anyone who says it's too bright is fucking stupid. It's the same white as everything else on your computer that uses white - word, facebook, google, etc. - and you can clearly manage it just fine there.
2) my eyes are borked and reading light text on dark background gives me brutal headaches if I do it for too long, which happened a bunch when I tried out discord dark.
These are objective facts. You can say you think discord dark looks better and that's fine, but don't try to tell me that it's too bright and don't tell me I should give myself brutal headaches to match your aesthetic sense."
Greg,Why do guys care about this so much?
Greg,It doesn't even matter.
Greg,except I have applied a dark skin to a majority of my web services
Greg,^
Greg,"I only care cause any time I put a screenshot up everyone goes 'ew discord light' and I feel victimized, you monsters"
Greg,and I always have discord up on my other monitor so it does tend to feel bright
Greg,so I feel the need to explain that due to actual physical problems discord light is better for me
Greg,There is nothing wrong with light
Greg,also I get annoyed at the 'it's too bright' thing
Greg,yeah that's fair
Greg,light's not right
Greg,but people like trap who just use it cause they are dumb
Greg,thats who we can make fun of
Greg,I still think it's dumb to make fun of people for preferring a different visual style
Greg,unelss they think ping pong the animation looks good
Greg,in which case hell yeah I'll make fun of them
Greg,hypocrisy intensifies

Ok everyone I know drowned in pools"
Greg,wait actually Dad made top 24
Greg,I'm not quite sure how because based on the bracket he just randomly appeared in loser's round of 24 and then lost 2-3
Greg,"he's not in any round before that, in winner's or loser's"
Greg,this bracket's super weird
Greg,it looks like a few people I know made it out of pools
Greg,but they all seem to appear in the main bracket at different places
Greg,and they all immediately lost

Greg,
Greg,@Eric Working From Home if you give me the entire file i can help you out
Greg,http://puu.sh/zx0Tf/c88135a0d2.zip
Greg,"Yeah you can summon a group of objects in Java, but can you summon Lord cuthulu?"
Greg,summonLordCuthulu();
Greg,you're need to create an object to call the method
Greg,so
Greg,"AbyssalLord C = new AbyssalLord;
C.summonLordCuthulu();"

Greg,I forgot my mic is broken
Greg,sorry
Greg,@Zain @Bitmin We are going to be playing a new social deception game later tonight if either of you wants to join
Greg,it's hella fun you should join us
Greg,I'll hopefully be able to acquire a working mic by then
Greg,is it coup
Greg,yup
Greg,Can I join too?
Greg,sure
Greg,depending on how many we get we may need to split into two groups
Greg,is there a maximum number of players?
Greg,more than 4 would be awkward I think
Greg,you can't play with more than 7 but at that point it's a complete and total mess
Greg,why?
Greg,more than 4/5 would be hard
Greg,I want to keep it civil
Greg,"too many things to keep track of the more people you add, also you start running out of cards"
Greg,I think that having more people would be better because you can use the cards people have discarded by dying to try and figure out if someone's lying or not
Greg,The more players there are the less turns you get and the less each player matters
Greg,also you can't use cards people died and left behind
Greg,i suppose thats true
Greg,Okay but boys whats up with this http://puu.sh/zxS8Y/c9282f5e8f.png
Greg,too late

Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture. One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.

When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school, while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends. Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the shadows of his past.

Greg,time to pray for lenient prof
Greg,I have a 12% assignment due tonight that I've been brick walling since monday
Greg,but I've missed office hours because I'm sick
Greg,so I'm totally fucked
Greg,I sent him an email and hopefully he'll extend it for me or just drop it entirely
Greg,but we'll see
Greg,Good luck my dude
Greg,How fooked are you if he doesnt help you out here?
Greg,What class is this for?
Greg,"it's scientific computing, which is a brutal class (super wacky linear algebra mixed with programming)"
Greg,and I'm really fucked if he doesn't help me out
Greg,because I was super duper behind and got a 0 on the previous assignment and a 0 on the previous test
Greg,like I'm currently failing the course
Greg,not because I don't get it but because I fell super far behind last time I was sick
Greg,"Sylki, I'm here for you my man. If you need to study for a test thats like memorization stuff I'll do online flash card review with you. I don't know the concepts but I can question you on then if you give me a review packet. Also can you give me a basic rundown on what linear algebra is, how it different from normal algebra, and what's it's current applications in computer science are? I have heard a lot of the deep mind guys talk about linear algebra having direct technical uses in machine learning"
Greg,"For optimizing ""fitness functions."" I barely understand any of this shit, so please enlighten my .0001% understanding"
Greg,Linear algebra is about vectors
Greg,In layman terms
Greg,"Okay the only context I understand vectors in is when closed cycle rocket engine ""vectors"" it's thrust to change directions"
Greg,Is there any analogy you can draw from that to the maths?
Greg,Its mostly about representing linear equations from what I understand
Greg,yes but that's a super simple way of thinking about it
Greg,it's basically super wack math that's not really analogous to anything else at the point I'm at
Greg,"in terms of usage, it's really good for machine learning and data analysis"

This game should appeal to a much wider audience, so even if you didn't like MCG, I would appreciate if you gave this one a try. The game will be having its first playtest tonight. Anyone who wants in please let me know!"
Greg,Sure I can be there.
Greg,what time?
Greg,"No defined time yet, I will provide an update on the time once I have a better idea how much longer production is going to take."
Greg,@everyone Development of Combo Colors is now complete. I'm aiming to have the playtest at 6:30 CST so try to show up around then if you want to try it out.
Greg,"Just so you know, this game is not strictly a 1v1 game. It can be played with 2-4 players."

Greg,Tfw you think you're getting tinitus but then you track the high pitched ringing sound to your refrigerator
Greg,LOL
Greg,that is such a thing I would do
Greg,Tfw you've always had tinitus and thought that everyone else did too
Greg,How would you even figure out that everyone else doesn't?
Greg,I mentioned it to my mom one time like last year and she was like oh yeah that's not normal
Greg,Hey that's how I figured out it was a problem that I mostly only looked out of one eye
Greg,"Dominant eye is a thing, but it's not supposed to be that dominant"
Greg,But I didn't realize that until I told someone about it
Greg,how do you only look out of one eye ??
Greg,Long years of unintentionally trainin myself
Greg,Probably stemming from having had a lazy eye when I was really young
Greg,I've had to manually retrain myself the last two ish years
Greg,And its kinda sucked (lots of headaches)
Greg,But I'm pretty much fixed now except when I start to get really tired or spend too much time frequently changing focus
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,I shouldnt expect to have this correctly?
Greg,How do I test if I do?
Greg,Itd probably cost you but you could get it checked out by an optometrist
Greg,"In general though, you should be aware of the ability to swap focus between each of your eyes while pretty much completely ignoring the other, and a difficulty using both at once"
Greg,"A good simple test - hold two pencils out in front of your nose, one roughly 8-10 inches away and the other 2-3 times that. Focus on the close one, and in your non-focused field of view you should see two versions of the far pencil. Don't worry of this doesn't pop up immediately or if it's hard to look for the split while keeping your focus on the close one, worry if you can't do it at all or if it's really hard to get the split."
Greg,It's not a perfect test but it's something I had to train myself to be able to do and apparently it's a pretty normal thing most people can do
Greg,is it good or bad to get the split?
Greg,Good
Greg,Cause that means both eyes are focused up close
Greg,it happens pretty much automatically for me
Greg,"And since they both have different angles to the far one, it creates the split"
Greg,Yeah you're fine then
Greg,"Out of curiosity, are you able to unsplit while keeping your focus close (ie doing what I used to do automatically)"
Greg,let me try
Greg,no not really
Greg,the only way to remove the split is to focus on the far one
Greg,that's super weird
Greg,"Well that's good, odds are you'll never fall into the same trap I did"
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,Seems like im good
Greg,Thank you for all the insight
Greg,Are you close to being fully healed?
Greg,More or less
Greg,It still kicks I occasionally and a few things with it are still messed up (including the reading white text on dark background thing) but overall it's pretty much better

Greg,Did anyone know that Doki Doki Literature Club is getting a second game?
Greg,"whaaat, I didn't"
Greg,is it official?
Greg,"Not yet, but Game Theroy made two videos breaking down Doki Doki and they concluded that it's getting a second game in 2018"
Greg,Based on Doki Doki's hidden backstory
Greg,I dunno if Game Theory has the authority to declare something like that 100%
Greg,More like gay theory tho
Greg,He wasn't the one who came up with it though. It was a whole ARG that people solved
Greg,"It's actually really cool and I'm super excited if this is true, which it most likely will be since they're pretty accurate with their theories"
Greg,@mrd256 can you link the vid?

Greg,it's kindof an eyesore
Greg,"either ariel, calibri, or cambria should be the primary font for scholarly works"
Greg,not times new roman
Greg,also 1.1-1.3 line spacing is much more asthetically pleasing than 1.5-2 line spacing
Greg,I'm a fan of Calibri myself.

Greg,that is not done yet though
Greg,its wip from the facebook page
Greg,bless
Greg,cause this book is super boring dude
Greg,hey
Greg,i need some weeb peoples opinions
Greg,@Feral Nebula @mrd256
Greg,so like we're having this debate
Greg,theres a lot more weebs than that here
Greg,do you think it was possible for hte people in SaO
Greg,to like
Greg,fuck
Greg,ingame
Greg,lol
Greg,why is that a topic of conversation
Greg,dont worry about it
Greg,it started off with some guy asking if he should get sea of thieves and we're here now
Greg,have you ever seen sao
Greg,ye
Greg,and they never definitivley answer
Greg,if you cna fuck or not
Greg,like
Greg,the main bitch strips then smacks the dude in the face
Greg,but thats as close as they get
Greg,Imma say yes
Greg,But I'm no weeb so my opinion doesn't hold much water
Greg,well considering she did strip chances are its possible
Greg,As long as they have genitals and can experience tactile sensations
Greg,okay so one of my main bitches linked me some SaO Smut and apparently its cannon that they can fuck
Greg,its not actually smut im like 80% sure its a cannon novel
Greg,but dont quote me
Greg,yeah but the whole point of the question is we don't know if they do or not @ trap
Greg,Did the girl who stripped have genitals?
Greg,for some reason I read that like the girl had her genitals stripped
Greg,she stripped to her underwear so its unclear
Greg,"so i got my boy james on the whole genital issue and all he said was ""idk they had dicks and pussies in the hentai i watched"""
Greg,james is high rn so hes not super helpful
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,okay so like
Greg,the other girls in the guild have fucked b4
Greg,so id assume they have genitals
Greg,tfw you play too much counter strike and get carpal tunnel
Greg,yo we should get some 8 man pubg going sometime
Greg,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Greg,Yo somebody kick this guy
Greg,Yo I just saw a police officer take somebody off a train with a m4 assult rifle and they say Canada dosent have guns lol but truthfully sorta spooked me a little
Greg,Where the fuck do you get an M4 in Canada?
Greg,Did the cop have it or the dude
Greg,fusion had it
Greg,Oh duh
Greg,the cop lol but yes i also have an m4
Greg,Arrest this man
Greg,^^

Greg,I mean I told you that
Greg,Yeah but one of their employees told me otherwise

Greg,Also I asked them about it in their discord and they were super condesending
Greg,@Jed wanna join a cs team? We lost a guy and need a lurk
Greg,I mean I'm kinda bad
Greg,Also what's the time commitment?
Greg,"I think we'd be playing around 4 nights a week. It would basically take up the free time you spent on rifles in pubg to some degree I imagine, but I still think it would be pretty fun to be on the team together. Especially since I'm not complete ass at the game now"
Greg,Prolly not

Greg,Eat shit moose fucker
Greg,Nah
Greg,You cross the border before you get to customs
Greg,"Wait you're wrong. If I was driving into Buffalo, I would be stopped by the US border. When I come back I would be stopped by the Canadian border"
Greg,"Y
Yeah no you cross into Canada before you get through customs"
Greg,There is a park n shit
Greg,You have to go through customs when crossing the border?
Greg,No after
Greg,You know what I mean
Greg,I mean like the booth where they ask you questions and shit
Greg,It just occured to me that you probably took a plane
Greg,Thought that qualifies as customs
Greg,Nah we drove
Greg,oh
Greg,Only like 7-8 hour drive
Greg,True
Greg,When you said customs I thought that you were referring to them checking your bags and stuff
Greg,Nah
Greg,They just asked like 5 questions and let us through
Greg,Yeah

Greg,IS LEFF BOUTA SAVE MELEE
Greg,die the villain or live long enough to become the hero
Greg,Is that a reference? It sounds like a line from something.

Greg,doing school work
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,I have defeated you
Greg,??
Greg,
Greg,???
Greg,I'm confused
Greg,it has something to do with fairy tail but other that I have no idea
Greg,"I just watched an episode of fairy tail where all the main characters turned into Batman. And they broke the fourth wall by saying ""oh no she's turned realistic"" considering such an odd episode I thought it might be funny enough to get you to watch so.e"
Greg,Some*
Greg,didn't work
Greg,Fuck
Greg,Nigerian whore sack
Greg,you're not supposed to start with saying you've defeated me
Greg,Somebody kick this guy
Greg,it encourages me to disprove you out of spite
Greg,also this wasn't particularly inspiring
Greg,Sylki I am determined to get you to watch this show
Greg,@Sak von Sak melee???
Greg,Sylki 1v1 me rust
Greg,"I'm more curious to know how DBZ wrangled its context to include the line ""Hold your fire, this man isn't black!"" with a straight face"
Greg,I can explain
Greg,If you watch fairy tail. I am a sucker for million episode shows
Greg,That never end :(
Greg,That is what long shows tend to do
Greg,Except fairy tail is over now
Greg,So is dbz
Greg,which is why they tend to suck
Greg,Except the movies that come out
Greg,"dragon ball is still going, dbz might be done"
Greg,Fairy tail definitely has some shitty story arcs not gonna lie
Greg,The highs are high but the lows are meh
Greg,"and my stance on super long shows is basically: I could watch several great short shows in this time, maybe I""ll do that instead"
Greg,What kind of show even is it?
Greg,the highs are bad the lows are terrible
Greg,why do you want someone to watch it with you so badly?
Greg,wait
Greg,ill watch it with you
Greg,i dont have anything better to do
Greg,@Trapezoider
Greg,"so I'm gonna watch made in abyss, and re creators, and higurashi, and grimgar, and monster, eureka 7, and your lie in april, and monster, and a fuck ton of other stuff first"
Greg,"""the highs are bad the lows are terrible"" ""I'll watch it with you"" MAKES SENSE"
Greg,am down to watch a bad show
Greg,I mean it can be fun to watch something with the intention of laughing at it
Greg,you still haven't finished made in abyss???
Greg,a gonna have fun making fun of it
Greg,see: me watching girls und panzer
Greg,ava I have watched like nothing in the last month and a half other than watching kill la kill with you and andrew

Greg,"Random thought: denotations of time make no sense. I mean days are reasonable - it's the time it takes to start dark, get light, then get dark again and you sleep in the middle - and so are years - turning of the seasons, earth going around the sun, etc. - but the rest are irrational. What is an hour? a minute? a second? a week? why do they fit so badly into each other? who designed this stupid system?"
Greg,Still better than the imperial system
Greg,I'm pretty sure the hour is used to tell the position of the sun
Greg,yeah but why are there 24 per dday
Greg,that's an arbitrary number
Greg,especially cause you can't see the sun for half the day
Greg,same thing with weeks
Greg,like I get it's pulled from god making the earth in seven days
Greg,but it's still weird
Greg,"at least months almost make sense cause thye're matched up to the cycles of the moon, sort of"
Greg,The system makes more or less sense depending on where you live
Greg,Also it takes 24 hours for the earth to complete one revolution on its center axis
Greg,yes but why TWENTY FOUR
Greg,like what is one hour that made us decide to use it as a measure of time? we have one day for one rotation of the earth
Greg,That doesn't not make 24 an arbiratry number trap
Greg,Yes it does
Greg,Because 24
Greg,>0
Greg,Get rekt
Greg,nerds
Greg,What
Greg,
Greg,Tfw ur mum gay
Greg,get  out of my christian minecraft server
Greg,Which one? @Jed
Greg,you heccin tard
Greg,@Jed
Greg,When are you back?
Greg,At like 6
Greg,The ur mum gay bit was aimed at trap
Greg,Because with his logic the gay clearly transferred
Greg,Yeah
Greg,gay traps > octagons and doctors
Greg,This just in the entire medical community is deemed worth less than one gay trap
Greg,@Sak von Sak time is done the way it is because it is in a base 6 number system
Greg,"60 seconds

Greg,When?
Greg,4-4:30 PST is start time
Greg,@Jed
Greg,Buy that esea my guy. Ill pay you at the gym tomorrow
Greg,@deleted-role I have created a meetup planning document. Please join it.
Greg,"on my exam today I wrote one of the most disgusting single lines of code of my life, which I will try to replicate here:"
Greg,| mod (length list) 2 != 0 = take (((length list)/2) - 0.5) (zipWith (+) list (reverse list)) : (head (reverse (take (((length list)/2)+0.5) list)))
Greg,it's highly efficient but it's such a mess
Greg,What does this even do?
Greg,"A direct translation of what it's doing: it checks to see if the length of a list is divisible by two, and if it isn't, it takes the first half (rounded down) values from a new list that it creates where each element is the sum of an element in the list plus that same position in the list if the list was backwards, and then concatenates that to the first value of the reverse of the first half (rounded up) values in the original list

A more straightforward explanation: if a list cannot be divided into two halves of equal length, it creates a new list where each element is the sum of the list folded over onto itself (so the first value plus the last, the second value plus the second last, etc., and the final value is just the middle value)"
Greg,"normally I would not do that in a single line, but in haskell you kinda sorta gotta unless you want to write ten times as much code"
Greg,I originally wrote out the whole function (which is more than just that) as way more code but I had spare time so I decided to write out the more efficient version I figured out halfway through an unrelated question later on the exam
Greg,I condensed like a page of code into three extremely disgusting lines
Greg,of which that was the worst
Greg,Damn son
Greg,also I get to cheerfully come home and start studying for my monday exam -_-
Greg,"someone put together a single slide deck of all the slides the prof said to study, and this is on the first slide"
Greg,fuck me

Greg,4b99e5e8
Greg,7c6998b8

Greg,@Zain thats too bad
Greg,@Zain sorry buddy :(
Greg,Are you getting hit by this storm as well @Zain
Greg,Does anyone know if hereditary memes can change the gene pool of a population to express different phenotypes more or less?
Greg,Memes are not hereditary
Greg,Hereditary memes?
Greg,are you okay?
Greg,Memes as in the cultural ideas that pass from mind to mind as first proposed by Richard Dawkins are hereditary in a sense. If you parents possess the meme of religion you are more likely to receive this meme from then
Greg,Religion is not a meme
Greg,That's not what he means by meme
Greg,A meme is a unit of cultural evolution
Greg,Religion is something that has evolved over time with culture
Greg,Religion = scientific meme
Greg,Not funny meme
Greg,memes predate religion
Greg,The reason I ask is because I have noticed a quarelation between religious females and their attractiveness. Not to say there aren't attractive atheist.
Greg,I have actually noticed this too
Greg,what
Greg,"I might just have the ""I grew up in a Christian home"" bias"
Greg,saying you find religious ones more attractive?
Greg,^
Greg,Possibly
Greg,yeah
Greg,There appears to be a quarelation greater than .6 linking thicc and religiosity
Greg,are you sure its not just confirmation bias?
Greg,I'm not
Greg,"There has actually been research that conservatives are on average more attractive. So since most Christians are conservative, maybe that is the correlation."
Greg,I want to test it
Greg,Research must be done
Greg,For science
Greg,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Greg,Yes. Go upto attractive women and ask them if they are religious
Greg,Then ask for their number
Greg,I told you about that movie thing right
Greg,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Greg,No
Greg,
Greg,Tell us
Greg,oh well one of my buds from West was like hey do you want to go to a movie with me and some other people
Greg,like its only him and girls at first so he invited me
Greg,and I was like aight I hadn't hung out with him for a while so I went
Greg,he was like oh yeah so I'm pretty sure one of the girls likes me so i was basically the wingman
Greg,Yoda noises intensify
Greg,I was walking in to the movies with him and the girl that liked him and she asked if I thought one of her friends was cute and I didn't wanna be rude and be like nah
Greg,and I mean she kinda was
Greg,so I was like yeah I guess
Greg,and she was like oh well she thinks you're cute too
Greg,and its funny cause I knew this girl when I went to school with her and we hadn't really talked a whole lot but now that i don't go there anymore she thinks I'm cute? okay then
Greg,jed is only cute when you don't see him everyday
Greg,but basically the rest of the time was them trying to get us together but I wasn't really tryna mess around
Greg,also side note truth or dare is the worst movie of 2018
Greg,but I was a successful wingman 
Greg,"That feeling is called ""saudade"". It's a word only existant in portuguese, it is ""the wistful longing for something you no longer have""."
Greg,i think
Greg,dont quote me
Greg,lmao
Greg,I almost sent it though but I think the only reason I didn't is cause I asked a girl out earlier that day and the response was a maybe but leaning towards yes
Greg,so friday was a weird day for me
Greg,What the heck man
Greg,Jed gettin all kinds of ladies
Greg,Fellas is it gay to date a lady?
Greg,^
Greg,I mean you are literally going out with someone who sucks dick

Greg,@Rivals of Aether lets do a tournament sometime 
Greg,@Trapezoider check your snap
Greg,Can someone help me with a thing on transformations of graphs
Greg,
Greg,Like I don't get what they want
Greg,g(x)=-7f(x) or f(x)=-7g(x) I would think
Greg,My problems are usually not in terms of f(x) and g(x) so I'm not sure which one goes where
Greg,but reflecting a graph makes the function negative
Greg,and stretching by a factor of 7 means multiply by 7
Greg,Can you show the functions represented by f(x) and g(x)?
Greg,Just tryna figure out where to input that information
Greg,No they don't show me the graphs :(
Greg,Did my suggestion not work?
Greg,I'm going to bed now but good luck.
Greg,@Trapezoider whenever you get a chance to look at it I shared it with you so just put comments where you have them
Greg,You don't need to know what f(x) or g(x) are
Greg,I don't remember exactly how it works but I'm pretty sure you want something like g(x) = -f(1/7 x)
Greg,cause the negative gives you the vertical flip and the 1/7 x gives you the horizontal stretch
Greg,@Max
Greg,Yes they worked
Greg,boo in my high school we wouldn't have gotten marks for cheesing a horizontal stretch as a vertical one
Greg,My dad shutoff my fucking internet
Greg,riiiiip
Greg,Fuck that guy
Greg,I'm 17 and you tryna give me a bed time

Greg,doc are you gonna be back in frostbite now that exams are over?
Greg,I've been here all week 
Greg,I havent seen you 
Greg,I just wasn't in the mood for any csgo
Greg,

Greg,i miss you dad
Greg,"i got those airline tickets and ZACK
 is getting busfare soon"
Greg,*zack
Greg,fuck
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Nice
Greg,My parents would like to know if you buy tickets
Greg,I buy not tickets yet
Greg,Nice
Greg,lol
Greg,Did you even read what Max said @Trapezoider
Greg,I was mocking him
Greg,wait what did he say
Greg,Did he fix it
Greg,it doesnt say edited
Greg,Hello
Greg,If I say my message aloud it sounds perfectly fine
Greg,yeah
Greg,tense is a bit weird
Greg,My parents
Greg,"should be bought tickets, not buy tickets"
Greg,you can't read that and say that it was fine
Greg,Woud like to know
Greg,If you buy tickets
Greg,"but I know he has not yet, hence bought doesn't work"
Greg,no
Greg,because he hasnt yet
Greg,So they would like to know when he has
Greg,ok it could also be will buy
Greg,no it is do buy
Greg,using present tense doesn't work unless you're asking if that's what he is doing right now
Greg,or what he does in general
Greg,Holy fuck
Greg,Stop
Greg,"What do you for a living?
I buy tickets"
Greg,Yes
Greg,Have you bought tickets?
Greg,he was talking future tense
Greg,"""My parents would like to know if you buy tickets (some time in the future)"""
Greg,it makes sense
Greg,except that 'you buy' is present tense
Greg,its not
Greg,ok
Greg,what is the present tense of 'to buy' then
Greg,How about; if you are going to buy tickets
Greg,but that isn't what they want to know
Greg,yeah they want to know when(if) it happens
Greg,then you guys are just asking the wrong question
Greg,Then why would you use present tense?
Greg,"you should just ask ""are you going to buy tickets"""
Greg,that isn't the question either
Greg,no thats not it
Greg,literally don't even care
Greg,when are you going to buy tickets
Greg,he wanted to know when he buys tickets if he does
Greg,tell him after it happens
Greg,waezsxrdtcfvygubhnj
Greg,"then ask: are you going to buy tickets? if so, when? also, let us know when you do"
Greg,because the original question did not communicate that
Greg,thats over complicated
Greg,it's clear though
Greg,I UNDERSTOOD YOU GUYS ARE DUM B
Greg,THATS SOUNDS SO FORMAL
Greg,"Try it like this ""My parents would like to know if you die"""
Greg,same thing different words
Greg,The first question you asked did not communicate any of that information
Greg,it totally did
Greg,yeah but that's not how languages work because language is dumb
Greg,most verbs having to do with the state of a person have slightly different rules
Greg,I'm going to delete the message and leave this server if you guys don't shut up
Greg,it matters so little
Greg,omg
Greg,calm down
Greg,you understood what I meant
Greg,we didn't though
Greg,the end result would be that doctor would alert me if he purchased tickets
Greg,mission accomplished
Greg,*shrugs* 'spose
Greg,side question: am I alone in enjoying breaking down language and weird specifics of stuff? or is it just that I spent enough time having stuff beaten into my head while learning french that I've developed stockholm syndrome?
Greg,I find it to be very boring
Greg,It can be sometimes interesting
Greg,like in what just happened
Greg,I like comparing languages but being a grammar nazi isn't fun
Greg,I think it's neat

Greg,Pls
Greg,What does that even mean? @Trapezoider
Greg,Huh
Greg,Oh wow I actually wrote that
Greg,I thought that was part of the dream
Greg,Huh
Greg,Don't worry about it brother
Greg,haha what 
Greg,I had a dream I was messaging you guys in discord last night while trying to make an important life decision
Greg,Turns out I actually messaged you because I wasn't asleep yet :(
Greg,
Greg,I'm glad I fell asleep before the dream happened :) shit got real
Greg,This is so confusing
Greg,what was the decision?
Greg,Weather or not to do it to em boys
Greg,
Greg,How else would the dream had happened? Dreams only happen when you sleep.
Greg,That's untrue
Greg,Not if you're on drugs
Greg,I guess when you space out
Greg,Ever heard of daydreaming
Greg,but you're technically not asleep
Greg,...that's the point
Greg,"even if you daydream, you're not alseep, so you're not technically dreaming. You're actually deep in thought"
Greg,"yes, but your brain patterns 'n stuff are often closer to when you're falling asleep than when you're awake"
Greg,it's kind of an in-between state
Greg,take it from me who day dreams alot and has had some pretty messed up dreams in my life.
Greg,"BTW, while we're on the subject, have any of you guys tried to Lucid Dream?"
Greg,never actively tried but it happens every now and then
Greg,I am trying to master it so I can work during the night
Greg,I have. It's BEYOND trippy!
Greg,If I can lucid dream I can practice piano while I sleep etc
Greg,Even though I actually didn't try. My mind wouldn't settle down for some reason.
Greg,"Towards the end I actually got a little scared cause I was like, ""How do I wake up?!"""
Greg,Are you sure practicing piano in a dream would translate to real life??
Greg,Just form a cliff
Greg,Then jump off
Greg,weirdly it actually would
Greg,wild
Greg,cause you're training all the same bits of your brain that are holding the muscle memory
Greg,I think it would work
Greg,same patterns of brain activation
Greg,"I've heard if you die in a dream, there's a chance you could die in real life. Not know how true that is tho"
Greg,"probably not as well, but it could help"
Greg,also no that's 100% bullshit
Greg,thats not true
Greg,That's what I thought
Greg,well technically you could but it's the same chance as dying at any other point of your life
Greg,you're stupid
Greg,"Well maybe something could happen to your brain if you die in a dream, but that might not be true either."
Greg,You're brain doesn't function that way
Greg,It would have to produce a neurotransmitter which is toxic and produce it in high enough doses
Greg,"Well sorry, I'm not an expert on the brain functions!"
Greg,But the brain doesn't and wouldn't do that
Greg,wow neurotransmitter! That's a big word for you 
Greg,the placebo effect is strong but we're damn good at not tricking ourselves into dying
Greg,^^^
Greg,maybe it is for you but not for him
Greg,not everyone's retarded
Greg,"true... but I'm not, neither is he or you"
Greg,I don't know. None of us know you well enough to confirm or deny that. Except max and Ava 
Greg,that emoji makes me want to die

Greg,he picked me up cause apperently I beat a Kragg who is supposedly good
Greg,so I'm reading a javascript textbook
Greg,"""Every now and then, usually between eight and ten in the evening, Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail."""
Greg,what
Greg,"later on in the same chapter,

""For a few years, things go great for Jacques. But at some point he loses his job. Because he lives in a nasty country where having no job means having no medical services, he is forced to take employment with a circus where he performs as The Incredible Squirrelman, stuffing his mouth with peanut butter before every show.

One day, fed up with this pitiful existence, Jacques fails to change back into his human form, hops through a crack in the circus tent, and vanishes into the forest. He is never seen again."""
Greg,Why would this be in a java textbook?
Greg,Yeah what the hell
Greg,it was to set up the premise for data for a series of examples
Greg,"also, javascript, not java"
Greg,different languages
Greg,Would that make this any less weird?

Greg,wait why do you need to learn js reat dedux
Greg,redux
Greg,he wants me to make a website with it
Greg,and technically he's my boss
Greg,so that's what I'm doing
Greg,wait so you got an internship with your brother as your boss lol
Greg,yup
Greg,"nepotism, bitch"
Greg,wait so how are you planning to learn it react is pretty small but an not sure about redux
Greg,tons of massive ass tutorials
Greg,practice
Greg,what was that game
Greg,n0ne is a lunatic
Greg,that was way closer than it had any right to be
Greg,if he hadn't thrown away that ganon stock he could have won that
Greg,that recovery vs scorp tho
Greg,yeah that was unbelievable
Greg,was actually insane
Greg,I've never seen falcon recovery like that
Greg,imo n0ne is best at falcon recovery
Greg,god n0ne is the fucking best
Greg,wizzy is best at everything else
Greg,but sucks at recovery
Greg,s2j is just bad
Greg,s2j's ok at everything

Greg,@Jed
Greg,zack I asked her to go ice skating
Greg,This is the moment of truth Br0THER
Greg,did you ask her over text
Greg,I asked her on our run this morning when  she came over
Greg,and she said
Greg,She would consult other tentative plans. And would provide and answer around this time. Lookin like a fat no
Greg,"also, you guys have indoor rinks? didn't occur to me that the states would have that"
Greg,Hell yeah. There are like 2 nearby ish
Greg,r
Greg,i
Greg,p
Greg,F
Greg,F
Greg,"@Trapezoider  most likely if she said she'd concult plans it means she's not interested. (Or maybe she is, but most likely not...)"
Greg,or maybe she just doesn't like skating
Greg,we gotta stay optimistic
Greg,I'm with Zack
Greg,I guess...
Greg,I feel like skating isn't all that popular in the states
Greg,I tried ice skating this one time and I sucked at it.
Greg,fell on my butt like 20 times
Greg,yeah that's skating at first
Greg,still easier than snowboarding
Greg,first time I tried I spent more time on the ground than on my feet
Greg,but in general skating ignores a lot of the things you instinctively do to stay balanced
Greg,cause you can't brace yourself except sideways
Greg,that was the same with me. The only time I was actually standing was when I was hugging the wall.
Greg,skating takes time
Greg,only reason I'm any good is cause canada
Greg,lots of practice
Greg,Though I'd much rather roll skate than ice skate.
Greg,shudders
Greg,I don't like how hard it is to stop on roller skates
Greg,"stopping on roller skates is tough, but you can at least STAND on them."
Greg,it's a skill on skates -_-
Greg,its something you have to learn
Greg,but at least I know that if I'm out of control I can stop quickly

Greg,"Calvin Harris - Feels feat. Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry & Big Sean Taken from the new album 'Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1'. Out Now: http://smarturl.it/FWBV1?IQ..."
Greg,"partially built on the fact that, as a socially inept introvert, it's rare that I meet people where I can spend an evening just chilling without doing any specific activity and not feel drained or like we ran out of stuff to talk about and stuff got awkward"
Greg,and it was just a good chill happy time

Greg,
Greg,dude wtf you guys doing lol
Greg,I just watched the end of the last mafia and chillin threw so hard
Greg,he had it in the bag
Greg,and he fucked up right at the end
Greg,"also this is getting me to want to try some mafia, who'd be down to play?"
Greg,me
Greg,As am I
Greg,how many people do we need to get a proper game going?
Greg,I think somewhere in the realm of 12-14
Greg,"google says you need at least 7, 2 mafia vs 5 town"
Greg,today won't work for me though because I have 3 finals tomorrow
Greg,I think 2 vs 5 is for speed mafia without the medic cop and vigilante
Greg,I can't for the next 12 days
Greg,I mean I think you need some town roles
Greg,I feel like doing 2 mafia 4 town 1 cop would be best
Greg,Yo what about the doctor tho
Greg,eh less important imo
Greg,Let's do it when Chris gets back
Greg,Astralis got 3-0'd last night :(

Greg,theoretically
Greg,zain could win this
Greg,he's beaten m2k
Greg,and if leffen makes it through he could
Greg,personally I'm hoping for m2k leffen grands
Greg,I don't think Zain has ever beaten m2k
Greg,didn't he in pools? or was that 3-2 m2k
Greg,m2k won 3-2
Greg,and he won every game in the marth ditto and 3-0ed him in a marth ditto a few tourneys ago
Greg,ah that's probably gonna be m2k's win then

Greg,Submitted
Greg,Should have been anonymous though
Greg,the name was optional
Greg,so it can be anonymous if you want
Greg,I have reason to believe someone is spamming multiple responses
Greg,Please don't ruin my poll

Greg,"I may remake it later, require authentication, and only PM it to master memers"
Greg,just delete the spam results
Greg,I'm not sure if they are spam though
Greg,someone may have just used a dumb name and responded almost exactly like another person
Greg,can we access poll results soon?

Greg,possibly not tonight

Greg,I think the best absa

Greg,WOOOOO
Greg,@Max
Greg,lets play skullgirls
Greg,alright
Greg,let me go get my controller cable and refil my coffee
Greg,5 mins
Greg,andrew did you lean any combos?
Greg,"if not, max should probably play not his main"
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,buy your texas tickets big gay
Greg,!zack
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,how do you break out of combos
Greg,This game is hard
Greg,@everyone
Greg,Let's have a skill girls tournament on Saturday
Greg,I mean you don't break out of combos
Greg,but if you see this weird smoke stuff you can hit any button to burst
Greg,but htat only happens if the other person repeats the same thing too many times in the same combo
Greg,"and if me or max is comboing you, we've learned combos that don't let you break out"
Greg,
Greg,"but generally, it's not optimal to do the full combo unless it's gonna kill"
Greg,cause the longer the combo the less any individual hit does
Greg,"you ideally want to combo someone a bit, then trick them and start a new combo with fresh damage scaling"
Greg,but neither me nor max is good enough to do that yet
Greg,"also, max, did you go fukua against him? that wasn't very nice of you lol"
Greg,I only remember half the combo
Greg,I know next to nothing about any other character and didn't feel like figuring it out
Greg,@Trapezoider I'll be down for games in like an hour and a half
Greg,Hell yeah
Greg,Going to the gym will play games when I return

Greg,"Like a salmon, I have returned to the land of my birth"
Greg,"hopefully, unlike a salmon, I will be neither dying nor mating here"
Greg,"also, the nearest in & out is an hour and a half walk away and I'm salty"
Greg,I might do it anyway
Greg,Welcome to America!
Greg,guys your roads are so nice
Greg,True
Greg,"If you come to the meetup you can see the widest highway in the entire world. The Katy Freeway, which is something like 16 lanes."
Greg,Depends where tho
Greg,"I mean it's more just like, they're hella smooth"
Greg,cause there aren't proper winters here
Greg,so you don't get tons of potholes
Greg,I'm not used to this
Greg,Warm climate>cold climate
Greg,"on the flip side, it's about a million degrees in my room"
Greg,and there's no AC
Greg,lemme add 'fan' to my shopping list
Greg,good idea
Greg,"once I unpacked my computer, the first thing I looked up was the nearest in and out, and the second thing was making sure the tap water is drinkable"
Greg,"priorities, motherfuckers"
Greg,"tap water: safe to drink
tap water: tastes kinda bad"
Greg,"also, your paper money sucks"
Greg,Yes

Greg,my next best option is kfc
Greg,Its decent
Greg,is kfc a better bet?
Greg,they're both meh imo
Greg,but which one is more meh
Greg,I think it depends on if you want burger or chicken
Greg,choose based on that
Greg,I mean I don't really care one way or the other?
Greg,dammit I'm trying to get you guys to make up my mind
Greg,choose jack in the box
Greg,
Greg,AAAAAAH I JUST CHECK MY INTERNET
Greg,178 mb/s down
Greg,hot damn

Greg,"was gonna do jack in the box, but I accidentally turned right instead of left and ended up at kfc"
Greg,and decided it was probably fate
Greg,and now I can feel like I've lived the american dream
Greg,of getting shitty service in a basically empty kfc

Greg,My history teacher is retarded and we have to color and label a map of every country
Greg,Every country in the entire world?
Greg,This has nothing to do with history
Greg,Yes all 206 or whatever
Greg,wow
Greg,He is just a horrible teacher who doesn't want to teach or grade anything
Greg,At least you didn't have to put a certain number of dots on each country based off it's population
Greg,That was fun
Greg,Damn
Greg,Oh Christ
Greg,Why is the education system so retarded
Greg,Nah it's just this teacher really
Greg,But I mean yeah
Greg,He doesn't even give tests it's always projects
Greg,Because we don't learn anything
Greg,good ol education system
Greg,But I go to a private school so one would expect that it'd be better but no
Greg,lol
Greg,My history teacher at the public school was a million times better

Greg,My education at a community college is 10x better than 5000 a year private school lol

Greg,@Homies do you guys wanna have a melee tournament where Zack and max can't play their mains or secondaries?
Greg,I'm down
Greg,I guess so
Greg,"Honestly, depending on skill level, you may need to ban 15+ characters"
Greg,for us
Greg,we could do it like we used to do rivals tournaments
Greg,we should do it like rivals where each person gets a certain number of bans
Greg,based on skill
Greg,great minds think alike
Greg,^
Greg,maybe I could even rope in Ava for one more
Greg,lets try and do it tonight
Greg,so do we have 4 so far?
Greg,we could maybe get up to 6
Greg,I'm curious what my ping's gonna be like to everyone
Greg,I think we'll have to except that some people will have awful ping
Greg,I'll have great ping to andrew for once
Greg,I have fine ping to the shapes so we should be okay
Greg,and jed
Greg,"also, do you want to play a bit in like an hour? I want to get a little more done but then I want a break"
Greg,I'm down
Greg,just @ me
Greg,will do
Greg,I think we can get 6 for sure
Greg,"Kameron

Greg,@cs 1 game ?
Greg,@Zain  ?>
Greg,@Max is thing happen tonight?
Greg,no
Greg,Jed isn't here
Greg,"@Sak von Sak  Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you been watching the Persona 5 Animation? If you are, how are you enjoying it?"
Greg,it's.... mediocre
Greg,it gets the broad strokes
Greg,but the pacing's wack
Greg,really?
Greg,and it's skipped a lot of little important character moments
Greg,it's missing a lot of the charm the game had
Greg,"Well I mean, trying to crame moments into a 30 minute episode and 24 of them, I can see how the pacing can be off."
Greg,"I only saw one episode, the battle against Kamoshida (the first boss)."
Greg,I mean it's not horrible
Greg,but you'd be better off playing the game
Greg,my biggest problem is they keep cutting good character building moments
Greg,and it's persona
Greg,you can't just skip the character building
Greg,and the back-and-forth and stuff that builds the characters into a group with dynamics and stuff rather than just a bunch of characters shoved together
Greg,"also the protag is both a) bland as fuck, and b) practically non-existant as a character"
Greg,"I know they're running him from a silent protagonist in the game, but even in-game they gave him a lot more character than this"
Greg,"like, watch the p4 anime if you want to see a persona protag handled well"
Greg,"or even the p3 movies, although he's kind of an emo little shit, but at least that's actually a personality"
Greg,sorry

Greg,Also more for what
Greg,Meetup
Greg,
Greg,Hey it's like frostbites 3 years anniversary
Greg,Ah
Greg,how do you know
Greg,Because I met you guys for the tf2 team 3 years ago
Greg,frostbite is a bit older than you knowing them is
Greg,frostbite was actually a bit later
Greg,but the core group was earlier
Greg,I wasn't even part of the original core group
Greg,the original team where we all met was called frostbite
Greg,thats where the name came from
Greg,I joined like... two and a half years ago?
Greg,oh huh
Greg,"so it was frostbite, then not frostbite, then frostbite again?"
Greg,yes
Greg,Frostbite>Pancake Pals>POOP>Rolo Regiment>Frostbite
Greg,I've known you guys for 3 years is what I was saying
Greg,It's my anniversary of knowing you guys
Greg,POOP?
Greg,POOP
Greg,is that an acronym?
Greg,People Order Our Patties
Greg,o h
Greg,I voted against it
Greg,its funny
Greg,that team was made of spongebob references
Greg,Man we've had a lot of good times
Greg,RIP frostbite gamers
Greg,"unrelated, but I had a dream last night that my friend (in the dream, now that I'm awake I have no idea who he was) got turned into a giant monster cause he fell into a pool of red bull and the army was after him so me and some other people took him and ran away to australia where we just kinda chilled in a hotel room and threw cookies at each other"
Greg,"also unrelated, to both the previous conversation and my previous thing, I found the best twitter: it's a bot that scrapes github for people committing stuff with swearing in it and posts them. It scratches two great itches of 1) relating to salty programmers, and 2) hilarious mixing of professional, technical writing with swearing"
Greg,for example: https://twitter.com/gitlost/status/996784597194170369
Greg,I MADE THIS SHIT TO WORK ASYNCHRONOUSLY WITH SMALL DELAYS
Greg,Make a film off of that dream please

Greg,The first frostbite discord post
Greg,Actually I feel like that's wrong my discord might be lying to me
Greg,Holy crap
Greg,My guy how long did you scroll
Greg,Lol
Greg,Remember when we used mumble
Greg,Doctors mumble server
Greg,No it was kamerons
Greg,:0
Greg,Cause it was mumble tf2
Greg,my first tf2 team still has a facebook page and it's mad nostalgic
Greg,
Greg,am just an overwatch scrub lol
Greg,I'm scrolling back through now and I found the best picture I've ever taken
Greg,Yo everyone keep sending old screenshots on getting so much nostalgia
Greg,
Greg,This is the beginning of my server
Greg,what about the OG frostbite?
Greg,I left that server :0
Greg,Why
Greg,@Bitmin
Greg,esea
Greg,im only back now and a bit later
Greg,That was a good nostalgia trip
Greg,^
Greg,Man I remember mumble
Greg,I honestly dont really remember mumble
Greg,discord is so much better
Greg,I remember I hated discord whnr it came out
Greg,Mumbles interface was terrible
Greg,Discord is a huge step up
Greg,I don't know how we used it for so long
Greg,"If we've known Trap for 3 years, does that mean we've known each other for 4? @Max @Mr. Airplane"
Greg,"no, its been 3 years for us"
Greg,around 2 and a half for him
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,September 25 is the earliest thing I can find in Monday night super slammed whatever
Greg,Of 2015
Greg,Kameron Chris and I were on a team before that
Greg,it formed in May 2015
Greg,^
Greg,
Greg,I joined early 2016 if I remember correctly
Greg,Chikon nd the cock fighters right
Greg,Or rolo regiment
Greg,Right?
Greg,rolo regiment
Greg,not even the weirdest team name I've played for
Greg,that probably goes to 'It's Raining Minh'
Greg,HA
Greg,Was the leader Chinese?
Greg,not even
Greg,the story goes a little like this:
Greg,"there was a team, with some normal name"
Greg,their medic was this guy who went by minh
Greg,and they had some weird in-joke about 'minh advantage'
Greg,"eventually, said team disbanded, and a few people got together to make a new team, which was called minh advantage"
Greg,"that team also broke up, and a new subset of that team, containing a few people from the original team whose name I don't remember, made another new team, minh advantage II"
Greg,which is when I joined
Greg,"then there was some upheaval with a patch that messed with demo and heavy a bit and like, half the team quit"
Greg,"it was then patched up with some teammates from my first tf2 team and some tryouts, and rechristened It's Raining Minh"
Greg,and we went on to make playoffs
Greg,and then disband
Greg,You should make a movie out of that
Greg,I'm now wondering if some people from it's raining minh went on to make another team with a name containing minh
Greg,"also, as It's Raining Minh our team tag was a little umbrella that is for some reason an accepted unicode character"
Greg,@Melee anyone want to play for a bit?
Greg,yes
Greg,I can't talk tho
Greg,k
Greg,@Melee I am unsatiated
Greg,why?
Greg,cause kameron has to go

Greg,"@Sak von Sak  I got a Persona 5 question, since you're the wizard at this stuff. Someone I watch on Youtube was describing anime characters in 4 seconds and someone gave him Morgana and he said ""IT'S TIME TO GO TO FREAKIN' SLEEP!"" how does that describe Morgana?"
Greg,@Bitmin wanna csgo?
Greg,Oh jeez I have not slept in a couple day but I'll play 1 game give me a couple mins
Greg,oh ok
Greg,pfffft yeah
Greg,it's a meme
Greg,that you probably won't experience in the show
Greg,"but basically at the end of days in-game, sometimes based on events during the day you can't go out or anything, but the game still gives you some control over your character"
Greg,but if you try to leave
Greg,Morgana: You look tired. You should get some sleep.
Greg,it's an integral part of the p5 experience
Greg,
Greg,"had to vanish to catch an uber, but to finish, it's become such a prominant thing that the company that made the game is selling shirts of it

Greg,@Weeb
Greg,so my hero academia is a good show
Greg,nice
Greg,"I won't deny that, it's just personally doesn't appeal to me."
Greg,yee that show's awesome
Greg,how far in are you?
Greg,4 episodes
Greg,I watched it this morning
Greg,I may be sleep deprived but I teared up a little bit 
Greg,I think I'm gay 
Greg,Crying as a man doesn't mean you're gay
Greg,but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
Greg,
Greg,who said I'm gay?
Greg,literally nobody
Greg,^ we were talking about me
Greg,"well when he said
but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
after my comment, I thought he was talking about me"
Greg,Nah he's saying I'm gay
Greg,
Greg,"well like I said, crying as a man doesn't mean your gay."
Greg,you are of hte gay andrew
Greg,Snap
Greg,I thought I liked girls
Greg,"In fact, it shows that you're a true man as true men know how to express their feelings"
Greg,^^^ true brother
Greg,"and besides, you're not gay in my book unless you're making out with dudes."
Greg,bruh i feel like you can still make out with dudes and not be gay
Greg,aslong as your socks are on
Greg,"if you were forced, maybe."
Greg,"like if my LIFE or something VERY precious to me was on the line, I'd probably do it. But otherwise, nuh uh!"
Greg,Compelled homosexuality
Greg,like if some dude came up to me  and offered me $20 to make out with him id probably do it so i see where you're coming from mrd256
Greg,"I wouldn't do it for $20, unless I was desperate."
Greg,i am
Greg,you're broke then
Greg,College
Greg,"eh, makes sense"
Greg,"I could get two extra large pepperoni pizzas for $20

I would give a guy a quick peck on the lips for two extra large pepperoni pizzas, especially in this situation where there's clearly no expectations of anything beyond that. I'm not desperate or broke, I just really like pizza."
Greg,with $20 i can buy literally 60 packs of ramen
Greg,thats lunch for 2 months
Greg,ramen in America is unhealthy you now that.
Greg,"like, extremely"
Greg,clearly you don't understand university living
Greg,it's far more healthy to eat ramen every day for lunch
Greg,than to not eat lunch
Greg,^
Greg,fucking
Greg,preach
Greg,"Well I'm not in collage or live by my self yet, so maybe it don't."
Greg,but the pizzas though
Greg,"And while ramen is not good for you, it is better than not eating anything. Doesn't make it healthier tho"
Greg,at the end of the day I think it comes down to priorities: there's not much on that level of harmlessness that I wouldn't do for $20
Greg,"Listen, $20 is $20"
Greg,^
Greg,@Cs:go gamezzzzzzzz
Greg,Ya boi sold his car
Greg,Firebird incoming
Greg,Prolly
Greg,proud of you dad

Greg,not even my fault. 2 tonne car with no handling thats 25 years old
Greg,
Greg,Well the Firebirds are also 20+ years old
Greg,"but are high performance sports cars designed for optimal control and speed balance. Im so excited for you though, youre going to be boolin   and impressin all kinds of ladies"

Greg,"@Zack  So I was playing Persona 5 and I think I noticed an animation error in one of the cutscenes. This is the beach scene. Yusuke holds up his hands like he's trying to picture something in the next shot his hands are like backwards? Thought you might find this interesting.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449728861484220416/unknown.png
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449729119408619551/unknown.png"
Greg,lol I never noticed that
Greg,probably just a laziness thing
Greg,I was probably a little too busy cracking up at the towel thing
Greg,"It's just something funny that caught my eye.
Yeah, the towel thing was funny too."
Greg,"Tho one of the highlights for me in this scene, was the protagonist actually speaking an actual line. Just based on his battle quotes, I think they choose a great english VA for him, but he doesn't speak enough, even during battle."
Greg,"If there is a Persona 5 animation dub, I'd watch it just to hear his VA in full."
Greg,Xander Mobus
Greg,he's the announcer guy for sm4sh
Greg,and they picked him for basically just yelling names again
Greg,good pick
Greg,honestly the english cast for p5 is all damn good except maybe haru
Greg,"yeah, I think his voice fits him."
Greg,Haru... eh she's okay.
Greg,her voice was annoying at first but it grew on me
Greg,that's kinda the way it is will all really high-pitched girls
Greg,eh not always
Greg,but yeah pretty often
Greg,"Honestly, I wasn't too big a fan of Makoto's VA. Not that she was a bad actress, but the fact that her voice didn't really suit her. But that's me"
Greg,I am incredibly biased towards her voice actress because she's done a ton of roles I've loved
Greg,so I felt like it worked
Greg,but that might just be me
Greg,But the one VA I like out of them all is Morgana's. Cassandra Morris is one of my most favorite dub voice actresses
Greg,She had me terrified
Greg,you can't put kyubey's voice in a cutesy animal sidekick
Greg,you just can't do that
Greg,that's not ok
Greg,"Well, I don't really know who Kyubey is... but I like her because of some other roles she's done."
Greg,"And Morgana is not a ""Cutesy"" animal sidekick!"
Greg,"@ anyone who's watched madoka magica, confirm that you would be scared to hear his voice coming out of any cutesy animal sidekick"
Greg,"also, aesthetically, definitely cutesy"
Greg,"personality-wise, not as much"
Greg,I'll give you that
Greg,"also, you've finished p4, right?"
Greg,"I didn't play it, but I've watched the anime. But I did finish the anime"
Greg,"for p4, I correctly predicted the villain by their voice actor, cause I was like 'there is no way they would hire a voice actor this good at sounding badass and evil and give him to that derpy a character.'"
Greg,so I was never not suspicious of morgana
Greg,I'm not telling you if I was right or not
Greg,but I was scared from start to finish
Greg,"Most of the roles I know Morgana's VA from are all protagonist characters or sub characters. Nothing evil about them. Also, she was in p4's anime"
Greg,p4 had the weirdest voice cast
Greg,@Mr. Airplane show us your graduation pics or it's fake
Greg,"50% amazing, 50% terrible"
Greg,"Yeah, the only VAs I liked in p4 were Yu, Yosuke, Kanji, and Rise"
Greg,that would pretty much be their big-name voice actors in the main cast
Greg,yep
Greg,"Johnny Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker/Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey"
Greg,and then a bunch of mediocre people
Greg,and then some big names for tiny roles
Greg,that pretty much sums it up
Greg,"p5 has the best overall cast, p3 had a solid one with a few big problems"
Greg,it starts off so strong
Greg,"Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Vic Mignogna, Tara Platt, Liam O'Brian"
Greg,and then Fuuka shows up
Greg,heh
Greg,I didn't know Michelle Ruff and Liam O'Brian were in p3. Did Michelle voice Yukari?
Greg,"yeah, and Liam O'Brian did Akihiko"
Greg,Ah! I was thinking Akihiko was Josh Grelle.
Greg,"and Yukari is possibly my favorite Persona girl so far.
and my favorite Persona character period is possibly Akechi from p5"
Greg,"I Really like that sadistic and psychotic type of villian, especially where they look so innocent to begin with."
Greg,I always kinda figured he was gonna turn out evil
Greg,I just didn't realize... how evil
Greg,when he snaps he snaps
Greg,and his voice actor does an amazing job of it too
Greg,"He was like one of the main antagonists, next to Shido and the final boss"
Greg,yeah he does
Greg,and he was definitely the most interesting antagonist
Greg,true that

Greg,especially when their rooms contain the only bathrooms

Greg,Sorry about to play a game of civ 5
Greg,training session?
Greg,DO YOU MEAN
Greg,MELEE
Greg,ill play
Greg,melee isnt fun with such high ping because high ping buffs you as a player and nerfs me. I will fight you when I am in texas and our ping is better
Greg,honestly high ping usually hurts the stronger player
Greg,"you can't combo as hard, or be as precise in neutral"
Greg,"no johns, andrew"
Greg,@Trapezoider Civ game isn't happening I can play now
Greg,youre wrong in this case zack
Greg,Kameron has no movement ability and little tech skill
Greg,he still has combos and neutral
Greg,My playstyle revolves around getting grabs and spacing around my opponent
Greg,which are far more affected
Greg,When I have 120 ping
Greg,"@Sak von Sak When your entire punish game is being good at tech chasing, high ping hurts a lot"
Greg,wavedashing because impossible
Greg,I guess
Greg,which is the case for trap
Greg,"also wavedashing and most tech is muscle memory, ping shouldn't matter"
Greg,It does matter because it changes the timing
Greg,Milliseconds matter
Greg,"a wavedash is the same input, you just have to do it ever so slightly earlier"
Greg,no different than any other input

Greg,It would be awesome if we could get that many teams
Greg,50 50 split would be more fun imo
Greg,nah
Greg,We shall vote
Greg,then it would all end in 1 fight
Greg,good point
Greg,"with smaller teams, the fights will be more spread out"
Greg,but if someone dies super early thats so lame
Greg,and 2v1 comebacks are much more possible than like 2v6
Greg,They can spectate
Greg,pvp gives me depression
Greg,that's sometimes almost as fun as playing
Greg,no it aint
Greg,We will be having a grace period
Greg,everyone will be safe for some amount of time
Greg,trap team with me pls
Greg,@Trapezoider
Greg,@Trapezoider I'll need to go over some standard rules to prevent stalling before we play
Greg,ye youre my team
Greg,aavaaa
Greg,Max make the rules and put them in the Realm channel
Greg,someone stop letting max make the rules
Greg,no mining?
Greg,tf?
Greg,These are standard rules
Greg,without them it is impossible to find anyone
Greg,no Branch minding Devin!
Greg,All major UHC games follow that rule
Greg,wow you're supposed to be my main man matt but you dont even know how to spell my name
Greg,"first of all, I'm not your bud.
second, is it Kevin or Devin? you keep changing it"
Greg,first of all
Greg,i am your bud
Greg,second of all
Greg,kevin is my persona my irl name has always been Devon
Greg,no one likes u kevn
Greg,
Greg,"@Max  I say Nether should be allowed, but only for Blaze Rods."
Greg,also... I'm not sure about enchanting
Greg,The point of banning the nether is so you can't hide in it
Greg,agree no nether
Greg,hmm that's a good point.
Greg,I would like no enchanting
Greg,"Also, is this team based or no?"
Greg,@Trapezoider hey fucker
Greg,"The reason for the nether, diamond, and enchantment bans is to try and speed up the game by vastly reducing the amount of time people need to spend gathering resources."
Greg,"Not sure if everyone wants this, but I think it would be more fun."
Greg,is this team based or no?
Greg,We are planning on having teams
Greg,ok
Greg,I say we have a grace period until the end of the first Minecraft day
Greg,day or day and night?
Greg,from sunrise Day 1 to sunrise day 2
Greg,day and night
Greg,I mean we could always just go off of the honour system to not hide
Greg,there are some people on here I don't trust to do that
Greg,Also we could say that after x amount of time we get teleported to spawn to finish so it doesn't last forever
Greg,"Even with no hiding, by banning these things we will reduce the amount of time needed to acquire maximum strength gear"
Greg,I trust everyone here
Greg,points to Devin
Greg,"That is my main reason, not to prevent hiding."
Greg,@Jed
Greg,why did you hey fucker
Greg,Whats up
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,can you take a break to join for the realms thing big guy?
Greg,in like an hour
Greg,I don't think he owns Minecraft
Greg,really? I thought he was there last time we made a realm
Greg,"I mean, I don't think banning things like diamonds and the nether are gonna be fun. I think you should be able to use whatever you find"
Greg,at least allow diamonds
Greg,We can discuss this in detail when we decide the final rules later.
Greg,but then ppl will spend forever looking for them and thats boring
Greg,^^^^
Greg,"also, if we're doing custom terrain, we can lower diamond spawn rates making it harder to get them"
Greg,That would lead to even more time farming though
Greg,Not if you can't strip mine. People will have to leave their caves eventually
Greg,
Greg,I'm not for lowering the rates of ores
Greg,Kinda lame
Greg,only diamond
Greg,just diamonds
Greg,Still
Greg,If anything make them more common
Greg,Lowering diamonds makes others more common?
Greg,"No, I mean make diamonds more common so you don't have to spend as long searching for them."
Greg,but then everyone will have diamond gear
Greg,so?
Greg,well I guess that's fair kinda fair...
Greg,makes fights last longer
Greg,true
Greg,yeah
Greg,We could also give everyone 20 hearts with commands
Greg,You guys want that?
Greg,I like that
Greg,ye
Greg,Keep figuring this out and tell me what to do when we start
Greg,Are we gonna have a world border?
Greg,of course
Greg,Can we do a shrinking border then?
Greg,are we playing on the latest snap shot or 1.12?
Greg,"@Trapezoider If you want this to go more smoothly, be sure to make me an OP on your new server"
Greg,"can we make a rule that if someone dies randomly from falling they can come back to life, I feel like that is going to happen and it will be super lame"
Greg,No
Greg,That won't happen
Greg,no
Greg,it might
Greg,Just don't die from fall damage
Greg,Easy
Greg,yeah
Greg,^
Greg,its no t
Greg,just watch what you're doing at all times
Greg,>.>
Greg,I'm planning on having health regen on by the way
Greg,Survival of the fittest mother fucker
Greg,Having it off penalizes you for taking fights
Greg,so are we playing in the latest snapshot or 1.12?
Greg,I would say 1.12
Greg,"well hold on, I want to check if 1.13 is out, I don't think it is... but I want to check"
Greg,it is on pre-release
Greg,will that do? or still on 1.12?
Greg,@Max
Greg,Whatever the realm allows for
Greg,what time are we starting?
Greg,After the Sony E3 event
Greg,not sure when that is
Greg,ask Andrew
Greg,I'm just going to be here
Greg,@Trapezoider  what time is Sony E3 over?
Greg,idk
Greg,im not watching it
Greg,Can you declare a start time then? Otherwise it will be left ambiguous and it will never happen.
Greg,Sony ends at 10 ish
Greg,What time zone?
Greg,est
Greg,Est
Greg,so in about an hour
Greg,Yeah

Greg,finally
Greg,"@ me when we're starting, otherwise I won't see it"

Greg,i sudokued
Greg,On purpose
Greg,"Kameron pulled a hunger games move, except he wasn't one of the last two people alive"
Greg,yeah
Greg,whats the zombie swarm mechanic?
Greg,Hitting zombies spawns more zombies
Greg,More smash 5 on stream
Greg,That are aggro on you
Greg,smash 5 stylistically looks much more developed than 4
Greg,I agree
Greg,The game looks good
Greg,it looks visually complete
Greg,this game suz
Greg,Let's hope it feels good
Greg,worse than maxs retard fort
Greg,smash 4 just was missing some stuff visually
Greg,so is this game
Greg,:/
Greg,Andrew how does this game look bad?
Greg,It looks worse than jeds beard
Greg,H
Greg,O
Greg,W
Greg,F
Greg,Also I was part of the retard fort too
Greg,yea
Greg,Don't just throw Max under the bus
Greg,Thanks buddy
Greg,I gotchu
Greg,Who ever is playing pac man right now sucks real bad
Greg,Yo what are the command seals in fate zero
Greg,im confused
Greg,They allow you to give your servant a command that they cannot refuse regardless of how they personally feel about the order
Greg,HOw many times can you USE them
Greg,3
Greg,Ohhhh
Greg,Why are they using items on this stream
Greg,cause it's the casual stream
Greg,yo the tipper caused the slowmo

Greg,Feelsbad
Greg,f
Greg,he said the devs are still making changes
Greg,Maybe there is hope
Greg,Feedback from melee players will hopefully help
Greg,well I've lost all interest in this game
Greg,knockback looks so wack
Greg,you fly super far super fast and then just stop
Greg,that's gonna mess with combos pretty hard I'm guessing
Greg,"no ledge hog, no wave stuff, same top tier as smash 4, no  dash dance, resident sleeper"
Greg,fingers crossed for it improving in the interm
Greg,cause they'll probably get a lot of feedback from the competitive people who want some changes
Greg,yes and nintendo will TOTALLY listen to that /s
Greg,shhh let me live in my happy little bubble
Greg,ok sorry
Greg,this is pretty cringe
Greg,I use that word sparingly
Greg,"desk guy: ""everyone's hoping for that 7th map""
the entire chat: ""4-0 pls"""
Greg,"If the numbers each character was given in the smash 5 trailer corresponds to the order they were created (which I think they said was the case), then the long held theory of roy and game and watch being created last and being incomplete has finally been confirmed."
Greg,2-2 rip
Greg,resident sleeper
Greg,I'm reading reddit and people seem to think that ledge hogging in a game is bad and I honestly don't understand why
Greg,it literally doubles the amount of ways that you can feasibly kill your opponent and thus makes the game more interesting and complex
Greg,what's even the point of ledges if they don't do anything?
Greg,it begins

Greg,Where is it at

Greg,Nintendo @ E3: Day 1
Greg,lol already we've got mango chants
Greg,crowd chanting mango
Greg,mango chant
Greg,lol
Greg,we all thought the same thing
Greg,were they not allowed to wear their team's jerseys?
Greg,prolly not cause it's pure nintendo sponsored
Greg,also why is vish's mic so quiet
Greg,Vish's mic is broken I think
Greg,I think we are hearing auditorium speaker audio through the other people's mics
Greg,This better be 1v1s
Greg,why wouldnt it be?
Greg,oh well nevermind
Greg,The smash 4 invitational was 4 player ffa
Greg,this is actually a pretty neat format
Greg,zero armada is probably a busted team tho
Greg,not really
Greg,They have the smash ball on
Greg,I mean the bracket format
Greg,^
Greg,of dubs -> singles
Greg,cringey announcer
Greg,funnyskit tho
Greg,I figured armada would pick pokemon trainer because he really likes ivysaur
Greg,cheering for zero armada
Greg,you can act out of airdodge
Greg,it's got some lag tho
Greg,that map was wack
Greg,oh they play one map
Greg,lol 2nd at evo 2017... someone's got their info wrong
Greg,"2015, yes, 2017 no"
Greg,unlucky
Greg,bayo looks more reasonable now
Greg,he stuff's got more knockback
Greg,you know the slowmo prolly makes it really easy to di
Greg,but you still CAN do the old combos but it's way harder
Greg,hopefully you can turn slowmo off
Greg,"also, while there's no lcancelling it looks like you've got way less landing lag on stuff"
Greg,I might main bayo
Greg,its a consideration
Greg,They haven't even shown how each character plays yet
Greg,My list of potential mains is rather long
Greg,Just because they were good in smash 4 doesn't really mean they will continue to be good with all these new characters
Greg,True beans
Greg,there are only 2 new characters
Greg,Still more characters than smash 4
Greg,Things can change
Greg,They only have access to 30 characters right now
Greg,hbox v reggie again
Greg,LETS GET SOME 1V1
Greg,Random cosplayers?
Greg,wutface
Greg,Obese Ness lol
Greg,they're all fat]
Greg,Wtf
Greg,Ness is sweatin'
Greg,Lucky thought that game was a ffa match LOLOLOL
Greg,He was attacking Mr. R on purpose
Greg,derp
Greg,wat
Greg,the legend
Greg,Lol
Greg,zero's prolly got this in the bag
Greg,Where's the Charizard
Greg,pokemon trainer looks kinda neat tho
Greg,I think if you work out the changes mid-combo 'n stuff you've got some tricks
Greg,This doesn't look that good
Greg,armada didn't really do anything with it tho
Greg,also ike looks sick
Greg,he's so fast
Greg,F MangO
Greg,mewtwo's sooo fast
Greg,hot damn
Greg,that was actually pretty good
Greg,and they were using wavelands and stuff
Greg,My man plup
Greg,I have faith in this game being good
Greg,is this genesis?
Greg,Items 
Greg,I mean yeah the items were a bit weird
Greg,THAT AINT ZELDA
Greg,but the standard play was legit
Greg,It looked real nice
Greg,I want to see the finals
Greg,Snake vs Sheik
Greg,sure the combos aren't stellar but it looks like it's got setups and such that you didn't have as much in sm4sh
Greg,hopefully no items
Greg,that was actually pretty hype at the end
Greg,like you've got post-combo positioning setups that look real good
Greg,WHY
Greg,this is so pointless
Greg,shhh
Greg,it's pandering to hte casuals
Greg,"Pointless, unless they bring out actual people"
Greg,who are these people??
Greg,Who are these people?
Greg,Who TF???
Greg,I mean there was an ign person
Greg,but I dunno
Greg,these are pretty meh vips
Greg,just give me reggie vs hbox
Greg,^
Greg,Tfw they play DK crew song when a big black guy comes on stage 
Greg,i know blacknerdcomedy has a youtube
Greg,which is quite popular
Greg,well  its already over
Greg,that kyogre sweep lol
Greg,I think Zelda and Sheik are the same character again
Greg,they said no
Greg,they showed up as different characters in the initial intro
Greg,The girl's name is Zelda
Greg,Not the character
Greg,I see
Greg,"remeber kids, Animal Crossing teaches you that Taxation is theft"
Greg,sheik looks really fun
Greg,COMBOS
Greg,OMG
Greg,yo that was nutty
Greg,Sheik looks really fun
Greg,That was insane
Greg,they both look super fun
Greg,Dang
Greg,actual combos
Greg,MKleo dropped the ball
Greg,also snake's uptilt's the same lol
Greg,i already said both those things max
Greg,naw that was honestly all zero
Greg,he's a sneaky bastard
Greg,it's nuts
Greg,The set up from snake in the beginning of the final stock
Greg,This game looks dope
Greg,wait is there rage?
Greg,I actually want a switch now
Greg,yeah :(
Greg,rip
Greg,if the game's this intense day 1 I'm looking forward to it
Greg,rage is actually the most dumb mechanic
Greg,like sure there's some clear similarities to sm4sh so people get a head start but still
Greg,yeah rage is weird
Greg,rage?
Greg,"higher your %, more knockback"
Greg,ah
Greg,makes it super hard to kill when you're at low % and easy to make comebacks
Greg,and also hard to combo low % people when you're at high %
Greg,How did MKLeo all 3 of those characters
Greg,I mean
Greg,2 smash 4 top tiers and snake
Greg,or it makes it easier to roll your opponent @Sak von Sak
Greg,"it seems like it was gonna make heavies really good cause they can live to high percents and kill before other people get to high, but heavies still kinda sucked"
Greg,yeah that too
Greg,Bay Vs. Ride mhmmm
Greg,wtf is that down B!?!
Greg,wait wat
Greg,how did he die at 17%
Greg,items LOL
Greg,lol
Greg,lol bayo
Greg,fuck
Greg,Bayo needs to be nerfed
Greg,she's back
Greg,FML
Greg,She looks kind of fun not gonna lie
Greg,true
Greg,she's just old dumb bayo
Greg,gimme interesting bayo
Greg,not the same combo
Greg,although that might have been partially just ridley being huge
Greg,^ yeah
Greg,but sstill
Greg,that was hella dumb
Greg,bigger hitbox = easy combo
Greg,still the fact that she can do that to anyone is depressing
Greg,she is just dumb combo
Greg,Hype best of 3
Greg,maybe 2 sets
Greg,tfw WWE super star and it is not John Cena
Greg,oh hype spirit tracks music
Greg,I think
Greg,LOL WUT
Greg,nairo with a bunch of scrubs?
Greg,this is gonna be a slaughter
Greg,Nairo about to destroy some noobs
Greg,who allowed this
Greg,lololol
Greg,Secretly pro players
Greg,he's still gonna slaughter em
Greg,Lol
Greg,3 v 1 
Greg,3v1
Greg,items and no team attack might swing it a bit
Greg,this is great
Greg,Can Nairo do it?
Greg,no
Greg,Nairo is about to get raped
Greg,he can but it'll be tough
Greg,items are good
Greg,he's one of the best sm4sh players
Greg,like the big three are zero mkleo and him
Greg,SNAKE!?!
Greg,also nairo's got a chance cause I think he just needs the most kills total
Greg,the crowd is singing the DK RAP LOL
Greg,i thought its was stocks ez for nairo
Greg,the taunt combo
Greg,poggers
Greg,what a god
Greg,+30 win inbound
Greg,
Greg,picking a heavy was pretty smart
Greg,I want to see the score ffs
Greg,Finally no items
Greg,or smash balls
Greg,and best of 3
Greg,lets go
Greg,mildly serious match
Greg,and a real stage
Greg,zero playing smash 4 lol
Greg,
Greg,bayo's not as busted hurray
Greg,it was just ridley being massive
Greg,I'm glad the neutral b has more knockback tho cause it suuuucked before
Greg,good balancing act
Greg,The bullets?
Greg,yeah
Greg,bullets were as if fox had 2 guns
Greg,is MkLeo going to de throne ZeRo?
Greg,dunno if really counts as a dethroning
Greg,zero's been retired
Greg,true
Greg,how old is ZeRo
Greg,?
Greg,mid twenties I think?
Greg,mkleo's like seventeen tho
Greg,he is 23
Greg,just found it online
Greg,the end of a pro gamer age is around 23-25 apparently
Greg,Why does Mario have no moves with Cappy? 
Greg,cause then he would be garbage lol
Greg,unless they were to make it like link's boomerang
Greg,I mean there's a lot of smashers over 25
Greg,most good csgo players are > 25
Greg,zero didnt permenantly retire
Greg,Why did he retire?
Greg,stress
Greg,the Brain in the Human body starts to decline brain activity around 25 and onward
Greg,It may not be this case
Greg,thats not true
Greg,excuse me?
Greg,Do you really want to do this over the knowledge of the human body?
Greg,the reason most esports players retire is burnout not physical decline
Greg,"After 25 your reaction time, multitasking capability and and memory begin to slip."
Greg,"Mario vs. Sonic
ResidentSleeper"
Greg,Where's your source?
Greg,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319185.php

Greg,How Your Brain Changes With Age
Greg,"Take control of your brain health by learning about how your brain changes as you age, and techniques to stay sharp."
Greg,Not like it matters cause when I showed you sources before you did not take it seriously anyways lol
Greg,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19542656/your-brain-as-you-age/
Greg,Has Your Brain Already Peaked?
Greg,New research from MIT suggests that mental decline begins far younger than is typically thought
Greg,anyways
Greg,YAY ZeRo!
Greg,yeah but neither of those things is super important for smash
Greg,and it's such a slow decline at first
Greg,that experience is more important
Greg,"like, there's street fighter players in their 30's"
Greg,"very true, exactly"
Greg,wow daigo is 37
Greg,I didn't realize he was that old
Greg,people with higher still take longer to age
Greg,the age of retirement for both sports and esports is getting higher and higher
Greg,so it the age of how long people live
Greg,your point?
Greg,federer is almost 37 and he still dominates when he is playing well
Greg,that is my point
Greg,i was just noting something interesting
Greg,is he a very high skilled player?
Greg,like Top teir?
Greg,leffen on the right
Greg,both players me and kameron have mentioned are old and still top 5 in their respective (e)sports
Greg,then it is a correlation between the amount of skill the person has and the rate that the skill of a person declines. All I was saying is that the decline starts at the approximate age of 25. nothing else.
Greg,you said their careers are basically over at 25
Greg,which is provably not true
Greg,hell it should be even worse in sports cause your physical skills also decline but it's still entirely possible to keep at it
Greg,"I said ""the end"" not drop dead over  or done."
Greg,The ending of a carrer does not have to be a drop dead date just a time period
Greg,Is anything else happening today or is that it?
Greg,I thought we were getting some sort of reveal
Greg,Stream went dark
Greg,F
Greg,Is it over then?
Greg,weird ass ending

if list is sorted
    return list
else
    destroy the universe"

Greg,Tfw when you knock yourself out by standing up too quick and hitting the open cash register
Greg,Gg
Greg,@Max where you at homie
Greg,@Homies my parents dont think I should use the PC tonight
Greg,Because concussion
Greg,how bad is it?
Greg,It's extra strong yeet 90%
Greg,@Jed if you see Astoria at camp tell her she's a crazy bitch
Greg,How did you get that diagnosed already?
Greg,"Didnt actually. ER wait times were a few hours so I yoted home. I feel better though. Might be something minor, I did black  out though LOL"
Greg,Hours long wait times at the ER sounds dangerous
Greg,you get bumped at ER based on seriousness of your condition
Greg,"hence how that time I thought I might have broken my wrist, I was in a nearly empty ER and still had a super long wait casue people with more pressing stuff kept showing up"
Greg,"also, be very careful about concussions, if it's not feeling better tomorrow get it checked out"
Greg,"cause they can cause serious long-term problems, especially if you don't realize you have one"
Greg,@Trapezoider
Greg,I am going to see my actual doctor tomorrow
Greg,@Sak von Sak when did you break your wrist
Greg,"I didn't, but I did do a decent amount of damage"
Greg,in an entertainly stupid sequence of events
Greg,"my house is near the top of a hill, and me and my brother decided it'd be fun to go down the hill on these -"
Greg,"together, holding on to one another"
Greg,m
Greg,or
Greg,on
Greg,and taking turns throwing the other person further down to pick up speed
Greg,and then their extra speed would be a boost to the other person
Greg,"basically we eventually messed up, I hit a lawn, flew over it onto the sidewalk, and caught all my weight on a bad angle on my wrist"
Greg,"it didn't break, but I messed up the bone and the connective tissue and stuff"
Greg,hurt like hell
Greg,and I was still in a sling/brace for a few weeks
Greg,sylki
Greg,you are a god damned legend
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,help us find your island
Greg,we are finna tryna connect it
Greg,There's a nether portal to it
Greg,through my portal?
Greg,yeah but we wanna railway
Greg,Look at the coordinates
Greg,"pffft today I learned that there's a speedrunning category for ocarina of time called ""dank percent"" where the goal is to get off a bug that makes it look like link is smoking a giant blunt as fast as you can"
Greg,yee
Greg,and it's officially recognized on speedrun.com
Greg,world record at just over eight and a half minutes
Greg,I'm just skimming the other officially recognized categories for this game and some are hilarious
Greg,"like ""Go Home and Die %"", where the goal is to die while inside a house as fast as possible"
Greg,What is the record for that one?
Greg,8m18s
Greg,there's also a category to complete the game without ever opening any doors
Greg,"there's a category to complete the game all the way to the water temple, and then while inside get to a total of 37 small keys"
Greg,@Sak von Sak have you seen full metal alchemist
Greg,he thinks its overrated
Greg,i think zacks overrated
Greg,ava sums it up nicely
Greg,"it's a solid show, but beyond the first chunk I felt like it just gets larger, more unweildy, and slower, and nothing it does beyond a few early bits really stood out to me"
Greg,it just feels like a decently executed generic show that gets worse as it goes on
Greg,"I agree, full metal alchemist is overrated."
Greg,"I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it, at least not before a lot of other things"
Greg,Especially brotherhood.
Greg,"I haven't seen the original, but from what I've heard, it's even more filled with fluff"
Greg,I'm one of those people who doesn't watch main stream anime. I stick to the more lesser know stuff.
Greg,"And to me, (a true anime fan), main stream animes are just... Not good animes."
Greg,how do you define a true anime fan
Greg,?
Greg,A true anime fan is someone who enjoys other animes then mainstream.
Greg,"I would have gone with just ""a person who enjoys anime, regardless of other peoples' opinions of any given anime"""
Greg,"Also, I feel like to be a true anime fan, you have to watch at least 5 different animes that aren't mainstream."
Greg,also just in general I feel like there's literally no reason to subdivide a community and it'll only cause problems and toxicity and elitism
Greg,both of those defintion are super arbitrary
Greg,being a fan should be whatever you think it is
Greg,True.
Greg,I'm only saying what I define it as for myself
Greg,idk i just find the gate keeping shit to be really autistic
Greg,"@mrd256  stop being an elitist, that is so stupid. Anyone who says you have to watch non-mainstream anime to be a ""true anime fan"" is just trying way too hard to look cool and feel above other people. It literally doesn't matter at all. You're not special because you watch things that less people think are good. Get off your high horse."
Greg,"Also, as someone who had an obsession with Yu-gi-oh for years you have no right to try to be cool lol"
Greg,"on another note you said watch five anime that aren't mainstream. FIVE???? That's it? If you want to go on about ""true anime fans"" it should at least be someone who has seen a heck of a lot of anime. My list is up in the 80's (which isn't even all that much). Beat that, rookie."
Greg,Who said I only watched five?
Greg,"okay hot shot, how much anime have you watched?"
Greg,but honestly it doesn't even matter
Greg,people are entitled to like whatever anime they like and I think all people's opinions are equally valid because they're just opinions about stupid entertainment media and it doesn't matter
Greg,and this is coming from someone who has watch both mainstream and non-mainstream anime
Greg,"@Feral Nebula It's probably not as much as you, but I have watched more than 5
Owari no Seraph
Ore no Twintail narimasu
Kissxsis
High School DXD
Date A Live
Angel Beats
Charlotte
Erased (even though I hated it)
Fuuka 
Rakudai kishi no Cavalry
Miira no Kaitaka
The Devil is a part timer
Shinmai Maou no Testament
Caligula
and I can list more if I need to"
Greg,I didn't need a list lol
Greg,you asked for it
Greg,that's only 14 lol
Greg,and isn't Kissxsis an incest anime ???
Greg,still more than 5!
Greg,isn't it hentai?
Greg,but it's a gulty pleasure
Greg,pffft
Greg,no it's not a hentai
Greg,I stay away from hentai at all costs
Greg,okay buddy
Greg,also tbh most of those anime ARE mainstream. Maybe not as mainstream as naruto or FMAB but they are still well known. And the ones that aren't on your list are just plain bad lol
Greg,well yeah
Greg,then what kinda point are you tryna prove ????
Greg,"big animes like Naruto, One Piece, Boku no Hero Academia, FLCL, and others of such are ones I try to stay away from"
Greg,FLCL????
Greg,is that mainstream??
Greg,the new series
Greg,I forget what it's called.
Greg,I know what you're talking about but that anime is not mainstream as much as naruto ect.
Greg,"whatever, believe what you want to believe"
Greg,lol okay
Greg,have fun thinking you're cooler than you are
Greg,the real answer is none of us are cool because we all watch anime
Greg,coming from a girl says she's a weeboo
Greg,"I just called myself uncool too, you know"
Greg,but the weeb thing is a joke. I'm not the actual definition of a weeaboo
Greg,I never said I was cool. I was just trying to say I don't like to watch (many) mainstream animes
Greg,"right, but when people are being elitist they are trying to make themselves look higher than others"
Greg,"""a true anime fan"""
Greg,I'm just trying to say that is a toxic mindset
Greg,I didn't say I was the only one
Greg,I didn't say you said that wym ???
Greg,throws arms in the air and gives up
Greg,later
Greg,haha
Greg,I'm so amused
Greg,"slides back in briefly
in all fairness, as much as the 'true anime fan' thing is often toxic and elitest, the majority of the toxicity and elitism in this conversation is coming from ava"
Greg,"so get off yo high horse, ava"
Greg,whaaaaat
Greg,Im not ! !
Greg,   thank you Zack!
Greg,people who use that emoji unironically should die
Greg,it's just hard to talk to stupid people so I'm sorry if I sounded toxic
Greg,"let's see:
you called him a rookie,
one of his shows a hentai,
laughed at his guilty pleasure,
told him most of what he'd seen was bad,
etc., I'm too lazy to pick through the rest of this"
Greg,also that is one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard
Greg,because you insulted him during the apology
Greg,I largely agree with your general opinion about stuff but you're arguing it so badly
Greg,I wasn't trying to be sincere lol
Greg,also I called it a hentai because i genuinely thought it was
Greg,whoops
Greg,but anyway I was saying all that stuff because he thought he was too good and I wanted to knock him down I guess
Greg,"anyhoo, this whole discussion is such a mess that I would genuinely prefer to go back to work than continue having it, so I'm out"
Greg,woah
Greg,sorry Sylki
Greg,well that conversation got out of hand real fast lol
Greg,Holy shit
Greg,I ask Zack if he has seen a show I'm watching
Greg,And the retard fort opens the floodgates of autism
Greg,"goddammit I'm on hold and they go ""press the pound sign to not have to listen to music"""
Greg,so I did
Greg,and instead they're now just advertising themselves
Greg,this is not what I wanted
Greg,Who you calling sylk boi
Greg,a hosting service cause the hosting's all fucked up
Greg,why are all the hardest parts of getting a website going things that have nothing to do with making the website
Greg,i know right its some stupid ass shit
Greg,@Zain has Daniel contacted you? I think I'm going to rape him on your behalf
Greg,no not yet

Greg,I mean I use the rocky theme song for that
Greg,okay
Greg,Keep listening to 500 miles
Greg,HOpe you can find a solution to whatever problems are plagueing your work
Greg,"it's like,
if this man can walk 500 miles to demonstrate his dedication to some chick, I can at least get this dumb thing done"

Greg,"I mean, you don't see any marios in top 10 these days"
Greg,he's 15th now
Greg,I was saying that we had figured out he was bad
Greg,"it's more just, how had top players not figured out how to beat roy"
Greg,This guy must have just been good
Greg,"Also, the cc meta pretty much didn't exist then"
Greg,fair
Greg,"still, step it up 2005 melee"
Greg,If any of us went back to 2004-5 melee we probably could have been top players. With how far the meta has come I imagine an average player today could be excellent

Greg,yeah but they got onion rings round 2
Greg,also stuffing got fucked
Greg,deserved way better than round 1 vs garlic bread
Greg,Garlic was seed 2 stuffing was seed 15
Greg,thats how it goes
Greg,ok but
Greg,what even is rice pilaf
Greg,^
Greg,tomato bisque???
Greg,it's a soup
Greg,thats just soup
Greg,a decent one
Greg,also stuffing is barely a side
Greg,but how common even is that
Greg,thats why its seeded low
Greg,"also I agree, stuffing is like,, a holiday only food"
Greg,Still a side though
Greg,yeah but barely tho hence the seed
Greg,that's like doing a pie tourney and sticking pumpkin pie super low
Greg,just cause it's mostly a thanksgiving thing

Greg,That was so close
Greg,he'd better go ham in loser's

Greg,I've ended up half working and half watching other games cause melee's still pretty meh for the most part
Greg,I'm currently watching one of the most busted and poorly balanced fighting games of all time that's being run at a side event at evo
Greg,Which game is that?
Greg,it's this ancient snes sailor moon fighting game
Greg,"there's two torontonians in winner's finals, so I'm hyped for that, I guess"
Greg,also they both play hilariously busted characters so I can't wait to see that match
Greg,link?
Greg,"one character has absurd range on all her moves, a full screen dash, and a really strong command grab
the other one is crazy fast, and if they get under around 1/6 health they can stall infinitely and slowly chip you down until you have less health than them at timeout and they win"

Greg,"lololol toph's playing and his full tag shows up as ""THE READS Toph"""
Greg,yo who won the wobbles kjh set @Sak von Sak
Greg,kjh
Greg,wobbles wasn't wobbling
Greg,he did some cool handoffs though
Greg,he prolly wants to commentate
Greg,I figure he's mostly just there to have fun
Greg,and also commentate
Greg,but yeah
Greg,goddammit
Greg,the stream went down and this is the last thing we see
Greg,I saw a few more seconds and can confirm the uptilt missed

Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,Finna fight me at 9:15
Greg,good sheik players make sheik look like such a good character
Greg,whereas bad spacies make spacies look trash lol
Greg,I dont get why fox players ban to battlefield vs sheik
Greg,when most sheik players counterpick battlefield
Greg,just ban bfield and then FOD or yoshis based on preference
Greg,they could leverage the stage advantage so much more
Greg,"As a sheik player, which stage do you prefer against foxes"
Greg,i mean it doesnt really matter cause im not very good
Greg,colbol beat amsa
Greg,imo the fox-yoshi matchup is like 65-35
Greg,RISHI BEAT M2K
Greg,SMASH GOD
Greg,wouldnt it be sick if there was a top player who was a puff/marth dual main?
Greg,like what if hbox had m2k's marth
Greg,Then they would be unstoppable
Greg,@Mr. Airplane wanna watch Evo when I get home from work?
Greg,melee with the most viewers at evo rn
Greg,SWEDISH BEAT ARMADA

Greg,Why is this happening?
Greg,join the cord ill explain
Greg,@Zain Is darwin project good?
Greg,I like it
Greg,Is it a game that could be played together or is it only solo queue?
Greg,@Melee this training pack is actually really really cool
Greg,highly recommended
Greg,Lololol I didn't see sm4sh grands but what I'm hearing about it sounds hilarious
Greg,Bayo dittos
Greg,Whole crowd booing
Greg,Apparently at one point they both sat on opposite ends of the stage and charged neutral b for so long a TO had to come out and give them shit about it
Greg,Game's dead I think
Greg,Or maybe this is what happens when #1 and #2 can't make evo
Greg,Nobody fucking cares about that game anymore
Greg,Melee is still hype
Greg,Bayo and Cloud were the worst things to ever happen to smash 4
Greg,It was pretty balanced before then
Greg,The list of viable characters was pretty long
Greg,But still fundamentally boring to play and watch
Greg,They are playing the DK rap on the evo stream lol
Greg,"also, at least cloud is actually fairly fun to watch, compared to a lot of the cast"
Greg,bayo not so much
Greg,Guy with a smash ultimate shirt standing behind the players
Greg,Announcement incoming?
Greg,I think the leaks said something was supposed to get announced at evo
Greg,They did
Greg,"and even without that, evo's a pretty good time to announce anything about a fighting game"
Greg,I think a few other games have had little announcements already
Greg,hey I overslept is this the first match @Max
Greg,There have not been any games yet
Greg,fantastic
Greg,did i miss anything on the stream
Greg,no
Greg,fantastic
Greg,YO HBOX
Greg,he just took 3 stocks in like 40 seconds
Greg,why did he ban fd and not stadium?
Greg,I think FD is worse
Greg,Right call imo
Greg,hot take leffen wins evo
Greg,Lets go
Greg,wow
Greg,"3 stock in hbox's favour, last hit, 3 stock in leffen's favour"
Greg,wack set
Greg,just to note my message was before stock 1 of the 3rd game
Greg,Amazing not to tilt after game 1
Greg,although real talk hbox was flubbing left and right
Greg,I say he's either gonna crumble or go on a nutty loser's run
Greg,time to cheer for wizzy over swedish
Greg,no
Greg,swedish
Greg,lets go
Greg,@Zain Mango about to play
Greg,alrightr
Greg,"I like swedish, but wizzy has a much much better record over hbox"
Greg,yeah of da sheiks
Greg,https://www.twitch.tv/evo
Greg,evo - Twitch
Greg,EVO 2018 - CHAMPIONSHIP SUNDAY
Greg,also swedish has looked good against hbox in da past
Greg,and plup beat him with sheik at CEO
Greg,We could have armada Hbox for 4th
Greg,plup is so good
Greg,and mango so bad
Greg,rip mango
Greg,that
Greg,was so sad
Greg,that was a very mango set
Greg,That was pretty good
Greg,"he played amazing for a chunk of it, mediocre for a chunk, and SD'd a bunch"
Greg,the first game was sick by plup tho
Greg,yaw first game plup was playing out of his mind
Greg,New gods winners finals
Greg,lets go
Greg,big house part 2
Greg,This is winnable
Greg,S2J has almost beat him before
Greg,"and when he did, he won the first two games"
Greg,which would be the set in this case
Greg,that'd be crazy though
Greg,I'd put like 80/20 odds on armada winning
Greg,shoutouts2jesus
Greg,
Greg,?
Greg,That's s2j
Greg,oh
Greg,someone said in chat
Greg,armada has gotten 3 stitches since being put in losers
Greg,the script boys
Greg,damnn
Greg,those stocks were spicy
Greg,SHOUTOUTS TO JESUS
Greg,hes losing on fod tho
Greg,He might opt for fd instead
Greg,huh
Greg,bfield?
Greg,S2J can do this
Greg,I wanna see armada mango
Greg,not s2j mango
Greg,chokes
Greg,rip
Greg,so many special turnips
Greg,chooooookes
Greg,s2j choked that so hard
Greg,S2j is out?
Greg,"Hey guys, I'm here from Guilty Gear, just wanted to say that I can see why you were being a bunch of immature children in chat - seeing as you literally play a kids game. Honestly, it's just sad seeing you losers spam emotes every time Mario does his jump attack or whatever. Grow up!."
Greg,What is this copy pasta
Greg,From the chat
Greg,ik
Greg,@Trapezoider S2J is out but wizzy is still in
Greg,
Greg,Waiting for this special ed kid's game to be over so I can watch some fucking tekken.
Greg,same
Greg,I HAVE A 3 WORD ESSAY DUE TOMORROW AND I'M WATCHING MELEE NotLikeThis
Greg,Why is this Swedish dude wearing sunglasses
Greg,he has eye issues
Greg,its not just for style
Greg,is winners finals b05 or just losers and grands?
Greg,I think winners finals is bo5
Greg,Leffen said so on his twitter at least
Greg,Did you guys just see the camera?
Greg,well he could just be saying that because hes gonna be in either grands or losers finals
Greg,rip
Greg,wow mango
Greg,that was... pretty bad
Greg,how does he almost always play terrible at evo
Greg,we need a better bird player
Greg,He puts a lot of pressure on himself probably
Greg,the bird must fly again
Greg,"From chat ""we live in a world where s2j took a game off armada and mango didnt... hmmmm"""
Greg,lol
Greg,"real talk tho, mango was playing really sloppy"
Greg,like s2j game 3 slop
Greg,ouch wizzy
Greg,wizzy finna save melee?
Greg,The only falcon to ever play the character correctly
Greg,yeah n0ne of course
Greg,also 1/4 of both the top 12 and top 8 were falcon players thats pretty wack
Greg,its over
Greg,bruh
Greg,damn
Greg,damn
Greg,that was super close though
Greg,hbox's pressure was so good once he had the lead though
Greg,wizzy needed space and hbox wasn't giving him any
Greg,leffen unstopable
Greg,I'll stop him
Greg,go chris
Greg,fox ditto time?
Greg,lol
Greg,rip
Greg,Leffen is so good
Greg,My inspiration
Greg,he's crazy
Greg,plup is kinda like new mew2king
Greg,he gets deflated p easy
Greg,i dont see him winning in losers
Greg,ouch
Greg,yo boys we finna play some melee after evo
Greg,this is so tense
Greg,this aint even grands
Greg,ouch
Greg,Almost a time out
Greg,clutchbox please
Greg,@Max
Greg,is wizzy still here?
Greg,no
Greg,NO
Greg,well i have no reason to watch this tream then 
Greg,rip
Greg,Melee is saved
Greg,Thank god armada won
Greg,evo is hype
Greg,hes so chubby
Greg,watch anyway
Greg,yeeees armada
Greg,Hbox doesn't even have shoes on
Greg,guys can we joinup like????
Greg,This is hype city
Greg,leffen plup armada top 3 this is pretty much as well as I could have hoped for
Greg,
Greg,its not even grand finals
Greg,plup leffen grand finals
Greg,Lets go
Greg,that's what I'm hoping for
Greg,"I want fifteen games from hereon out, and I honestly don't really care that much how they go if we get that"
Greg,My boy big leff better win this
Greg,@Melee can we all joinup for grandfinals ples
Greg,not gonna lie armada winning would be sick
Greg,no
Greg,gay^
Greg,even though i dont likeem
Greg,I kinda want the armada insane loser's run
Greg,I want to listen to the casters
Greg,armada winning would mean beating 6 of the other top 9 members
Greg,and every other top 6 player
Greg,FROM LOSERS
Greg,who did wizrobe play before hbox knocked him out
Greg,i cant see on the bracket
Greg,to get the 3vo
Greg,swedish
Greg,which other evos did armada win
Greg,2015 2017
Greg,2017 and 2015
Greg,"over hbox in 2015, mango in 2017"
Greg,yeah
Greg,mango won 2013 and 14
Greg,hbox 2016

Greg,Who is up now
Greg,armada plup loser's finals
Greg,press 1 to vote for armada
Greg,1
Greg,is this live?
Greg,yes
Greg,:0
Greg,LETS GO PLUP
Greg,wait
Greg,was the rest of the bracket 2/3?
Greg,yes
Greg,wow
Greg,it's cause it's evo
Greg,they need it to run quickly enough
Greg,also the evo top brass don't much care for melee
Greg,hence our shitty time slot
Greg,why
Greg,we bring so much to the event
Greg,Thats so dumb
Greg,cause they're old school fgc people
Greg,Dont we literally get the most viewers?
Greg,"the main head guy apparently loooooves tekken even though it doesn't get as good viewership as melee, sf, dbfz and he gave tekken a ton of preferential treatment"
Greg,thats so dumb
Greg,i didnt know the evo staff was gay
Greg,randall!!
Greg,melee in particular has a history of getting shafted in various ways at evo
Greg,this year's the worst though probably
Greg,I missed most of top 8 because of this time slot
Greg,Armada hype
Greg,Didn't we get Saturday last year
Greg,oh yeah
Greg,but at least we didn't have super early morning pools
Greg,"""Whenever I see top players do what I do. Alarm bells"""
Greg,Scar is awesome
Greg,he's a good commentator for higher level discussion of stuff
Greg,"where he's not as deep in the nitty gritty details, but he understands players and mentalities really well"
Greg,Have toph and scar done every evo?
Greg,fox is stupid
Greg,no u
Greg,YES
Greg,up air is such a dumb move
Greg,"I don't think they did the super old school evos, but I'm pretty sure they've done top 8 or at least top 4 from 2013-2018"
Greg,jbaited
Greg,"honestly, it wouldn't feel like evo at this point without scar and toph"
Greg,they are such a good combo
Greg,armada 4 stock
Greg,also real talk
Greg,how many times has plup gotten 3rd at evo
Greg,+1 more times
Greg,I feel bad
Greg,yeah plup's not looking like his normal self
Greg,the boost grab he missed was so sad
Greg,
Greg,Time for leffen to take it
Greg,ever since he beat mango he's been not looking that good
Greg,"but yeah, I think this is... 3 or 4 now"
Greg,rip
Greg,poggers?
Greg,Nintendo direct in 3 days
Greg,
Greg,pfft nintendo cop out on making an actual announcement
Greg,poggers
Greg,they announced an announcement
Greg,what a bunch of fucking champs
Greg,I dont like the evo stage this year
Greg,it was way cooler last year
Greg,
Greg,WAIT ITS THE SAME?????? It looks so different from some of these angles
Greg,"I honestly don't really care who wins this, so long as this is as good as their sets normally are"
Greg,
Greg,that nose shine
Greg,Leffen looking fresh
Greg,holy shit
Greg,what a fucking god
Greg,"""proto tractor pro tractor"
Greg,what a fucking new god
Greg,what was that???
Greg,one more
Greg,OH
Greg,oh shit

Greg,About to fight one prolly
Greg,I have almost no knowledge on that matchup. I will say though that you are good at tech chasing and should probably go for that. Just don't forget to actually lead it into moves eventually in order to really build up damage.

Greg,When's the last time you guys played a set?
Greg,prolly same time I played Ava
Greg,wait no it was
Greg,and I beat him
Greg,Then you are better than Ava
Greg,She would not be able to beat him
Greg,I've beat trap tho
Greg,wym
Greg,In a set vs his main?

Greg,these are unisex tshirts why is a medium too long for me
Greg,rip my guy
Greg,I am six feet tall
Greg,im 6'9
Greg,and they have a no returns policy
Greg,so I'm gonna have to now wait until the next time my brother visits to have a properly fitting semi-ironic in&out tshirt
Greg,just tie it in the back my guy
Greg,you don't understand how long this shirt is
Greg,if I were a girl i could plausibly wear it as a dress

Greg,are there any zerg experts?
Greg,oh right andrew
Greg,Andrew is a decent player
Greg,"so it's me and andrew, you and any terran, who's protossing?"
Greg,Don't you play Protoss?
Greg,more zerg lately
Greg,I was assuming you would be the protoss
Greg,I could
Greg,We could shuffle Andrew on to terran you to zerg and me to protoss
Greg,I prefer zerg lately but I could help with whoever's the new protoss
Greg,Kameron is the terran Zain is the zerg and Chris is the protoss
Greg,zack go back to work
Greg,"I mean we can start with me and chris, you and kameron, and andrew zain and then rotate as needed"
Greg,Sounds good
Greg,No
Greg,Why?
Greg,I don't play Terran
Greg,I only know zerg macro
Greg,The line up he listed would make you zerg
Greg,I will get bodied
Greg,When is this happening
Greg,Tonight if everyone is available I think
Greg,I mean I think no matter what the team with me as the 'experienced' player is gonna get fucked
Greg,since it is a 1v1v1 you can always shift alliances depending on who is winning
Greg,lol true

Greg,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

Greg,The more you ask the furthur away it becomes
Greg,"Boys, I found a new game for us to play"
Greg,"I'll tell you guys about it later, but it's really fun"
Greg,@Homies
Greg,whats it called?
Greg,"""I'll tell you guys about it later"""
Greg,ffs tell us the name now
Greg,so we can look into it
Greg,and play it later
Greg,No
Greg,Tell us what it is
Greg,"Ok, you twisted my arm as far as it will go"
Greg,It's not on steam by the way
Greg,It's called
Greg,Primeops
Greg,It's free at
Greg,ProductofPrimes.itch.io/Primeops
Greg,The devs are a friend of my buddy
Greg,It's real fun
Greg,Also you're gonna need a controller to play
Greg,Will Xbox work?
Greg,I'll get it tonight
Greg,I'll be home at 7:30-8 pst
Greg,Yo boys my 28 yr/old retarded sister is finally moving out
Greg,HYPE
Greg,Xbox works
Greg,"pools commentary is, although kind of crap, perfectly fitting for pools"
Greg,they're not even talking about the set except for every now and then
Greg,they're just going off on ridiculous tangents about photosynthesis
Greg,"but like, it's sfat bodying some rando"
Greg,actual commentary would be kinda weird
Greg,holy shit mango almost lost that set
Greg,Who was he against?
Greg,some random puff
Greg,he's not even top 100
Greg,Was he playing Falco?
Greg,yeah
Greg,"lololol he just walked over to the commentary and goes ""no one ever talks about my good double lasers. Those were some good double lasers that set"""
Greg,nothing about the fact that he just went last hit with some non-top 100 player
Greg,"Ok @Homies I gotta break the news to you now, I don't think the game has online multiplayer"
Greg,bummer dude
Greg,I'm becoming more and more sure that hbox takes damage on purpose once he is at 50 until he is at around 90.
Greg,Why?
Greg,So that all the easy kill setups don't work
Greg,"at around 90 you can't really upthrow upair, weak nair upsmash, I dunno if jab upsmash works (I think jab upair still works but it's hard)"
Greg,Are you guys seeing this
Greg,basically your only safe-ish kill option becomes bair at like 140
Greg,Those drawings lol
Greg,"also, n0ne 3-1'd wizzy let's go"
Greg,he's gonna get bodied by zain probably though
Greg,When I play vs puff I actually don't laser past up throw up air %
Greg,also pewpewu vs s2j should be good
Greg,oh damn moky brought shroomed to game 5
Greg,lol n0ne
Greg,he was going so ham
Greg,and then he just
Greg,jumps in the middle of a marth combo
Greg,and that's that
Greg,Did mango drop out of shine?
Greg,naw
Greg,there's two brackets to top 8
Greg,this is only one half
Greg,there's still another 32 person bracket going on after this
Greg,These stats are so pointless
Greg,They should have the openings per kill stat
Greg,That is by far the best one
Greg,or edgeguard %
Greg,Yo
Greg,What tourney is going on?
Greg,shine 2018
Greg,S2J vs Wizzy about to start
Greg,I'm sure you want to see that one
Greg,I'll watch the good

Greg,we tryna play some games kids?
Greg,man plup had such a nice run to top 8
Greg,fairly weak puff -> samus ditto -> ics
Greg,"man why are they like ""in case you sheiks are struggling with this matchup, these tips might help!"""
Greg,they don't need the help
Greg,we samuses need the help
Greg,It is probably because neither of them know what help to give Samus. Sheik knowledge is much more widely known.
Greg,fair enough
Greg,"also, apparently void (the sm4sh guy) is pretty good at dbzf"
Greg,"he made top 8 at shine, which, while not super stacked, still has a few names I recognize"
Greg,admittadly they're both names I know from different games (one from skullgirls and one from p4au) but presumably they're still pretty good
Greg,What is p4au?
Greg,persona 4 arena
Greg,I'm not sure why they add the u
Greg,possibly the full title of one of the updates? persona 4 arena ultimax?
Greg,and also possibly cause p4a might be the acronym for persona 4 the animation
Greg,duuuuck that was a free fsmash
Greg,why did you try for bair
Greg,that only would have killed on sweet spot
Greg,I honestly think he might have taken that game if he'd just done fsmash
Greg,cause he would have been winning

things that I can pick out that tie these together: female singer, on the slower/sadder end of things, variable intensity between the verse and the chorus (like, the verses are a little tamer and then the chorus hits more of an emotional intensity)"

Greg,"so for some reason, in toronto all the weeklies I used to go to are on hiatus"
Greg,but I found that there's a weekly like fifteen minutes walk from my house
Greg,the only problem: it usually only gets been 3 and 6 entrants
Greg,"is it worth my time? it won't be a great tourney probably, and their schedule is wack as hell, probably to accomadate for the fact that they're running melee, sm4sh, and pm separately cause the venue is tiny"
Greg,"on the flip side, I've got a good chance of placing in the money"
Greg,I think you should go
Greg,I probably will
Greg,just to get a little melee in
Greg,and maybe I'll also try to farm the sm4sh tournament

print('\nInterest = %0.2f' %interest)



For some reason when I am testing this and entering the roi, it spits out this"
Greg,"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""F:\PROGRAMS\calculator.py"", line 4, in <module>
    years = input(int('Duration (no. of years) ?'))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Duration (no. of years) ?'"
Greg,should be int(input('duration'))
Greg,so I dont wanna use a float value for roi
Greg,OH
Greg,this is for years
Greg,did you read the error message?
Greg,it tells you which line is going wrong
Greg,and a description of why
Greg,IVE Never debugged
Greg,i didnt get what the mans was trying to tell me
Greg,im using Thonny as my editor
Greg,"in this case, that there was something going wrong with the int() funciton, specifically that the arguments you gave it were invalid"
Greg,"at the very least, that should tell you where and what is going wrong"
Greg,"it has the problem after the roi bit because once you input the roi, it tries to run the next line of code, which has the error"
Greg,i fixed it
Greg,now i got another bug
Greg,ayo
Greg,i made a calculator. @Sak von Sak whats another easy beginning project I can work on
Greg,one I had fun with was making a text adventure game
Greg,oh wow
Greg,that sounds difficult
Greg,ill give it a go
Greg,do you know how to do loops yet?
Greg,cause you're gonna need em
Greg,no sir
Greg,i know how to print
Greg,how to make variables
Greg,ok step one learn how to do for and while loops
Greg,that with what you already know should be enough
Greg,thank you sack
Greg,@Homies what's the biggest mistake New comers make when learning a programming language? What's the most common trap to fall into that will set you back instead of progressing your learning
Greg,this question makes no sense
Greg,yea
Greg,i mean i guess
Greg,i think people shouldnt focus
Greg,on syntax and the language in it self
Greg,more on what they wanna make in it
Greg,incorrect syntax
Greg,but i dont
Greg,think
Greg,theres
Greg,much that could set you back
Greg,when learning a language
Greg,Why would you need to need to make that 5 messages
Greg,"programming isn't like english where you can do something wrong without noticing, if something is wrong in programming it wont work period"
Greg,so if things are working you're gucci
Greg,and if they aren't figure out why
Greg,ayyy anyone wanna play some ow or melee later? @Homies

Greg,"A little tip that might help you @Trapezoider is to plan, either in your head or on a piece of paper, what the main function of your program is probably gonna look like"
Greg,ye
Greg,think about the process before the code
Greg,Just jumping straight into it can get confusing
Greg,and make you lose track
Greg,Planning I feel can also help with the efficiency of your program

Greg,I sure wouldn't write an essay like that
Greg,I mean
Greg,its an opinion so as long as its written well it'd work
Greg,This is the kind of thing where I would have to get to know the prof before making the call on whether it would be okay to write such a paper.

Greg,@Zain Don't leave without talking with me real quick please
Greg,ok
Greg,"aight so if I get a switch it's ~$380, but if I get a switch and either BoTW or Odessey it's ~$420 (so basically $40 for a game I was planning on getting anyway)

which should I go for?"
Greg,Personally I think I would go for Odyssey
Greg,If you like more of a 3d platform-ish style with a more linear story
Greg,It's movement is fantastic and really satisfying to pull off
Greg,There is a lot of content in the game if you like going and collecting the moons
Greg,The puzzles in the game are fun and interesting
Greg,The capture mechanic is also really fun
Greg,..........
Greg,BotW on the other hand
Greg,Is more if you like an open world adventure type game with a non-linear story that you get to explore at your own discretion
Greg,I find the fighting very rewarding in this game but sometimes I feel that the weapons break too quickly for my liking
Greg,hm
Greg,"If you're looking for a traditional Zelda game with lots of dungeons and boss fights, there are only a handful of them in the game"
Greg,But I liked the shrines enough to fulfil the dungeon portion
Greg,I just wish there were more bosses
Greg,"The exploring and doing whatever you want though is the main draw for the game, collecting things to make food and potions, doing side quests, taking out hordes of enemies, completing shrines to upgrade yourself"
Greg,"I'm thinking I'll probably go with odessey, cause the other game I'm gonna get is xenoblade, which  will probably be good for my fix of more open world-ish stuff"
Greg,all the exploration stuff and the story stuff 'n stuff
Greg,Glad that I could help
Greg,
Greg,I'm planning on spending my entire first week's paycheck (after taxes) on games and stuff
Greg,"including a proper hard drive so I'll finally not be able to make the ""it won't fit on my teeny tiny hard drive"" excuse"
Greg,Zack make sure you get botw at some point
Greg,Definitely one of those games you really gotta play at some point

Greg,"for me personally, i feel like oddessy loses it's charm and collecting moons becomes boring after a while. while everytime i come back to zelda i learn something new or find more shit."
Greg,i have alot more hours into zelda and still feel like i haven't found everything
Greg,while oddessy feels like a grind
Greg,"350 ish hours into zelda
120 ish into oddessy"
Greg,"xenoblade is pretty linear btw. and bombards you with sidequests up the butt that you can't beat till later, or you do so many sidequests that you are overleveled"
Greg,also get the dlc for xenoblade its amazing
Greg,I will once I'm done the main game
Greg,I'm with rainbow on the Mario thing
Greg,I didn't even beat the game because I lost interest and found it boring
Greg,You guys are a couple of hosers
Greg,ill vacuum your fucking pork sword dweeb
Greg,Finish Odyssey then come talk to me
Greg,
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,melee?
Greg,"alright, I've now got a 2TB hard drive, a switch, two games for it, and pokemon sun arriving within the next week"
Greg,I am significantly less rich than I was ten minutes ago
Greg,feelsgoodman
Greg,wait did you choose oddessy or zelda
Greg,very important question
Greg,ZELDA IS BETTER AND HAS WAY MORE HOURS IN IT
Greg,im pretty sure you didnt read the entire thing correctly
Greg,you missed ODDESSY LOSES ITS CHARM
Greg,also zelda has more content than oddessy
Greg,especially if you include the dlc
Greg,you're all too late I got odessey already
Greg,i can lend you zelda
Greg,I'm gonna get both at some point and early on I'd rather have more gameplay variety
Greg,oh we should exchange switch codes
Greg,it won't arrive till tuesday
Greg,rip
Greg,I don't think Odyssey loses its charm at all
Greg,i meant more like. it doesnt captivate you to continue playing after you beat it
Greg,"i beat the main story, got like 50 more moons then got bored of the game"
Greg,because its the same shit
Greg,It did for me
Greg,I got all of them
Greg,Except like 2 because idk where they are
Greg,;-;
Greg,I got around 400 moons? i dont remember...
Greg,most of the moons are placed so easily
Greg,and served no challenge to me
Greg,the more challenging moons are placed so bs with no room for creativity
Greg,especially the darker side
Greg,I'm not saying oddessy is a bad game. im just saying that botw offers more. and would be the game i would recommend first.

Greg,personality type
Greg,thats what I am
Greg,ENTJ here
Greg,I feel like im a mix between entj and entj
Greg,Is this personality test even good? @SWIRL GIRL
Greg,there's no real evidence supporting its validity
Greg,I just think its fun to think about
Greg,the big five is another personality test that has a lot more research behind it if anyone wants another test to take
Greg,That's the good one
Greg,My distributions are as follows
Greg,"Openness: 93rd %
Conscientiousness: 67th %
Extraversion: 98th %
Agreeablesness: 0th%
Neuroticism: 3rd %"
Greg,@Trapezoider What trait would make someone have a high level of skepticism?
Greg,Low openness
Greg,And possibly high neuroticism
Greg,Both of which run in your family
Greg,Which family member are you referring to?
Greg,Both your mother and your father
Greg,You also got high conscientiousness from your dad
Greg,Personality tests are really stupid
Greg,You are really stupid

Greg,down to clown for a bit
Greg,is short hop needle cancel fair a thing? @Melee
Greg,cause I feels like that'd be pretty effective
Greg,I don't think a short hop provides enough airtime to both needle and do a fair.
Greg,it does I tested it
Greg,as long as you dont fast fall
Greg,you can do it
Greg,I would guess people avoid it because you can stil cc the fair while needle grab cannot be cc'd and it provides a greater potential punish.
Greg,no needle cancel fair
Greg,like threaten needles into fair
Greg,I've never really seen that
Greg,you cant needle into fair
Greg,or maybe like needle cancel tomahawk
Greg,@Max did you do thanksgiving dinner already
Greg,yes
Greg,same
Greg,My family prefers to do it more for lunch then for dinner
Greg,yuck
Greg,after reading reddit for awhile a lot of casual/smash 4 players seem to think melee sucks because a lot of characters are unviable and the roster is small
Greg,but like there are more varied character archetypes than any of the other games
Greg,and arguable still more viable characters than sm4sh lol
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL @Zain alright I just won 3 soloq games in a row on lucio so lets trio what could go wrong

Greg,Ok @Homies
Greg,I found out who the guy banging on my door was
Greg,Who?
Greg,So
Greg,little background
Greg,Did you kick his ass?
Greg,Mike yesterday ordered a new microphone on Amazon
Greg,And it was supposed to come in today
Greg,Like before 9:00pm
Greg,So another little background
Greg,We never get stuff delivered to our door
Greg,because we are in a building and you need a key to access it
Greg,and our mailbox is too small
Greg,"so they leave it at the front desk of the main building, and they will send an email saying that they have your package"
Greg,"So he gets the email from the delivery man saying that the thing is delivered, and he's now waiting for the email from the front desk"
Greg,It's been like 30 minutes at this point
Greg,so he decides to check the original email
Greg,and in it there's a picture of the door to our room
Greg,with the package on the floor
Greg,So
Greg,This guy somehow got inside of our building
Greg,Went to our door
Greg,knocked
Greg,and fucking BOOKED IT
Greg,"Like I heard the knock, got up and peered through the peephole"
Greg,"and there was nothing, or nobody in the hallway"
Greg,"Again a knock, the same thing happens"
Greg,"nothing, and noone"
Greg,So it seems like this company hired literally the Flash to deliver packages
Greg,because I immediately got up to check the door and nobody was in sight
Greg,Elusive as fuck
Greg,Maybe he just ducked down
Greg,But why would he do that
Greg,It's literally his job to deliver the package
Greg,Then again
Greg,Why would he run away at mach 10

Greg,@Max
Greg,I think my endeavor for internet has finally ended
Greg,You got it working?
Greg,I have found a solution yes
Greg,Awesome
Greg,The correct solution is usually the simplest one
Greg,"I tried a few different ways of turning my phone into a hotspot without data, tethering, Bluetooth"
Greg,Tried some weird app that was supposed to work
Greg,Just wouldn't connect
Greg,So I just tried looking up how to connect my switch to the WiFi at my school
Greg,All I have to do is email some tech support desk to put my switch on a whitelist so that it can connect
Greg,Praise Reddit
Greg,so you can play smash?
Greg,"Hell yeah I can. I just need to send the email, I'm gonna do it later today"
Greg,also 4 days 
Greg,longest 4 days of my life
Greg,Yeah no kidding. I wish it wasn't exam time right now though
Greg,grumbles 22 days for me
Greg,Wait why?
Greg,@Max you at school?
Greg,I just got back
Greg,Why?
Greg,@Mr. Airplane
Greg,melee?
Greg,sure
Greg,one sec
Greg,Not going to be able to talk or play high apm characters
Greg,Ava is still doing school
Greg,90f124d8
Greg,@The Rona not allowed to buy things during December to avoid overlaps with Christmas so I've gotta wait till the 25th to either receive or buy it
Greg,Feels bad man
Greg,Yup
Greg,It'd be less annoying if I was in exams and it'd be a good excuse to nor waste studying time
Greg,But I'm working so it just kinda sucks
Greg,Should have pre-purchased  the game before December 
Greg,@Sak von Sak whatchu mean not allowed
Greg,ur an adult
Greg,with a job
Greg,I mean I could but I don't out of fear of familial ostracization
Greg,?
Greg,why
Greg,I guess me and Chris will just have an 18 day head start on you then.
Greg,Hell yeah
Greg,My Incineroar is gonna be popping off
Greg,My name is weird now
Greg,How did you do that?
Greg,Some random guy in the UWaterloo discrod had it
Greg,So I stole it
Greg,is that supposed to be a really big uwu?
Greg,I think so
Greg,lol
Greg,I'm just gonna leech off people every weekend
Greg,Come leech off of me
Greg,Actually don't
Greg,At least not until the 18th
Greg,You're kinda far
Greg,Also I generally have an advantage from having played more sm4sh
Greg,I hope to be able to catch up within a month but that might be too ambitious
Greg,Assuming the game is fun
Greg,I might just not like it
Greg,Well see
Greg,Aren't you in Toronto Zack?
Greg,Oh are you back atm? As opposed to waterloo?
Greg,After the 18th I am
Greg,Sweet
Greg,Although I have non-weekend time off until the 24th
Greg,@Sak von Sak Which characters are you interested in for Ultimate?
Greg,"Pichu, wolf, zelda, inceneroar are my main ones"
Greg,Why not pikachu?
Greg,Cause apparently pichu isn't awful
Greg,but pikachu is probably #1 in the game
Greg,The new Zelda looks kinda okay for once
Greg,"A) don't have much faith in pre release tier lists
B) when have I ever cared about how good a character is over how much fun I have with them"
Greg,She will probably be top tier
Greg,Also yeah I'm hyped for good zelda
Greg,I played some brawl recently and I still love brawl zelda
Greg,"I'm interested in Snake, Simon, Ike, Bayonetta, and Meta Knight."
Greg,So I'm excited for her not sucking
Greg,8c38e79c
Greg,wait
Greg,sm5sh is out?
Greg,Friday
Greg,Get 5mash @Trapezoider
Greg,they're calling it 5mash??? lol
Greg,how is that even pronounced
Greg,I have no idea
Greg,I just did it because Andrew wrote it the other way
Greg,oh
Greg,Near the games announcement people were calling it smush
Greg,I prefer 5ma5h
Greg,"Or, if you're picky, 5mu5h"
Greg,I like Ultimate
Greg,"Pronounced ""five-muh-five-hrrrr"""
Greg,Like the Hebrew throat h sound
Greg,My switch now has internet!

Greg,Thanks buddy
Greg,yo kids
Greg,crisis averted
Greg,purchasing 5ma5h
Greg,:pog:
Greg,What changed your mind?
Greg,well the main thing preventing me was a family rule about not buying stuff for yourself during december to avoid undercutting other people's christmas gifts
Greg,but I just kinda asked if I could anyway
Greg,you could also just
Greg,do it without asking
Greg,^
Greg,"Wow you really didn't want to see me that much, huh?"
Greg,You should get better internet for christmas
Greg,"well if I didn't ask, I run the risk of having the game, getting it as a gift, and that being both a) real awkward and b) a wasted gift"
Greg,also I literally have zero control over the terrible internet
Greg,it has to do with the line into our house
Greg,It used to not be this bad
Greg,hey guys guess what
Greg,What?
Greg,What?
Greg,UwU whats this
Greg,"Hey guys, let's kill @Mr. Airplane"
Greg,"@Mr. Airplane 
Spider GF: Catches you in her web
Spider GF: 88w88 whats this"
Greg,this man
Greg,its me
Greg,@Max how do you asdi?
Greg,I hate you
Greg,DOn't answer him
Greg,hold the cstick when in hitlag
Greg,...
Greg,You dissapoint me
Greg,?
Greg,how
Greg,do I not press it before hand
Greg,holding the cstick does not require pressing a button
Greg,no
Greg,do I hold it before the hit starts?
Greg,you can
Greg,why isnt it working then?
Greg,but if you are not in hitstun you will do a move
Greg,asdi is only 1 sdi input and usually isn't enough to make a differnece
Greg,i mean asdi down
Greg,why would you want to do that
Greg,
Greg,im holding the cstick
Greg,but i still go up
Greg,What is the situation here?
Greg,Are you edgeguarding?
Greg,this is an uncle punch challenge
Greg,what % are you at?
Greg,at really low % sometimes asdi down tech doesn't work
Greg,well it SHOULD work cause its literally built into the game
Greg,I don't really know what this even is
Greg,
Greg,(that means that it isn't important)
Greg,That isn't what I mean
Greg,I don't know the situation where you are trying to use this
Greg,i just feel like the asdi down isnt working
Greg,is ALL i need to do hold the cstick down?
Greg,I think so
Greg,You could try both sticks though
Greg,did
Greg,What % are you at
Greg,maybe asdi just like doesnt work on my controller
Greg,that is important
Greg,max
Greg,its a simulation
Greg,it should work
Greg,MODS... can... be... broken...
Greg,try taunting
Greg,this one is pretty trustworthy tho
Greg,I'm not joking
Greg,
Greg,Maybe you are not timing everything correctly
Greg,I really don't know
Greg,you should really download this modpack
Greg,i wanna see how many sdi inputs you can get on the upthrow upair sim
Greg,i usually get 1 or 2
Greg,which upon doing  r e s e a r c h
Greg,should be enough to get out of upthrow upair p consistently
Greg,but I know your good at it
Greg,Maybe I'll get it when I go on break
Greg,it seems like its prolly humanly impossible to get more than 3 inputs so I guess im doing it right
Greg,melee is sick
Greg,It is definitely possible to get at least 4
Greg,either way im pretty sure 2 is really good
Greg,https://twitter.com/unclepunch_/status/992525190063099905?lang=en
Greg,"Event #13 is ASDI-Down Tech Practice. When you taunt, Marth will be moved slightly in front of you and Up-B anywhere from 20-60 frames after you initiated the taunt. Positions are restored 2 seconds after the Up-B comes out. Thanks to @SmashG0D for the awesome suggestion! ..."

Greg,He won't charge from a cable either
Greg,I haven't used it in months I think it's deadzo
Greg,That's a feels bad man
Greg,Keep trying though
Greg,Batteries and cables are weird
Greg,Try a different cable
Greg,dayum advanced settings are nice in ultimate
Greg,"stage hazards on/off, rage on off, a hilarious option for the stage to randomly change every minute"
Greg,F
Greg,Im just tryna ultimate
Greg,Just leave your Switch plugged in @Trapezoider
Greg,It just might look like it isn't charging when it really is
Greg,It just doesn't have enough battery to show that it is
Greg,Okay I will try that
Greg,How long does the download take?

Greg,No idea how long the download takes
Greg,I got the physical copy

Greg,Once I get online working you guys need to play vs me as well
Greg,You guys should set up a family plan together
Greg,My game has an hour left
Greg,So im gonna play a cs go or two
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,I gotta leave at 5 PST for gym and christmas stuff
Greg,You gonna be on before then?
Greg,Yeah I'll take a brake before then
Greg,Are you going to be back after though?
Greg,Yes
Greg,Like 9-10pm pst
Greg,
Greg,rip
Greg,90%
Greg,
Greg,Its happening boys
Greg,This intro song is weird
Greg,Are you kidding
Greg,That song is some fire
Greg,This bitches voice is annoying tho
Greg,D:
Greg,YO THERES VOICE ACTING IN CAMPAIGN
Greg,HYPE
Greg,Imagine doing the campaign to unlock characters
Greg,Isnt that what I have to do
Greg,nope
Greg,^
Greg,how do I get all the dudes?
Greg,"Play a game and do nothing but run and jump for 20 minutes then play games with 1 life and sd at the beginning. After every game, change the language."
Greg,this gets all characters in 2-2.5 hours
Greg,the fastest known method
Greg,Im just gonna play campaign on easy. That sounds really unfun
Greg,you will take way longer to unlock characters
Greg,See you next week when you unlock everyone
Greg,I dont need everyone
Greg,Just falcon
Greg,I think you will actually need to play story mode more than once
Greg,I think you get Falcon pretty early
Greg,Easy
Greg,I don't recommend playing the same character in multiple games
Greg,As in
Greg,Not in the story mode
Greg,Doing the method that Max described
Greg,There is a set order that you unlock the characters in doing that
Greg,Falcon plays completely different then he does in melee
Greg,This Ost is some fire
Greg,Okay I might do the thing
Greg,Story mode sux because theres ITEMS
Greg,LOL
Greg,If you insist on falcon I remember he is unlocked early
Greg,You still get to fight the characters by doing the other method
Greg,So it's not like you're just sitting there unlocking mans
Greg,You gotta beat them first
Greg,whats the first thing I gotta do
Greg,Run/ jump around for 20 minutes in a match
Greg,don't fight just move
Greg,plug in 2 controllers so the cpu doesn't attack you
Greg,set the rules to time 20 minutes
Greg,I dont have a second controller rn. Can I just not attack and try to live for 20 mins?
Greg,If I take dmg is it over?
Greg,You realise that a joy con is a controller
Greg,you can take damage
Greg,it is just annoying
Greg,Are you using a gamecube controller Andrew?
Greg,yes
Greg,Then use your joycons as a second controller
Greg,ez clapper
Greg,Already started the time
Greg,Not worth easy
Greg,wavelanding kinda sucks
Greg,max
Greg,I accidentally used the thing from kirby
Greg,I didnt damage the cpu
Greg,do i need to start over?

Greg,What do you mean you used the thing from kirby?
Greg,the three piece ship
Greg,I accidentally picked up all 3 and activated it
Greg,no dmg though
Greg,there is no need to start over
Greg,All you are doing is increasing an invisible steps taken and times jumped counter
Greg,As long as you continue to do those things everything is fine
Greg,"so just keep jumping
?"
Greg,literally it's totally fine
Greg,What do I do after game one
Greg,just move around and jump
Greg,just run and jump for 20 minutes
Greg,after the time runs out you will get to unlock ness
Greg,"then play 1-stock games and as soon as you get a character, fight em then change the game language and then play more 1-stock games until you get everyone"
Greg,then change the language and change the rules to 1 stock
Greg,in system settings or game settings?
Greg,game settings
Greg,do I kill the ai during sudden death or let myself die?
Greg,@Ultimate
Greg,Doesn't matter
Greg,so now just change language after every stock
Greg,Dope
Greg,Yup
Greg,can i just go back and forth on languages?
Greg,Yes
Greg,dope
Greg,can I interupt this process to play online
Greg,I have no idea
Greg,Or do I have to do the move thing again to start unlocking through language switcthing
Greg,just suck it up and play mad one stock games
Greg,It probably doesn't matter
Greg,I wanna play you before I have to go chris
Greg,Sauce up
Greg,Join up
Greg,@Ultimate
Greg,lets get a family plan

Greg,"Gotta study. I've got finals next week, but I'll let you know when I'm on a break and available."
Greg,wow it's really easy to get to elite smash
Greg,man tho there's some dicks
Greg,I just got stuck in a free for all and two of the people just flat out teamed
Greg,I almost 1v2'd them
Greg,and then they just waited for timeout
Greg,@Sak von Sak

Greg,Dude AZ is a dope ass state
Greg,@Ultimate

Greg,@Trapezoider
Greg,@Trapezoider
Greg,You are going to be waiting a long time lol
Greg,hello
Greg,ARE YOU GUYS HYPED FOR FINALS?
Greg,I'm hyped to be finishing school
Greg,but tests are stressful
Greg,"THATS WHY YOU GOTTA BE HYPE, YOU CANT BE STRESSED IF UR HYPED"
Greg,I fell asleep

Greg,Sauce up that lobby
Greg,I can't finna join voice
Greg,???
Greg,Why not?
Greg,@Mr. Airplane unblock me
Greg,Nope
Greg,Yes
Greg,nope
Greg,One final down three to go
Greg,Looks like I'm changing mains in ultimate
Greg,Why?
Greg,Corrin's moves can't hit short characters
Greg,they go right over their head
Greg,I'm going to be a Shulk player now
Greg,does shulk not suck ass in ultimate?
Greg,pog
Greg,I've seen people placing him high on tier lists
Greg,no im not saying you're wrong
Greg,im just like
Greg,pog
Greg,Max most of corrins best moves hit short stuff
Greg,Down tilt
Greg,Pin
Greg,Nair
Greg,Bite
Greg,Shulk just does all the things I liked about Corrin better
Greg,That wasn't the only reason for switching
Greg,"But just so you know I meant that it was hard to kill short characters because fsmash and bair, which seem to be the two moves that kill the earliest, either don't hit short characters or are hard to land."
Greg,Young link is still gay confirmed
Greg,He can't be gay though
Greg,He wears pink
Greg,and gay men don't wear pink
Greg,the math checks out
Greg,the numbers dont lie
Greg,@Ultimate Anyone down to play?
Greg,10 mins then yes
Greg,just join up when ready
Greg,hot damn kingston sm4sh put out a PR for the game's entire lifespan and I juuuuust barely slid in
Greg,"and it's really funny for me looking at everyone above me and being like ""yup, yup, yup, better than me, yup, yup"" for everyone ranked above me... except andybulb"
Greg,which I'm basing entirely off the one time I fought him and booped him with captain falcon after not going to tournaments for like a year
Greg,I'm sure he's probably done really well around that but oh well
Greg,I'm still pretty happy I made it on this despite barely only really playing for like a year
Greg,of the like four-ish years that there was a scene
Greg,How did a Little Mac get so high
Greg,Isn't Little Mac like really bad
Greg,we had the best little mac in ontario
Greg,second best in canada
Greg,he 2-0'd the guy who was (at the time) #3 in ontario a few times
Greg,"dude the whole PR up until #7 is low tier with the exception of DK who's like, mid tier"
Greg,"the character spread is like
mid, low, low, low, low, low, very high, high, high, top, high, mid/high, low, mid, mid/low, top, top, low, low, low"
Greg,we were a weird city
Greg,is kingston just all zacks?
Greg,@Ultimate
Greg,Yee
Greg,After how bad I got roasted by max and Ava I'm quitting ultimate
Greg,No pls
Greg,Ava 3 stocked me with Pikachu

Greg,and youre really bad
Greg,so its like a combo of the 2
Greg,oof
Greg,hahaha loser
Greg,"do it, you won't"
Greg,I already returned the game
Greg,Lame as fuck

Greg,:OmegaLUL:
Greg,Im better at all smash games than you
Greg,Imagine unironically thinking that
Greg,Imagine being so conceited you cant even recognize when you are about to get raped
Greg,I 3 stocked you multiple times
Greg,Can you guys hold off on the match till I get home so I can get in voice chat while you play and listen to the shit talk live?
Greg,Were we playing the same game 
Greg,Ok hold on though
Greg,I also want to be in voice for that
Greg,we gotta schedule this match
Greg,Somebody has to do WWE voice casting
Greg,but I thought he returned the game
Greg,You guys can spectate the match
Greg,You cant return games
Greg,it was a joke
Greg,You can't return games you bought from the eshop
Greg,lol
Greg,oh yeah spectating is a thing in this game
Greg,Also I want to play y'all at some point
Greg,HELL YEAH BOIS
Greg,since when is a low tier match between two bad players deserving of all this hype?
Greg,If the ping permits
Greg,It's not about the skill level it's about the shit talk
Greg,I'm going to be acquiring an ethernet adapter soon

Greg,I just call in sick when i need vacation because they dont allow me days off
Greg,is that allowed
Greg,My sick days come out of my vacation
Greg,Im an intern
Greg,So I work when I'm sick
Greg,They can do whatever the fuck they want
Greg,i hope u get fired Andrew

Greg,i bet you're still in debt
Greg,if anyone's getting aids its you lol
Greg,Also you've got a garbo internship if you get no vacation
Greg,Unless it's a 4-month one
Greg,How can you be in debt at 18
Greg,Im not
Greg,In which case that's just kinda how the cookie crumbles
Greg,I had to buy a car which brought me down to 0
Greg,I have 3200 in die bank. Im still poor but not in debt
Greg,oh well that was faster than you made it seem

Greg,"and a whole bunch of things were basically just like
""You thought it was an email from your coworker, but it was hooded hackerman""
and a graphic of some random dude in a shirt and tie would peel back and this dude would be behind it"
Greg,I mostly just get a kick out of the idea of a generic hacker as a dude in a black hoodie with bright red sunglasses
Greg,eating dinner at 6 is like the most standard time to eat dinner
Greg,3:30 and 4 are very early y

Greg,why would just lie like that
Greg,jesus dude
Greg,  OVERWATCH IS FUN
Greg,Overwatch is fun ❗
Greg,i think people who dont like it are just focussed too much on the wrong aspects of the game
Greg,that's subjective
Greg,i mean
Greg,not really
Greg,It completely is
Greg,that's actually the truest thing you could say about anything
Greg,if you dont like ow youre just a fat gay idiot
Greg,i mean you could go a moba and i could say well you don't enjoy it
Greg,because your focusing on the wrong aspects
Greg,i mean sure
Greg,but thats
Greg,pretty retarded to say
Greg,yeah maybe the fun aspects arent what you're interested in
Greg,so you just dont like the game
Greg,fusion like feeding
Greg,^

Greg,dva enables so much more interesting comps and playstyles
Greg,we just need more dva-like characters
Greg,"pharah, bastion, orisa, junkrat would all be broken if dva was banned, and these aren't fun or interesting characters to play when left unchecked"

Greg,Masteranime - Watch Anime Online Free
Greg,Masteranime - is an anime info database with a streaming option to watch anime in HD. Join the community to keep track of your watched anime and get to follow friends to see what they're watching.
Greg,Ooh thats a big spicy
Greg,Thank
Greg,"pretty much all of the anime streaming sites suck these days. They're all slow, low quality, and full of ads. You gotta torrent them yourself if you want quality."
Greg,I caNT ANYMORE
Greg,BECAUSE I USED TO PIRATE ALL THE TIME and now my ISP will rape me if I pirate again
Greg,
Greg,BIG sad
Greg,LOL
Greg,It was so dumb
Greg,I haven't had any issues with anime torrenting
Greg,I pirated BOTW to emulate
Greg,but that didnt matter because my MAJORAS MASK ROM was the final strike
Greg,lol stupid
Greg,How much do you have to pirate to get warned by your ISP?
Greg,but if anyone is curious the current anime torrent site I know of that works well is nyaa.si
Greg,A lot

Greg,https://clips.twitch.tv/ApatheticVenomousShieldPraiseIt
Greg,FRAN Playing Overwatch - Twitch Clips
Greg,Jeff Kaplan destroys players below Diamond - Clipped by akbierly
Greg,I really think that this argument is just false
Greg,metas in ow apply to basically every skill tier above like silver
Greg,like yeah other things can work in lower tiers
Greg,but if people just randomly decided to run goats they would still probably win
Greg,metas do not only rely on executing specific strategies but also the natural synergy between characters and the inherent strengths of characters
Greg,like dva is just really really good so you are more likely to win with a dva than without at basically every elo
Greg,yet the entire ow community seems to agree with Jeff here and uses this to argue about game balance like what
Greg,yea i can probably agree with you was Jeff just saying this relating to something else or what? @Mr. Airplane
Greg,he basically just said meta doesnt matter at plat and below
Greg,and then on reddit people were like 'yeah meta doesnt even really matter unless you're in like the top 5% of players'
Greg,Yeah that's retarded
Greg,"hmm i mean i think your both probably right but think it's more like gold and to a greater degree silver and below, because at that rank people just don't have any fundamentals so they rarely can make use of playing the character or the comp to their maximum potential. I do admit if a team were to play goats they would be more effective than just picking random hero's due to the innate usefulness of goats. Metas do apply but not because the players are good or can make use of the meta comp but more just due to the comp it self just being better than what they would pick normally that's probably my perspective"
Greg,bruh i literally just said that
Greg,read my wall of text
Greg,ok
Greg,smile
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,What's goats

Greg,daily vlogs    daily vlogs  
Greg,oops
Greg,????????????????
Greg,Dude what is going on
Greg,daily vlogs    daily vlogs  
Greg,
Greg,Yes
Greg,"What it mean when ya girl say """""
Greg,Oh
Greg,"kingston melee PR's out for this season, I can say with confidence I would have been on this if I was in kingston, based on the handul of tourneys I went to"
Greg,Where would you place yourself?
Greg,"I haven't played some of these people, but I'm say at least in the 7-9 range, possibly 6"
Greg,Also where would you place me?
Greg,Your region seems to lack good fox players.
Greg,"for the people I have played: 0-3 with dayman, 2-3 with momba, 0-1 with boo, 1-1 with deep in thot, 3-0 with sasquatch, 0-2 with dog, 1-0 with whom"
Greg,"I don't know honestly, I haven't gotten to play people all that much this season"
Greg,or you cause our connection's pretty bad
Greg,When you say 0-1 or 2-3 is that set count or game count?
Greg,sets
Greg,Are you going to bed soon or do you want to try some ultimate tonight?
Greg,D&D till bed
Greg,"but also I'm going to bed early no matter what, I'm starting to get a little sick so I want to make sure I get a good night's sleep"
Greg,"also, if it was in games, how would I be 0-1 or 1-0 or 1-1?"
Greg,Friendlies or a forfeit.
Greg,I guess forfeit could make sense
Greg,but I wouldn't count friendlies
Greg,I remember you saying something once about a guy reporting a score as 0 - -1
Greg,
Greg,Gottem
Greg,Nice job
Greg,Now I just gotta beat ceroas
Greg,fuck him up
Greg,We should do an Ultimate tourney when Kameron gets the game
Greg,Yes
Greg,@Ultimate
Greg,Probably with a character ban system like with melee
Greg,Also @Trapezoider don't be big gay
Greg,
Greg,Oh yeah he also has the game
Greg,Tournaments for this game will be cooler then our previous ones because we can host an arena for it and all the sets can be watched by the other players.
Greg,Im selling my switch mang
Greg,sorry
Greg,
Greg,unless zelda 2 gets announced
Greg,Just give it to Jed so he can play
Greg,
Greg,Or don't be big gay
Greg,I can imagine you selling your switch and then the very next day they announce the new Zelda game
Greg,YO 4TH
Greg,yeet
Greg,THATS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BUT DESERVED
Greg,@Trapezoider Don't sell yet
Greg,^
Greg,you gotta play more fam
Greg,mmm I was expecting like 5th
Greg,and had hopes of 4th
Greg,you thought maybe they would put you below jarek
Greg,yeah but that was fake I guess
Greg,I wasn't going off stats on that i was just worried he'd be biased in the decision time
Greg,but he wasn't
Greg,noice
Greg,yo I just did my math placement test and tested into math 250/260 thats good right?
Greg,what is math 250/260
Greg,cause its gonna depend based on the school
Greg,like what is the name
Greg,College algebra and trigonometry I guess?
Greg,Generally 2xx courses are second year so that's probably good
Greg,111 is college algebra at chemeketa
Greg,"It's GCU though, I imagine they have a different naming scheme? Unless you are secretly a GOD at math :D"
Greg,If it's the same as chemeketa that's calculus
Greg,And stats
Greg,I think they usually have similar naming systems
Greg,I thought so too but then I compared my community college to the state college I'm transferring to and everything was WACK
Greg,They literally had a whole website for translating which courses were equivelant between the schools
Greg,True
Greg,Maybe I lied
Greg,Idk the projected math course for me was 154 but the test said 250
Greg,Go on their website and find out which math that is
Greg,I'm curious
Greg,^
Greg,You might be a math God?
Greg,"Also Chris, thanks for help on math last year buddy. I used to hate it but now that I'm getting into the higher level stuff I'm really enjoying math!!!"
Greg,Applications of college algebra

Greg,Send the pic or you like dick
Greg,@Mr. Airplane
Greg,We can't help you unless we see
Greg,"@Mr. Airplane I wouldn't grow your hair so long that people would say that you have ""long hair"" but less short then I remember you having would be fine."
Greg,"Also, do you think you will get your package today?"

Greg,@Max what's ur gsp
Greg,"I have no idea, it changes as the relative gsp of everyone else changes. So since I have not played in a few days it is probably different from what it was before by hundreds of thousands. I am in elite smash though, so if you are not at least that you aren't caught up yet."
Greg,im just wondering
Greg,^
Greg,I'll go check in a few minutes
Greg,@The Rona wanna play or are you sleep

Greg,i have to get my wisdom teeth out over spring break

Greg,@The Rona
Greg,okay
Greg,
Greg,Okay thanks buddy
Greg,Oh didn't see that till now
Greg,"whoop whoop I don't think I""ve ever played any smash game as badly as I just played today"
Greg,that was an absolute shitshow
Greg,Rip
Greg,0-2?
Greg,yeah
Greg,against some garbage players
Greg,at least I've still got melee tomorrow
Greg,I really want to try ultimate competitively but I can't justify buying a switch
Greg,Just yoink Andrew's
Greg,He is selling it though
Greg,Exactly
Greg,So just yoink it
Greg,
Greg,andrew's selling his switch??
Greg,"Yeah, he's big gay"
Greg,wow what a retard
Greg,260 for 3 games and switch so issa good deal
Greg,And I did just get a $250 bonus but like I have school to pay for soon
Greg,buy it and resell the non ultimate games
Greg,Good idea
Greg,They are all digital though
Greg,oh
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Rip
Greg,Ok I don't know if this is good advice so take it with a grain of salt
Greg,Yeah you got school to pay for
Greg,But you also gotta treat yo self sometimes you feel
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Plus you got your entire school period to make money to pay for it
Greg,This is also true
Greg,"And in reality if everything works out the way I have planned I'll only actually be owing 3,000 out of pocket"
Greg,That ain't too too bad
Greg,Fingers crossed I can transfer to the Chipotle newar my school so I can get the reimbursement for the rest
Greg,Yeah it's hella good
Greg,Just don't come to me if this turns out to be a bad financial decision
Greg,
Greg,Also don't you have to pay for online monthly though?
Greg,Yeah but it's only $20 a year
Greg,Oh
Greg,We might also start a frostbite family plan
Greg,Plus if you do a family plan with the peeps in here it becomes a lot less
Greg,Ay nice
Greg,For example I'm only paying $8
Greg,@Ultimate Anyone?
Greg,No
Greg,Botw and Mario are physical
Greg,Oh shit
Greg,Only smash is digital
Greg,Yeah
Greg,mans finna resell

Greg,gimmie a bit
Greg,no clue why people think that ike wont be good forever
Greg,its easy to camp out ike
Greg,and if he mispaces nair it's an easy edgeguard
Greg,since his defensive game isnt that strong
Greg,he has to approach
Greg,"Well I did pretty bad in pools, but at least there's an amateur bracket"
Greg,On the flip side I won the rock paper scissors tournament
Greg,How many people were in that?

Greg,@Homies
Greg,anyone taken linera algebra?
Greg,Me
Greg,Okay
Greg,Vector Quantization
Greg,Im trying to collapse a series of audio channels into a single 1 dimension vector. My research keeps pointing me to a method called vector quantization
Greg,I have the basics of what a vector is from this video
Greg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs
Greg,"Vectors, what even are they? | Essence of linear algebra, chapter 1"
Greg,"I imagine many viewers are already familiar with vectors in some context, so this video is intended both as a quick review of vector terminology, as well as ..."
Greg,but as soon as things get funky i get CONFUSED
Greg,You got any insight?
Greg,When do things get funkyÉ
Greg,?
Greg,Also I'm not sure I know what vector quantization is
Greg,So my author talks about vector quantization then Markov Chains?
Greg,Are these linear algebra things even???
Greg,URRRGg
Greg,❤
Greg,"If it has to do with vectors, yes"
Greg,
Greg,Markov chain sounds like it's just a way of seeing sequences of possible events
Greg,Vector quantization is definitly a linear algebra concept
Greg,@Mr. Airplane Might know more?
Greg,Bird boi!!!
Greg,Come hither
Greg,I have scooby snacks 
Greg,Hmm
Greg,A quick Google search reveals that vector quantization is also a statistics concept
Greg,For creating a probability density function
Greg,Well that explains why im confused
Greg,I know nothing about probability density functions
Greg,Im only in my first stats class this term
Greg,You're definitly going to learn about them there
Greg,Probably more towards the end though
Greg,We just covered measures of variance / the normal distribution
Greg,True
Greg,Do probability density functions get pretty difficult
Greg,because so far the class is easy
Greg,Not really
Greg,Cool
Greg,
Greg,Math is so cool
Greg,Agreed
Greg,markov chains is indeed linear algebra
Greg,but i learned that like half a year ago i dont remember any of it lol

Greg,it just felt super generic and the second half was basically like 6 episodes of story and a fuckton of padding
Greg,Really :0
Greg,yeah
Greg,it's my very own Unpopular Anime Opinion
Greg,(TM)
Greg,Certainly
Greg,I actually agree with Zack
Greg,
Greg,The last 20 episodes are a lot of ACTION
Greg,But I still adore the show
Greg,I love the soundtrack
Greg,I've learned most of it on piano
Greg,"action can rarely hold something up on its own, and FMA has pretty uninspired choreography"
Greg,and there's just so much random stuff that felt like they threw it in without having much of a reason beyond padding the episode count
Greg,Except for this fight scene... I think even you can agree this is top notch

Greg,Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Alphonse vs. Pride and Kimblee
Greg,Alphonse is a total badass! Subscribe to our channel for all the latest updates & videos! Website: http://www.animelab.com Like us on Facebook: http://www.fa...
Greg,yeah that was a decent fight
Greg,but for a show with as much fighting as there was nothing particularly standout
Greg,like you look at most decent shows with a lot of fights and there'll always be at least a few crazy awesome fights and FMA just kinda doesn't
Greg,"you look at like, 
Fate/ - saber vs lancer, kiritsugu vs kirei, shirou vs archer, etc etc etc
KLK - every ryuko vs satsuki fight but especially the first, the second proper ryuko vs nui fight, the episode and a half boat fight, etc etc etc
MHA: All might vs nomu, deku vs todoroki, etc etc etc"
Greg,even some shows with basically zero fighting have really damn good fights every now and then
Greg,see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2QkKGrTd6Y
Greg,Tohru vs Kanna
Greg,Anime: Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon

Greg,"I love how twitch chat is memeing ""take this"""
Greg,?
Greg,Richter goes TAKE THIS when he brings out the jesus water
Greg,ah I see
Greg,Why would you play Richter over Simon?
Greg,there's a few matchups where it's better cause of some weird property of the jesus water
Greg,that is the literal only difference between the two
Greg,Yeah but isn't the difference Simon's holy water has the fire property and Richter's doesn't
Greg,I don't really know how it works honestly
Greg,I think it's better to have one in some matchups? not sure
Greg,Why would you not want to have the fire property
Greg,or it might be that it only matters in some matchups
Greg,"cause it's all the same hitboxes, they both do the thing where you're eating a whole bunch of hits if you're in it"
Greg,it's just literally the type of damage
Greg,which has some weird niche effects
Greg,ARMADA VS APOLOGY MAN
Greg,BATTLE OF THE TITANS
Greg,thats a pog dude

Greg,good question
Greg,one of my friends so badly wanted to go out to genesis for slap
Greg,but he's broke af
Greg,I'm still salty that slap city took stream priority over rivals
Greg,slap's actually pretty fun
Greg,yeah
Greg,"but like rivals isn't side event and it has a $13,000+ prizepool"
Greg,man's like top 2 fish in canada

Greg,"there's a solid sm4sh set going on right now (zackray, the guy who's been dominating japan) vs sonix (hella wifi warrior), and it's a great set but I'm really upset that both commentators are saying 'utilize' instead of 'use'"

Greg,the smash elo system is dumb
Greg,why do i gain more for beating somebody way lower rank than me than when i lose to somebody slightly higher rank
Greg,If you're low elo you gain hella fast
Greg,They want to separate the crappy players
Greg,I've got the opposite atm
Greg,I gain like nothing and lose a lot of I lose
Greg,maybe its cause im playing a new character
Greg,"For the first few matches of a new character, elo gains and losses are significantly increased."
Greg,"Legit I was playing yesterday, went like 7-3 with my only losses to people with higher elo and at least 4 wins over people with higher elo, and went from 3.680 million to 3.682"
Greg,It's weird

Greg,I guess no midterm for me today
Greg,I wonder how many people will actually make it out to the office
Greg,My prediction is no more than 4 of the usual 15
Greg,I think I'm gonna work from home today
Greg,As I'm sitting here on a perfectly nice day getting ready for school. Sigh
Greg,I would rather have your weather - I left my laptop charger at work so I'm gonna have to go out today to buy one
Greg,In the cold and rain and ice and hail
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,you can work from home?
Greg,Thats legit
Greg,ATI wont give remote access under any circumstances
Greg,Do you just RDP back to your desktop or does your laptop have all your projects?
Greg,"Laptop has all my stuff, and I can connect to everything else remotely"
Greg,Feels fucking bad. I still have classes
Greg,
Greg,"Slogged my way to school. Freezing half dead and ready to give in. Next thing you know, i see other people at home playing apex while they have no class"
Greg,feelsbadman
Greg,@Zain
Greg,A classic
Greg,"Pffft I'm in a video meeting atm to discuss how our depart did in the last quarter, and at one point they go ""the number of people using our services have skyrocketed! This is mostly because we broadened the definition of what qualifies as an active user, but it sure does make our numbers look good"""
Greg,LOLOL
Greg,Thats brilliant
Greg,I love corporate bullshitery like that
Greg,"In all fairness, even with our old metrics we did well, but also our new metrics made us look even better"
Greg,"@Master Memers boys chris raw just pronouced Yosemite ""Yah-Meh-Set"""
Greg,Chris wtf
Greg,"""yah-meh-set"""
Greg,
Greg,I know it's pronounced weird but that's just awful
Greg,"""Yo-ze-mite"""
Greg,"my life in japanese is ""yamen-nasai"""
Greg,
Greg,apex legends is a pretty fun battle royal
Greg,"Okay, I just watched a video on this game and it looks like a lot of fun"
Greg,I'll have to see how the shooting mechanics work though to know if I can enjoy it for more then a few days
Greg,@TheRainbowpixelz How does the game make money?
Greg,Do you start with all characters or do you have to buy them?
Greg,All but 2 characters are unlocked
Greg,All legends are sorta balanced.
Greg,I'd yet because  I've only played it for less than an hour
Greg,Ttk is mid to high. Guns feel super satisfying  to shoot
Greg,Game makes money by cosmetic  microtransactions. Since the game is ftp it gets a half pass
Greg,If all it sells are cosmetics that is amazing to me
Greg,As long as it aint loot boxes
Greg,Fingers crossed that ea doesn't pull an activision
Greg,It is loot boxes
Greg,As long as the majority of the gameplay content is not locked behind a paywall I'm game
Greg,smh
Greg,I do not care even a little how my character looks so I don't care how they do the cosmetics
Greg,^
Greg,I just want good and accessible gameplay
Greg,Have you played Titan fall?
Greg,no
Greg,OK then don't worry. The movement feels as crisp as cod
Greg,Never played cod either
Greg,Battlefield?
Greg,yeah
Greg,3
Greg,Battlefield but more responsive
Greg,No suppression. Some bullet drop and travel
Greg,noooooo
Greg,I hate that so much
Greg,It's nothing basically hits can but not  hitscan
Greg,I'll probably download it tomorrow
Greg,3 man squads only. Which is a dowbside
Greg,But fun game
Greg,Not sure of my pc can run it but I have a new graphics card that I have not installed yet so that should help if I can't.
Greg,Who does parties of 3
Greg,It runs on a modified source engine
Greg,yo
Greg,awesome
Greg,I get roughly 148 average fps
Greg,On low
Greg,I'm more worried about it functioning at all
Greg,How much fos you get in cs
Greg,I literally never check fps
Greg,I don't care as long as the game works without lag

Greg,Shooting feels terrible
Greg,bullet drop and travel time

Greg,and you're just adding to the bunch
Greg,no one cares about your annoying little crew
Greg,"fuck off ava you don't do shit in here, we kick the people after we are done playing with them unless they're chill and we want to keep playing games with them"
Greg,which I believe is the point of this server
Greg,I actually do talk in here semi-frequently thank you very much
Greg,and why even invite people if you literally plan to kick them
Greg,just make a group DM?? duh
Greg,"Damn just calm down boys and girls it's all good where just here to have some fun in the end, no need to start shit if you guys have some complaints just talk to me in DM instead of starting a flame war in chillin or don't do whatever you want lol."

Greg,But later tho
Greg,I am ready to refine my new main
Greg,I got family over
Greg,Who is your new main?
Greg,Young Link
Greg,Why?
Greg,"Because while I really like Cloud and saw great results with him against  people worse then me, you need to hit most of your limits with him in order to beat people that are as good as or better then you. Limit is not something you can really combo into, so it requires a read to hit. Getting reads like that has always been something that I've been bad at compared to everything else. Young Link does not require reads in the same way to do well and also has a really awesome combo game, good projectiles, and a better recovery."

Greg,"Its kind of unfortunate that the one part of our body that must always be kept exposed, our eyes, is so close to the one part of our bodies that must absolutely be protected, our brain."
Greg,it makes it harder to damage something that would cause us to lose some or all of our vision
Greg,cause there's fewer connecting parts that could be damaged
Greg,also faster reaction times
Greg,@Mr. Airplane  :-(
Greg,Did not think of the first one but I have considered the second point. I'm just not sure how much faster it would be.
Greg,"not much, which was why I brought it up as more of an afterthought"
Greg,but generally most of our sensory stuff is on our heads so it might be some of that
Greg,I dunno honestly
Greg,I'm guessing more of my original first point
Greg,@Jed
Greg,Brb
Greg,A lot of sensory stuff is also in the spinal cord
Greg,Most reflexes that we do come from it
Greg,@Jed
Greg,You here???
Greg,Can hear?
Greg,Also I do think that the speed is important enough
Greg,the spinal stuff is mostly for body senses something -> body reacts without mental processing stuff
Greg,Correct
Greg,so I guess that could work
Greg,as a counterpoint
Greg,hm
Greg,The brain still gets information though
Greg,just later yeah
Greg,Just to let it know what it's doing
Greg,For posture and stuff
Greg,so I think I'm gonna stick with the protecting the connecting bits theory

Greg,She's a Genius!
Greg,oh ew
Greg,that's lame
Greg,whoever wrote that is stupid
Greg,
Greg,sorry @Trapezoider @Jed i ended up having a long winded discussion with my friends about killing babies
Greg,Abortion?
Greg,I hope
Greg,no
Greg,killing living babies
Greg,You mean that New York law?
Greg,no
Greg,just in general
Greg,wait what did new york do
Greg,You can kill a newborn through neglect and it will be legally considered abortion
Greg,that's... not a good law
Greg,that's a pretty terrible law
Greg,Wait what the fuck
Greg,That is horrible
Greg,Who
Greg,The fuck
Greg,Thanks for at least being reasonable on this
Greg,aren't you not even allowed abortions past a certain point in the pregnancy
Greg,Voted for that
Greg,because it starts getting enough brain to be at least somewhat conscious
Greg,Different states can decide the point at which abortion is allowed
Greg,how in the fuck
Greg,"is a completely born, living baby"
Greg,What argument could there possibly be for this law???
Greg,not considered alive enough that that's a motherfucking problem
Greg,I have no idea how this passed
Greg,This is actually rediculous. Do you have a source for this?
Greg,let me find one real quick
Greg,Thanks crazy extremist left
Greg,nah our argument was more like theoretical
Greg,
Greg,Perhaps some of the things I heard were exaggerations but an abortion when there should be a delivery is still pretty sad
Greg,Not ruling out what I said as impossible though
Greg,Yeah q
Greg,based on that's it's just legal until birth
Greg,Still crazy either way
Greg,which is still a little sketchy
Greg,but not anywhere near as crazy
Greg,I think the after birth thing was a law currently being debated in Virginia based on what I read
Greg,I think that's actually discusting still
Greg,yeah
Greg,but in comparison it's not as bad
Greg,They are pretty equal
Greg,depends on the timeframe of letting neglect kill your baby counting as an abortion
Greg,It could be only seconds separating the time of death
Greg,"Even if you don't want it, just put it up for adoption"
Greg,"neglect would normally be like not feeding it, so I don't think it'd be seconds"
Greg,I'm pretty sure the neglect thing real or not was to be done only right after birth
Greg,seconds would be the doctor fucking up
Greg,"but yeah, still quite fucked up"
Greg,If you don't make a baby breath it can suffocate in seconds
Greg,I know someone who is mentally disabled because the doctor couldn't make him breath soon enough
Greg,"wouldn't have thought of that as neglect, but I dunno how the law looks at it"
Greg,I was thinking neglect being parental
Greg,anything else is just the doctor not being fast/good enough
Greg,"you do understand nobody carries the baby up to full term and then decides at the last second, the law is put in place for babies that will die soon after birth due to debilitating complications"
Greg,still a weird way of handling it
Greg,idk i think its perfectly fine
Greg,in the end its the parents choice
Greg,I guess the choice of the child doesn't matter then
Greg,"well i mean the ""child"" isnt actually like  a person yet"
Greg,so
Greg,they dont have one?
Greg,It's still a living breathing human being
Greg,Not everyone sees personhood as starting at the same time
Greg,it's not like they can make a choice at that point in life
Greg,i mean its not like you're offing a person who has lived a life and had experiences
Greg,and it's basically assisted suicide
Greg,which is a totally different argument
Greg,that kind of makes it worse
Greg,its like im deteling a game save that didnt have an data on it not like im deleteing a 100% completion run
Greg,You are denying them the choice
Greg,that I don't feel like having right now cause I'm real tired and should probably get to sleep and also I don't know my own stance on it
Greg,Would it be sadder to see a 5 year old die who has had no chance at life or a 100 year old with a life fully lived
Greg,"it's basically: yes you're denying them the choice, but also you're making the choice to doom them to a short life of misery"
Greg,both of which are shitty options
Greg,"regardless, I'm going to sleep"
Greg,goodnight
Greg,i mean both are about the same if you ask me?
Greg,i mena people die
Greg,shit ahppens
Greg,Yeah but not always purposefully
Greg,That's like saying it's alright if I murder my neighbour so who cares?
Greg,well an unborn baby =/= your neighbour
Greg,your neighbours is like actually a person
Greg,"""people die all the time"""
Greg,max said 5 year old vs 100 year old
Greg,idk where that argument was going but i was answering it
Greg,look i dont wanna argue about it cause nobody is gonna change their opinion about anything and itll just end in people being grumpy so ima drop it
Greg,I mean we don't really get grumpy from political debates here but I understand why you don't wanna argue
Greg,i cant tell tone is this like an offhanded roast or a genuine comment
Greg,Genuine comment
Greg,I don't know if everyone already knows or not but plup got into summit
Greg,You are denying those people the opportunity to exist
Greg,There is the potential for a life full of wonderful conscious experiences
Greg,@Sak von Sak
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL
Greg,pls join
Greg,
Greg,I'm
Greg,At work
Greg,O
Greg,Kay
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL come play big gai
Greg,In like 10 minutes
Greg,Jk more like 25
Greg,Fuck you
Greg,
Greg,jk tho
Greg,
Greg,since no one knows what time human becomes a human it's safest to assume that they are a human at conception so you can't abort anything if you could determine at what time a person becomes a person you wouldn't have this argument when we have something as valuable as life on the line i would rather be safe then sorry that's my position. @Max @Sak von Sak @Eric Working From Home @The Rona
Greg,I think abortion should be legal up to 2500 weeks
Greg,Yo that's 48 years
Greg,Yes
Greg,exactly
Greg,Also I agree with Zain
Greg,But in all seriousness I agree with Zain as well
Greg,"Considering that your brain is pretty much one of the first things that begins development, I would argue you ""become a person"" pretty early on"
Greg,i mean even if you are arguing that it is a person and not an anomaly (im probably using that word wrong) the value of a life isnt that high imo
Greg,"An anomaly would be something that isn't standard, so I don't really know what you mean by that?"
Greg,A fetus is a pretty normal thing
Greg,uhh
Greg,hello boss?
Greg,considering a zygote contains all the information necessary for a complete human to form I think that is when you are human
Greg,If there was a completely painless and cost free way to remove a zygote from the womb and grow it externally without harming the mother I think there becomes no moral arguement for abortion
Greg,change my mind
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL
Greg,@Bitmin
Greg,are you guys still here?
Greg,I got yoted?
Greg,i mean what would even be the point of going to those lengths to create a person
Greg,That's what plan B does right?
Greg,Because it is better to live than to never have the chance to exist
Greg,there are so many people in the world and we are so insignificant that to think we actually matter is narcissistic and delusional
Greg,And creating more concious minds is the moral imperative
Greg,like if i died tomorrow would it matter
Greg,no
Greg,Yes it would
Greg,Because you matter
Greg,i care about u dober
Greg,thats the poiont in tryna make
Greg,nobody matters
Greg,u matter to me
Greg,But that's not true
Greg,^
Greg,Thats not true
Greg,Every life matters. Conciousness is the only thing that matters. Maybe the universe doesnt assign us any meaning at birth
Greg,"If you have the mindset that you don't matter, then you probably won't ever do anything that matters. But if you live your life with the mindset of doing something that matters and had an impact somewhere, you probably will achieve that to some scale"
Greg,But it could be said that humans and more generally conscious creatures are the ONLY thing that matters
Greg,"i'm all for killing babies, but i don't like letting women have a choice"
Greg,^^

Greg,Pinned a message.
Greg,so in DnD spiders have a strength of 2
Greg,meaning they can life 30 pounds (reduced to 15 due to their size)
Greg,a single spider can carry 15 pounds
Greg,imagine you wake up in the night and see a spiuder yoinking your newborn
Greg,Crawls into your womb and just carries them out
Greg,you have made me feel a feeling i never want to feel again

Greg,owl
Greg,"on friday, we had an office lunch thing where our manager took us all out for lunch, I ended up sitting next to the manager and one of the full timers and got to listen to them spend the entire lunch talking about weed"
Greg,Is weed legal where you live?
Greg,yeah
Greg,its legal in all of canada
Greg,it's legal canada-wide
Greg,but you need a license to sell it and only a tiiiiiiny handful of places have gotten some yet
Greg,so most available weed is still illegal
Greg,well illegal to sell not illegal to be in possesion of right?
Greg,yeah
Greg,you can also grow your own
Greg,how many plants?
Greg,but only up to a maximum of like 4 plants or something
Greg,I think in Oregon its 5
Greg,Why would there be a plant restriction?
Greg,my family almost ended up growing weed for one of my mum's friends who is basically incapable of not killing houseplants
Greg,"it's basically to make it so you can't grow and sell easily, you have enough for a household who are all using but not really enough to sell it"
Greg,or at least I think that's why
Greg,plant restriction so the entire population of canada doesnt get addicted
Greg,but 5 plants if a fuck ton lmao
Greg,weed's not addictive tho
Greg,^
Greg,i know but
Greg,How big is a weed plant?
Greg,sketchy dealers will sometimes lace it with addictive stuff but if you grow your own it's just weed
Greg,"I honestly have no idea, but I think they grow pretty low to the ground so I'd assume not big"
Greg,"they're closer to, y'know, weeds than regular plants"
Greg,i thought the idea is that individuals mass growing weed doesnt screw with the price
Greg,that makes more sense honestly
Greg,I mean oregon has too much weed now lmao
Greg,oregon has to grow it for the other states 
Greg,You are allowed to plants per person over 18 in a household
Greg,oh damn not bad
Greg,we might have been growing 6-8 plants then
Greg,Oh the age is probably 18 to smoke there huh?
Greg,"I would have thought 19, same as drinking age, but I dunno"
Greg,Eief way still better than 21
Greg,You can't even vape or smoke tobacco products till 21 in Oregon now

I've been sleeping with no clothes on for the passed few nights because it feels better and my grandpa doesn't come into my room much, so he wouldn't know. But this morning I accidentally slept in so grandpa came in to wake me up. I had morning wood (an erection in the morning that is caused in your sleep) and I had kicked the covers off during the night so I was laying there naked, with a hard-on (how embaressing!!). Grandpa quickly went out of the room and we weren't talking because it was awkward. Then later on today I was wanking off in the bathroom (which doesn't have a lock) when I thought my grandpa was outside. He walked in just as I was ejaculating and groaning with . One day doesn't get much more embaressing than that!! How unlucky. My grandpa and I haven't talked for seven hours now. What should I say to him?"

Greg,Played a bunch already today sorry. I played some Ike as a part of my journey to try all the top tiers and also went on a huge winning streak with puff (who ended up higher GSP than Ike lol).
Greg,pfft nice
Greg,Can confirm that puff dittos are still really boring
Greg,I got one
Greg,@Sak von Sak hell yeah buddy
Greg,Then we should do gen 7
Greg,still gotta finish gen 7
Greg,but yeah
Greg,You should do that
Greg,Then later we can do gen 8
Greg,
Greg,What gen is the newest one?
Greg,They announced 8 today
Greg,See the pokemon I posted earlier today
Greg,Those starters are super ugly
Greg,they're not stellar
Greg,TAHNK YOU
Greg,I kinda like the water one tho
Greg,Nobody here likes my boy Grookey 
Greg,water and fire are aight but grookey is so bad it drags htem down with it
Greg,he's second best but not really particularly notable
Greg,fingers crossed for kameron liking the fire one and then if we do gen 8 we all get the starter we want
Greg,He's literally a baby monkey
Greg,So cute
Greg,I the the fire one too
Greg,I think he is the best of the three but still kinda bad

Greg,Report: Amazon will pay $0 in federal taxes this year
Greg,"Amazon won't pay a cent in federal taxes this year, according to a report by a watchdog group.  The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy(ITEP) reports that Amazon, in fact, is getting a $129 million rebate, meaning they will effectively pay a negative one percent tax rate."
Greg,Yikes
Greg,Big business privilege
Greg,Have not read a ton on this but I think they helped write the tax laws that made this possible
Greg,Why do we let this happen
Greg,Cause we don't want them moving to a different country and losing jobs
Greg,But it's still really not a good way to go about it
Greg,i mean it's free speech dude the speech that says heres 10 million dollars lets write some laws deff not a bribe btw
Greg,lol
Greg,Lol
Greg,Not.only are they paying 0 taxes

Greg,My chances of proving myself just flat out don't exist
Greg,Cause I'm not good enough to beat top 20 people without playibg really well and getting a decent helping of luck and they're the only people I fucking play

Greg,@Homies @Eric Working From Home Just found out that tabletop simulator has a bunch of full magic the gathering sets on the workshop and I want to play the game again. Feel free to @ me if anyone wants to play.
Greg,That'd be fun we could play like with the battledecks or have a draft/commander night
Greg,im not huge on draft tho
Greg,not a fan of commander but I would be down for draft or sealed
Greg,haha
Greg,oh lol
Greg,We could do 6 packs from an old set
Greg,if people play draft ill play dont get me wrong
Greg,prerelease style
Greg,ah okay
Greg,never been to a prerelease
Greg,they are fun
Greg,I went to the magic origins one
Greg,i liked that set
Greg,I think that this format would be best because I doubt we will get enough for draft.
Greg,Prerelease format works with any player count
Greg,fair
Greg,We could pick an old classic set like Innistrad or Zendikar
Greg,innistrad best plane with best planeswalker as its guardian dont @ me
Greg,My favorite set personally was Khans of Tarkir
Greg,oh im jsut ta;lking lore

Greg,Will you have mega free time tomorrow?
Greg,I'll have a computer then hopefully
Greg,yes
Greg,Not sure if you are interested but I would be super down to play some Magic the gathering on tabletop
Greg,Any amount would work for sealed but we need at least 6 for a proper draft
Greg,I don't think playing a constructed format would be a good idea
Greg,The way magic works on tabletop would make it complicated and inconvenient
Greg,@Zain Do you know how to play magic or would you be learning?
Greg,I would play sealed or draft
Greg,@deleted-role anyone down?
Greg,"@Homies We are playing magic the gathering on tabletop simulator tomorrow. Feel free to come and join whether you have played before or are new to the game as anyone who has played can teach you before we start. For those who know what this means, we will be playing either sealed or draft as constructed is inconvenient to play on tabletop."
Greg,why dont we just play rn
Greg,I guess I could try on my laptop
Greg,he has his laptop
Greg,tabletop sim is not too resource intensive
Greg,which is better than his pc anyways
Greg,We could at least teach Zain tonight
Greg,not sure if everyone would want to play on this short notice
Greg,@Zain interested?

Greg,I think because his name got leaked.
Greg,I mean he has already told people in this discord
Greg,Now everyone knows
Greg,Wait what is it
Greg,^
Greg,Zade

Greg,@Mr. Airplane of course you wanna play rivals now that I'm not at home
Greg,I could play keyboard kragg on shitty wifi though 
Greg,JED
Greg,FOCUS ON YOUR PAPER
Greg,!!!!
Greg,Nah I'm about to finish my project
Greg,Then the paper
Greg,I'm also writing a paper
Greg,The alternative energy paper
Greg,"After researching it, I'm not really sure why people like to hype up wind and solar, as they seem like the two worst options."
Greg,Nuclear >
Greg,Solar efficiency has a moores law and will be superior in the coming years
Greg,Because they are renewable
Greg,Sure they aren't very good
Greg,But they are effective in the long run
Greg,I'm saying that there are better renewables
Greg,Also solar technology will only improve
Greg,the basic idea is that it's a one-time cost you can stick pretty much wherever
Greg,hydroelectric is probably best but you can only stick it in certain places
Greg,and become cheaper while still harnessing energy at a higher efficiency
Greg,you can just shove solar panels on a roof and get a decent amount of energy
Greg,Utilities companies will never accept that
Greg,They will lose a lot of revenue
Greg,they can't entirely stop you as far as I know
Greg,They can lobby against it
Greg,I wrote another paper on that
Greg,even on personal property and stuff?
Greg,damn that's dumb
Greg,If you have solar pannels you have to sell the energy back to the grid
Greg,"Or if you use the power yourself, and don't use the grid"
Greg,You have to pay for the power that you would have used
Greg,well
Greg,that's dumb
Greg,indeed
Greg,I am fairely sure that is how it currently works atleast in Ontario
Greg,Hooray for lobbying
Greg,"I know at my house we just pay for an alternate provider who gets their stuff from renewable sources, which is an option but I don't think they generate enough total energy to supply a particularly large number of people"
Greg,"basically we just take energy and they pump that much more into the grid (and pay a bit extra, so we also pay a bit extra)"
Greg,lol marss camera tricked himself
Greg,To me it looked like he did neutral B instead of down B

Boomer: lv48 Wailord (died to a crit)
Snek: lv46 Dragonite (got ice beam'd)
(also brought 3 garbo pokemon)

Progress: Agatha three mons down"
Greg,Will Chris finally win one?
Greg,almost certainly
Greg,we introduced some new rules for elite four to prevent stalling and it kinda depends on how far kameron makes it
Greg,aight chris just won
Greg,Why would you ever want to stall in a race?
Greg,"if everyone else loses, winning strat is to just grind till you're overleveled and then make it further"
Greg,so we changed the rules so the first person to reach the elite four doesn't have to make it as far to win

Greg,seems mega stupid
Greg,Yeah but you said it took like 20 gb per hour or something crazy right?
Greg,Supposedly
Greg,I didn't look too deep into it
Greg,But its supposed to stream the game from the cloud
Greg,Which I think means it runs the game from the cloud
Greg,Yeah
Greg,SO I think the  idea is you dont need a device to process it you can just play from anything that can stream it
Greg,or rather you dont need a good device
Greg,Yeah
Greg,So I found a little more

Greg,everytime he gets a haircut it looks like its only cut back by 1cm
Greg,kameron likes his hair long because he loses 1 cm of pingo for every 1 cm of hair
Greg,^
Greg,its a 1:1 hair to pingo reverse relationship
Greg,"f(p) = p * -h
Where f(p) is a function of the relationship between
p (pingo length)"
Greg,h (hair length)

Greg,The open A.I bot that could produce extremely realistic written text did a debut on reddit
Greg,It would respond to everyones comment with a paragraph of text
Greg,"Heres what it said to me saying 
""In the beginning man made memes."""
Greg,"OUTPUT:
The internet was meant to let us enjoy those memes because we saw them. In their mind man made memes was as much an expression of man's self to be seen as any other. This is a sad state of affairs and we see it again and again in the work of art.When a new art forms is created men take what they need to reproduce the original. They put in what they can, this will bring the art back, and this will lead to new art forms. This works like ""We need to love something and enjoy it"" but it is an extension of the original. It is the same with art.> 
This process creates new forms of artistic expression. This is what the ""songs of history"" are all about. It creates new forms of expression. I would much like to hear about these great works that are being created through this process. They are all in this world. People like you that love art will listen to the work of these artists and create a great work of work. I would like to hear about some of these great works through your community. Here's what you can do to help. Take a look. A man made meme> 
This is how the creator of these works came to get his name. This is an interesting thing. If you don't know this guy, the Internet is really the most amazing thing ever to happen to the internet. People have created a new art form to be reproduced in and around our public spaces. Now all we see is this guy being made a poster and that's it.> 
You know this meme is great and you just want to help a few people. Here are some links to help you out. This is why we are so hard at work to create the memes we deserve. If you want to know more on this and more great works about this we're here to help.> 
The Art of Making> 
And this is a must get for everyone at work. If you are one of the lucky few you will get a copy of The Art of Making. We've put together this guide to help you make sure everyone has a copy of The Art of Making. We hope it helps you too!

Greg,I found a no kap in the wild
Greg,safe now
Greg,?
Greg,spoilery things in another channel
Greg,@Neurotic you a bitch
Greg,jk u a nice guy
Greg,i never understand these sentiments
Greg,it seems like every person on reddit agrees with and spouts this garbage
Greg,Yeah
Greg,This isn't even true
Greg,like yeah you CAN do well with low tiers
Greg,People be dumb
Greg,but it PROBABLY WONT BE FUN
Greg,Falco laser spam is arguably better at low level for example
Greg,YOUR CHARACTER LITERALLY HAS LESS OPTIONS
Greg,= LESS FUN
Greg,also most people probably consider winning kinda fun
Greg,the second part of this post just isn't even true
Greg,"most people can identify what makes a character good pretty easily, even people who don't understand the game"
Greg,"ie chrom kills early and is fast, ylink has projectiles"
Greg,But Kirby cant die 4Head
Greg,I built a machine learning pipeline that can predict with 70% accuracy how many defects one of the parts we are going to produce will have
Greg,Feelsgoodman
Greg,Whats everyone up to these days>
Greg,?
Greg, 
Greg,Wrote a lab report on the BMR of mice
Greg,We is BMR?
Greg,Big Mega Roast?
Greg,Basal metabolic rate
Greg,What were the conclusions of your lab results?
Greg,Basically how much energy your body needs to run at rest
Greg,A mouse uses about 7.625cal/hr/g
Greg,So 7.625 calories per hour
Greg,per gram of body weight it has
Greg,How does one calculate these metabolic rates?
Greg,In laymans terms please
Greg,❤
Greg,"I'll tell you later, I'm in my lab now"
Greg,@here how do i get rid of this bullshit in the corner
Greg,No idea it seems like a new 'feature'
Greg,hover over it
Greg,and there should be an X
Greg,in the corner
Greg,THERES NO X
Greg,then you lost gg
Greg,guess im just gay
Greg,problem solved guys
Greg,its a bug
Greg,not a feature lol
Greg,Too bad you have the gay now
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL ive got that shit too
Greg,howd you fix
Greg,prob just restart ?
Greg,i didnt fix it
Greg,waiting on discord to fix it
Greg,Results from survey
Greg,n = 91 (so far)
Greg,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot surgeon to perform a critical surgery. (Heart Transplant, Gastric Bypass, Spinal Poliomyelitis Surgery, Surgical Ventricular Restoration ETC...)"
Greg,
Greg,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot to perform basic Nursing duties (pre-post operational care, taking: pulses, temperatures, blood pressures, monitoring and administering medication and intravenous infusions)"
Greg,
Greg,Do you feel an Artificially Intelligent Robot could provide emotional support during recovery?
Greg,
Greg,Do you think a ban should be placed on Artificially Intelligent Robots preventing them from entering the healthcare workforce to prevent medical professionals from being ousted from their jobs?
Greg,
Greg,Would you trust the diagnosis of an Artificially Intelligent Doctor?
Greg,
Greg,Looks like I was in the minority for those last three
Greg,It appears the general consensus (If this sample is representative at all) is that a reasonable portion of people are comfortable with SOME form of A.I assistance in healthcare
Greg,same
Greg,for what chrius said
Greg,@Trapezoider I think a resonable interpretation of this data would be if A.I assistance in healthcare was proven to be a benifit based upon evidence people would be comfortable in using it on themselves that's why a mojarity would say maybe i think
Greg,Yeah
Greg,What
Greg,There isn't really enough data on this for people to have informed opinions
Greg,"For me, as someone who knows how far the academic research has advanced, I can see how application of A.I is superior in many different medical domains  when compared to the best human Doctors. For the layman however, they don't have knowledge of the ground breaking developments  to answer these questions knowledgeably"
Greg,yea i think the reason there are so many maybes is because either the data is not there or people don't know enough about the data
Greg,yea exactly
Greg,that's why i think if people knew what maybe you did there would a lot more yes's rather then all the maybes but i could deff be reading a lot more into the data then i should be
Greg,I think the sample size is too  small to be too confident in our answer
Greg,"As far as sample sizes go, this is pretty good"
Greg,i mean this is deff not a good representation of the population my dude at least not this server
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Im gonna see if I can send it to people at work
Greg,I could easily get 800 responses from this plant alone
Greg,I think of all the questions a consensus should be reached about the first question. Human Surgeons make mistakes and some of those mistakes are sometimes fatal. It would be universally better to have ai or nano bots or whatever performing that part of the medical process. Thats the part people fuck up the most on lol\
Greg,Agreed
Greg,Now the A.I community needs to figure out how to explain to the public the work they are doing
Greg,It should be simple lol guess not
Greg,It's not simple to explain this stuff in a way that people trust
Greg,unfortunately the reason for that is cause generally people are uneducated on the subject
Greg,Even though I'm demonstrating empirically superior analytics at my Internship (compared to our business analyst team) I am encountering strong opposition to Machine Learning
Greg,Precisely
Greg,It's gonna take a lot of time to shift the zeitgeist on this issue
Greg,Thanks Alot Stephen Hawking scared everybody in the 90s
Greg,@Trapezoider stop using big words u stupid idiot
Greg,yeah
Greg,ya dumb
Greg,^
Greg,but like unironically using words like that makes you sound like you carry around a pocket thesaurus
Greg,He does
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,Its some fucking r/iamverysmart shit
Greg,I think that was an appropriate use of the word for the actually meaning that would not have  a good substitute to get his point across
Greg,"""zeitgeist"""
Greg,how bout popular opinion
Greg,actually zeitgeist does not even make sense in that context
Greg,because it refers to something from the past
Greg,and this is the present
Greg,so popular opinion actually makes way more sense
Greg,^
Greg,
Greg,It doesnt only apply to the past lol
Greg,Did you read the definition at allÉ
Greg,?
Greg,well we don't know what the zeitgeist of the current time is until the current time is over so it kinda does
Greg,I cant read
Greg,
Greg,"also the word is usually used to refer to historic timeframes, example ""the 60s"""
Greg,Reading hurt my pee pee
Greg,"""demonstrating empirically superior analytics"""
Greg,this just word salad
Greg,I dont wanna get hung up on semantics but and im not saying the way he said things was good or bad but i think it is fine to use big words to describe specifics if it makes sense
Greg,im just saying that if you talk that way dumb people are gonna think you're smart and smart people will probably think you're dumb
Greg,Fair
Greg,"I just hate the negaive look on ""big words"" use them if you can and they make sense"
Greg,i would change that to use them if you need to for it to make sense
Greg,'big words' typically will have very specific use cases
Greg,Or just don't overuse them in everyday speech
Greg,using them whenever you can will make your speech more confusing
Greg,Like an essay or a paper etc.
Greg,even then
Greg,But it real life its like trying to up the word count
Greg,you shouldn't use big words in a essay just to sound smart
Greg,you should use them if they're meaning aligns with the message you are trying to convey
Greg,In an essay big words can be used effectively to describe the 'seriousness' of the situation
Greg,eh
Greg,But again there's a limit to that
Greg,i dunno about that
Greg,Just don't overdo it
Greg,Hey Kameron
Greg,How about you eat cock
Greg,there is a difference between big words and formal language
Greg,Zeitgeist was the appropriate word
Greg,Literally false
Greg,it clearly wasn't
Greg,
Greg,Read it and weep
Greg,It clearly was
Greg,"""Current believes and ideas of the time"""
Greg,of the time
Greg,i.e.
Greg,The past
Greg,2010's is a time period
Greg,I am conducting this survey now to see how things evolve over time
Greg,"yeah but its not even a ""defining spirit or mood"""
Greg,10 years from now the zeitgeist around A.I and A.I in healthcare will be entirely different
Greg,fear of ai is not a defining spirit of the 2010s
Greg,Yeah but we as people in the present have a poor understanding of the majority consensus on topics
Greg,It is in my circles
Greg,Fear of A.I is one of the most discussed topics of the people I work and hangout with
Greg,My intellectual life is dominated by this topic
Greg,Man andrew you're really smart
Greg,Man Kameron you're a really big asshole
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,Ill make that asshole gape a little wider
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,"But Kameron, what I was saying about big words in an essay was essentially the idea you said"
Greg,"I'm sorry if you feel I'm tossing together a word salad, but this is the world I live in. Bullshit meetings and emails and fucking retarded standardization of everything"
Greg,I just didn't know how to express it
Greg,hence the quotations around the word seriousness
Greg,yeah
Greg,Everyone at work ACTUALLY emails and talks like that
Greg,Andrew have you heard of the theory of great filters as connected to the Fermi Paradox?
Greg,Yes I have
Greg,I think it is entirely likely that surviving AI could be the final filter that nothing passes
Greg,Maybe A.I is the bottleneck that prevents most civilizations from becoming intergalatic
Greg,This is why I'm entering the field. I want to ensure we build safe A.I and don't destroy everything we care about
Greg,I think that's the idea
Greg,We develop alternate realities
Greg,That we live in entirely
Greg,i.e. they are so advanced that we think it's reality
Greg,eg. the Matrix
Greg,That we kind of just forget about progression and stuff
Greg,Who knows where all this is going
Greg,All bets are off the table
Greg,"Go read Perfect State by Brandon Sanderson, it's basically that idea"
Greg,Sorry let me phrase that in words kameron will like
Greg,Also its only like 60 pages
Greg,I think that finding and increasing the genetic basis for IQ in humans would be a far safer approach to increase our scientific progress then creating AI.
Greg,all gambling activities have after careful consideration been labeled not available as actionable items in the workplace environment
Greg,?????????????????????????????
Greg,That's what I call a fucking word salad
Greg,much better
Greg,holy shit
Greg,@Max
Greg,I disagree
Greg,It's an interesting take on how a matrix-like system could work in a way beneficial to the happiness of mankind but at the cost of other stuff and all around its a solid story
Greg,"Andrew, what is your view on transhumanism?"
Greg,I don't think you can get enough of an increase in intelligence from using CRISPR to edit genes. Brains are about as big as they can be due to birth canal size. I think the way to go is high bandwidth brain interfaces. A third neo-cortex in the words of Kurzweil
Greg,"I think transhumanism is dogmatically adhered to too much, especially by silicon valley type people. Transhumanism is a good goal to aim for, but with some asteriks* to ensure we don't accidentally destroy ourselves (genetically engineering superhumans---->super bug that wipes out everyone etc..)"
Greg,I'm off lunch break boys. Have a nice day. Thank you for keeping my mind busy with fun discussions ❤
Greg,@Mr. Airplane @The Rona  I think that when ever your trying to communicate with people it's probably more importent that the people you're communicating with understand the message you want to convey over saying it as efficetly as possible. If we work off this premise then the best way to communicate is to use words that almost everyone will understand thus making your message hopefully easier to understand for the people your communicating with agreed?
Greg,zain ur late we already finished this discussion

Greg,I love this emo man
Greg,wow the voices in this game are actually obnoxious
Greg,"these are probably the worst characters, voice-wise"
Greg,or maybe I'm just used to being annoyed at them cause I play both of them
Greg,"Whenever I play ultimate with Ava or with her in the room, she always comments on how annoying Ike is because he makes so many war cry type noises."
Greg,ike's voice is way better than this
Greg,that is true
Greg,^
Greg,i think if I had to listen to those voices for 5 minutes i would blow my brains out
Greg,they're not that bad
Greg,they're like the two worst anime voice archetypes
Greg,true
Greg,extremely squeaky little girl and edgy man child
Greg,@Homies come chill
Greg,there was some debate in the queen's fgc discord over who the edgiest character in the game is between that guy and this dude:

Greg,And I watched it for like 5 seconds
Greg,@The Rona when u get back
Greg,those are some AWESomE VoicCE ACtTORES

Greg,2 hours of sleep over the last 36 hours. Check in isn't till 4 so we are derping around
Greg,"Should we go to universal studios, SeaWorld,  or disneyworld"
Greg,??
Greg,Universal studios is also pretty sick
Greg,They got some nice rides
Greg,Universal is the best of those three options
Greg,"You gotta go to adventure Island though, that's where the better rides are (it's a part of Universal studios)"
Greg,Also it's the one with Hogwarts
Greg,^
Greg,adventure island is really cool
Greg,the main park is more movie focussed while adventure island is more ride focussed
Greg,^
Greg,but I agree its probably the best of the three
Greg,honestly disney is kinda boring and its usually mad crowded
Greg,If you like roller coasters
Greg,Adventure Island has probably one of my favourites
Greg,in the Hulk ride

Greg,I just saw a shiniqua raw drink whipped cream
Greg,I've done it
Greg,it's really good
Greg,?
Greg,eaten raw whipped cream
Greg,What is the difference between that and regular whipped cream?
Greg,it hasnt been cooked
Greg,"I'm pretty sure he either means
a) non-whipped cream that you're supposed to whip, or
b) just straight whipped cream without putting it on anything"
Greg,
Greg,I have done both of these things
Greg,the first was honestly much less exciting than the second
Greg,i think @Trapezoider was referring to whipping cream which is hella gross to drink and is not the same as whipped cream
Greg,whipping cream > raw buttermilk
Greg,especially if you're not expecting the buttermilk
Greg,So
Greg,Did you drink whipping cream
Greg,just a bit
Greg,or just whipped cream by itself
Greg,stop drinking things alone that are supposed to be ingredients in other things
Greg,I have done some terrifying things with whipped cream
Greg,
Greg,"in a relatively normal, food-related way"
Greg,
Greg,fuck y'all
Greg,
Greg,Not when there's whipped cream involved

Greg,both
Greg,How do you know?
Greg,plus perfect shielding projectiles got better
Greg,"Zack should be happy, Mewtwo is probably the most buffed character of the patch."

Greg,come into voice
Greg,"so yesterday at work I was talking about danganronpa with one of the other interns, and I tell him that I've been taking a bit of a break from danganronpa 3 cause I'm pretty sure at least one of my favourite characters is gonna die and I don't feel like going through that right now, he asks me who my favourite characters are, I tell him my two favourites, and on the second one he literally goes

""Oh I remember when he dies!""

I'm now playing again and man just died."
Greg,i bored
Greg,I'm down to do stuff once I'm through this bit of danganronpa
Greg,that'll probably be at least an hour though
Greg,You favorites always die
Greg,"yes, they sure do"
Greg,I still have one left
Greg,and they are extremely suspicious
Greg,This is why you don't tell people who your favorite characters are
Greg,If your favorite doesnt die then you cant pick good characters to favorite
Greg,Sylki that's so bm of that guy what the heck !! So much for a spoiler alert
Greg,yeah kinda
Greg,"it totally is, I'd be mad"
Greg,oh I am
Greg,"but also that whole chunk of the game I played today was really, really good"
Greg,so I'm less upset than I was before just cause it put me in a better mood
Greg,even though one of my favourite characters died
Greg,ooh that's a nice way to look at it
Greg,also I would have been more upset if the character hadn't been raising death flags left and right for 90% of the game
Greg,I just kinda assumed he wasn't gonna make it and honestly I'm shocked he survived this long
Greg,haha just don't get attached to characters like that
Greg,you can't just not get attatched to characters
Greg,danganronpa's good at what it does
Greg,no I'm joking I feel ya
Greg,i should probably play that at some point
Greg,do eeeet

Greg,Be there in a minute
Greg,"@Max 
1) I should just run back instead of shielding all the time, running backwards is really good
2) I need to focus more on not getting hit
3) I think when I am at mid percents I go  for risks thinking I won't die but characters in this game can kill at like 0 so I should stop doing that"
Greg,All solid points
Greg,@Ultimate anyone down?
Greg,I guess I'll play some more
Greg,"I'm down, lemme run to the bathroom first tho"

Greg,didnt win a single game
Greg,and the people i played weren't that great
Greg,my first set I brainlessly approached bowser and got up b'd outta shield for like 5 stocks straight
Greg,once I stopped being dumb it was too late
Greg,then I played a villager
Greg,my palu got 3 stocked cause I dunno what to do vs fair/bair

Greg,thats whats weird
Greg,ok you need loss-of-focus-proof tourney nerves
Greg,try listening to music?

Greg,theres just no friendlies setups at our fests
Greg,so i get cold
Greg,"find something that suits the mood you're looking for - a lot of people go for intense stuff to hype themselves up, I go for more chill stuff to keep myself from getting titled or overly aggressive, it kinda depends what you're looking for"
Greg,also are there setups pre-bracket?
Greg,we had very few setups today 
Greg,I just gotta grind dude

Greg,I feel your pain Brother
Greg,Just become a teacher
Greg,Factz
Greg,Summer for the rest of your life
Greg,"maybe, but also no"
Greg,
Greg,kids are terrible
Greg,No money lel
Greg,If teaching payed better I totally would do that
Greg,it pays well in canada
Greg,I really enjoy teaching people things
Greg,Maybe in the states you don't make a lot
Greg,I would totally do adjunct professor ship
Greg,"not obscenely well, but pretty damn well"
Greg,Canada is real good
Greg,But getting tenure is hard AF
Greg,you can also teach grade school
Greg,easier to get into
Greg,kind of
Greg,I would want to teach highschool
Greg,cause at least in toronto the teacher's union is a mess
Greg,Fuck elementary
Greg,I remember I once wanted to teach english
Greg,and then I started editing people's essays
Greg,Gg
Greg,and I realized I could not look at high school-level essays for the rest of my life
Greg,I also realized that basically no one cares about english in high school
Greg,Gotta hit up that math / science
Greg,I've peer proofed some of my friends work before and holy hell some people don't know how to write/spell
Greg,"we got to choose from a huge number of damn good books to read and do a few essays on, including Oryx & Crake and Watchmen, I think other than a few people who read Watchmen because comic book I was the only person in the class who actually read the book"
Greg,which our teacher was well aware of and kinda roasted people for which was funny
Greg,but they can't actually do anything about it
Greg,and I think as a teacher I wouldn't take that very well
Greg,"In my English class, we have to do peer review for every essay and after peer reviewing 6 essays I can agree that most people don't know how to write. What amazes me is when people don't even properly follow the assignment instructions."
Greg,yup
Greg,most people consider english a filler course and don't bother putting in anything more than the minimal required effort
Greg,What's funny is how much they are gonna get fucked for that poor skill
Greg,More than math I have to write so many proposals and emails
Greg,Well I try to get an A in everything. Both because it makes getting in to the school you want more likely and I'm just a tryhard at everything by nature.
Greg,Not being able to take control of the written word is such a burden
Greg,2 years into college and I still have a 4.0 
Greg,I've ended up being saddled with handling like all the writing for all the interns at my office
Greg,As long as I get above a b I don't really care but when it comes to my job I'm a tryhard
Greg,I don't even understand half the stuff I'm doing write ups for
Greg,"That is with a math every year, 2 Biology courses, and 1 chemistry course."
Greg,If only jobs check GPA
Greg,he's going for actual college tho
Greg,which sure as hell check gpa
Greg,"I also am going to try for a scholarship to save my parents $25,000"
Greg,that too
Greg,man US college is pricy
Greg,FactZ
Greg,that's almost as much as my 4-year degree plus four years of housing (including the very pricy year in residence with a meal plan)
Greg,Yaw bruh
Greg,actually since it's in USD it's probably more
Greg,Im lucky I got 2 years free
Greg,My community college is like $900 as semester though so that's pretty cheap
Greg,yeah but it's community college so you kinda get what you pay for
Greg,"Professors are a mixed bag. I've had some great ones and some terrible ones. Student body is what you would expect from the price, most people seem far below my social class."
Greg,Lmao imagine having your parents paying for your college
Greg,They planned on doing it so why would I complain?
Greg,technically my grandpa's basically paying for my education cause he left a ton of money for it in his will but he's still alive so he's just kinda paying most of it now anyway -_-
Greg,I'm not planning on going to a 4 year school anymore
Greg,also most people can't afford to put themselves through college on a part-time job
Greg,especially not in the US
Greg,"What are your plans, Jed?"
Greg,Too fucking expensive even with a bunch of scholarships
Greg,"Prolly community college, I'm not sure if I'm gonna stay at home or move somewhere"
Greg,just come to canada for school
Greg,although we do charge extra for foreign students so it's probably not much cheaper
Greg,I might try and learn a trade or something not totally sure yet
Greg,I could have a job with John deer in Montana if I wanted to move out there
Greg,ok I just checked and international students pay like triple the domestic tuition
Greg,maybe don't come to canada for uni
Greg,at least at queen's
Greg,"it's like:
one year of eng degree, domestic: 7k
one year of eng degree, international: 23k"
Greg,That's about as much as my future school I think
Greg,the domestic or the international?
Greg,Yeah that's about the same as gcu before scholarship
Greg,International
Greg,^
Greg,oof
Greg,Gcu was gonna end up being 11k a year
Greg,Too many people go to college anyway
Greg,"that's eng tho, which is one of the pricier ones"
Greg,I think that only smart people who care about learning should go
Greg,"If you are just going to go, get C's, and skip class a lot why bother?"
Greg,C's get degrees
Greg,"cause the degree makes it easier to get a job, and as the saying goes, ""C's get degrees"""
Greg,dammit chris
Greg,you beat me
Greg,Maybe post-acceptance they do
Greg,For me I still need the A
Greg,What do you call the guy who got a C in medical school?
Greg,A doctor
Greg,Doctors
Greg,Exactly
Greg,Why get an A when I can get B's and C's and earn money while going
Greg,Being in Machine learning means I have to keep up on scientific papers and research constantly
Greg,My education doesn't end in college
Greg,I was mainly saying I wish college was less essential for life so it could be an option for smart people to specialize in a technical field.
Greg,I mean it's not gonna matter in 30 years
Greg,None of us are likely to be better than computers at anything
Greg,Good luck getting a science job on a high school degree
Greg,max that's what non-undergrad degrees are for
Greg,I know
Greg,College is still a minority pursuit
Greg,The average person doesn't attain higher education

Greg,Large aminos
Greg,I hope you all are doing well
Greg,:-)
Greg,Today is kind of a work mess
Greg,"At like 5 my manager gives me a task, passes me over to another guy to get more details. From the details I realize any solution like what he wants is gonna be extremely gross code. I do a bit of experimenting and realize there is no way to do it without rewriting a huge portion of the backend, so I ask both the guy who explained what I should do and my manager for clarification. Both had since left the office and gone offline on slack. In desperation, I reach out to the other guy who knows about the bit I'm working on (who is literally on his way to the airport) to ask for help, he suggests a less awful solution, I go ""great, but I don't have access to that code, can you give me access?""  That was fifteen minutes ago. He is presumably busy doing real life things and will not be getting back to me. This was implied to be a somewhat urgent task."
Greg,-- Tldr -- I'm kinda fucked because I got an urgent convoluted task and i don't have access to the code and everyone who might be able to help is gone
Greg,Pinned a message.
Greg,Oops
Greg,Damn discord mobile why do you put pin and edit right next to each other

Greg,also marss and nairo fight again
Greg,zss ditto in top 6 monkaW
Greg,every tournament
Greg,yea
Greg,marss loss to mkleo was very sad bois
Greg,joker is p good
Greg,Is the stream lagging a bit for you guys?
Greg,not really
Greg,nairo what
Greg,you just won with wolf
Greg,what are you doing
Greg,wat
Greg,WHAT IS GOING ON?????!?!?!?
Greg,nairo how did that just work
Greg,this is gonna be a wack vod
Greg,"Marss (ZSS) vs Nairo (ZSS, Wolf, Robin)"
Greg,HOLD THE FUCK UP
Greg,HE WENT DARK PIT
Greg,RANDOM SMASHER
Greg,how does he look so serious
Greg,MARSS IS LOSING STILL??
Greg,my best guess is he's feeling like mars figures out his characters later in the game but he's winning cause he gets an early lead so he's just swapping every game?
Greg,but like wtf nairo
Greg,you go down 0-2
Greg,fucking
Greg,500 iq
Greg,"switch to wolf, win"
Greg,"switch to robin, win"
Greg,switch to dark pit for game 5
Greg,NO WAY
Greg,lol
Greg,what was that
Greg,aight marss figured it out at the end
Greg,but honestly whaaaaat
Greg,Pit is so bad
Greg,alright marss is my favorite player but.......
Greg,he still almost got it tho
Greg,NAIRO IS INSANE
Greg,like that was still really close
Greg,this tourney is mega hype
Greg,salem beating dabuz with shulk
Greg,real question tho
Greg,like
Greg,why no palu
Greg,mkleo's sick joker
Greg,marss is very up vs nairo's palu
Greg,tweek vs mkleo winners finals
Greg,hot damn this man's joker is nuts
Greg,mkleo is crazy
Greg,I'm loving the fast fall upair regrab shenanagins
Greg,well i guess this tourney isn't hype anymore
Greg,mkleo's pretty nuts I dunno
Greg,mkleo just gonna stomp peeps
Greg,tension = 0
Greg,true
Greg,unless somehow marss gets into grands
Greg,but it's still hella nice
Greg,i dont think anyone else can beat leo
Greg,samsora always loses to leo and tweek just got bodied
Greg,I feel like tweek could try some other characters and he might have a chance
Greg,dunno how matchups gonna work
Greg,
Greg,loving these town and city games
Greg,
Greg,stage variety 4head
Greg,lets just remove all the interesting and distinct stages
Greg,ike pog
Greg,I'm focusing so hard on this match
Greg,Have to study both sides
Greg,the best players of max's two characters
Greg,except leo i guess
Greg,they're actually both playing super well
Greg,this is a great set
Greg,I'm better at down throw follow ups then mars lol
Greg,He missed some easy ones
Greg,"roy might be a wacky weight for it, I'm not sure"
Greg,he's a weird weight for a lot of things
Greg,tweek is getting demolished
Greg,That was brutal
Greg,if only marss beat tweek so that this set could have been close
Greg,nvm
Greg,im loving the dynamic between the top players in ultimate

Greg,@everyone  it's Saturday. Let's game
Greg,Which Boss?
Greg,JP
Greg,I assumed so
Greg,What a cool that man is
Greg,Like he was saying “yeah the new Spider-Man trailer basically spoils endgame” and I said “well yeah I guess it doesn’t feature tony in it” and he flips his lid on me saying how he hasn’t seen endgame yet
Greg,Bruh
Greg,:-(
Greg,Wait if that was the whole conversation then he totally in the wrong
Greg,If he's seen the trailer he knows what happens to Tony

Greg,@Homies How is website? http://pathtoneuralink.com/
Greg,Pretty sure this is an error
Greg,
Greg,????
Greg,THAT IS STRANG
Greg,I am seeing that too
Greg,
Greg,@Zain
Greg,What is causing this
Greg,is it the '
Greg,it happened on the bottom too
Greg,that is so weird
Greg,Its wherever I use apostrophe or quotes
Greg,Hmm
Greg,Let me bugfix
Greg,I've seen this before on my poorly designed home school website. I'm not sure how to fix it but I'm pretty sure that its replacing non-letter characters like ' with stuff.
Greg,Looks like I have to use the unicode character for apostrophe's and quotes
Greg,@Sak von Sak Is that my problem?
Greg,it shouldn't be a problem but it depends how you've put together the non-html parts of the website maybe
Greg,it can't hurt to unicode it
Greg,I have no backend
Greg,Its all shiny sauce
Greg,is your front end just raw html & css?
Greg,Yes
Greg,weird
Greg,Bootstrap for the navbar and footer
Greg,Font awesome
Greg,Simple stuff
Greg,"something weird is going on with the formatting, I'm looking at it in chrome dev tools and there's a lot of weirdness"
Greg,No don't roast my code
Greg,does this happen locally?
Greg,
Greg,no like the way chrome is interpreting it is weird
Greg,What am I looking for?
Greg,"just, if you test this code not in the site does it have the same problem?"
Greg,no
Greg,Well
Greg,I don't know now
Greg,Because I unicoded everything
Greg,it might be something weird with whoever's hosting it
Greg,Dreamhost
Greg,They are freaky
Greg,but also I don't know why you have quotes in your <p> tags
Greg,it shouldn't be necessary
Greg,uhh
Greg,I dont
Greg,That is weird
Greg,Wait
Greg,"<p """">"
Greg,"or <p>

STUFF
""""

</p>"
Greg,the second
Greg,oh
Greg,"<p>
""
stuff
""
</p>"
Greg,"should just be
<p>stuff</p>"
Greg,I wrote all the P tag content in a word document and probably put unecessary quotes
Greg,Any other tips for formatting stuff?
Greg,I can't tell for sure cause what I'm seeing isn't your actual code
Greg,just how chrome is parsing it
Greg,Problem has been resolved
Greg,Thanks unicode
Greg,it's still weird that it was happening in the first place
Greg,Yeah I looked in my code
Greg,I didn't put quotes inside my p tags
Greg,Chrome is weird
Greg,or dreamhost has HIV
Greg,probably dreamhost

Greg,"That's 6pst, which is where e3 is"
Greg,Jesus Christ that was a stressful game
Greg,That last quarter was crazy
Greg,Did your team win?
Greg,Nope
Greg,losty by 1
Greg,It was
Greg,rip
Greg,106-105
Greg,wow close
Greg,The raptors missed 9 points in the last minute
Greg,Then the last shot of the game that could have one it
Greg,Was nowhere near the basket
Greg,Literally hit it off the backboard
Greg,Why don't they just split the game into 5 quarters instead of 4 and play best of 5 quarters. That would make more of the game feel impactful.
Greg,Too bad these sports are too established to ever make a common sense change like this.
Greg,i was tryna trade with some guy in PoE but he was speaking korean so i got my korean speaking friend to help me

Greg,Boys
Greg,I finally
Greg,Got
Greg,a god damn
Greg,shift
Greg,we all said yes
Greg,@Homies Road Trip! we getting the whole gang together to go fight @Zain
Greg,What a great idea to spend time with the boys
Greg,And fuck @Zain
Greg,what did he do
Greg,"We start with picking up me then we cross the border to get kameron then we cross the border to pick up schlef then we cross the border to get jed and andrew then we cross the border to get chris then we cross the border to get smithy and karina then we cross the border to get zack then we cross the border to get max and ava then we cross the border to fight fusion then we cross the border to go to LAX to all fly home, we're leaving hte car there"
Greg,That is the worst route lol
Greg,it is optimal for border crossing
Greg,What do you mean?
Greg,Why are we doing this
Greg,Can you come up with a better one?
Greg,Also come get me
Greg,Me and chris are basically next to each other
Greg,because zain is a raidboss so we need to get the entire party together to combine our strength
Greg,maybe they want a long road trip for fun uwu
Greg,okay because zack complained i have cleaned up the route
Greg,Yes that's much more sane
Greg,okay but why in the first place
Greg,why are we fighting zain
Greg,i need to throw hands with zain
Greg,he knows what he's done
Greg,and i need my team to back me up
Greg,
Greg,It's only like 3.5 days of continuous driving
Greg,So practically about a week
Greg,i prefer the 2 weeks of continuous route
Greg,oh then we gotta get back
Greg,so double it
Greg,What happened to ditching the car at LAX?
Greg,witht he optimal route we dont do that
Greg,Ah
Greg,So it's time & distance efficient but not cost because we lose the cost of the car
Greg,Probably a van actually
Greg,We are taking Mike's 5 seater
Greg,Its gotta fit like ten of us tho
Greg,we will strap yall to the top
Greg,
Greg,Are we doing this?
Greg,I am so down
Greg,I'll help pay for gas 
Greg,
Greg,Guys can we please do this
Greg,even distribution its about $500 a person
Greg,Uhh
Greg,uh
Greg,
Greg,4200 miles / 300 miles per tank = 14 fillups
Greg,we but we renting an rv
Greg,to fit everyone
Greg,14 fill ups x 12 gallons  per gillup = 196 gallons
Greg,4 dollars per gallon x 196 gallons = $784
Greg,/ 7people = $74 per person
Greg,How much is an RV rental?
Greg,yeah but we renting an rv so at 100 a night figure 3 weeks thats 2100 plus its not as fuel efficient as your estimate
Greg,all these numbers are calculated with the route where we ping pong across hte country and go over hte border 9 times btw
Greg,Lol No!!!
Greg,XD
Greg,Don't use that route
Greg,Take the optimal one
Greg,nah
Greg,What's even the point if we don't use the non-optimal route
Greg,I CANNOT AFFORD THE SUB OPTIMAL ROUTE
Greg,sub optimal route or we walk
Greg,Bet

Greg,"@everyone I am hosting a fun frostbite server event that I encourage everyone to participate it. The nature of the event will not be revealed until the setup is complete. The reason for this will become apparent once it begins. For now, all you need to do to help me prepare for this event is to post the names of things you like (probably around 5-10 things would be the best number) in the submissions channel. You can post anything, from something as vague as ""history"" to as specific as ""pizza""."
Greg,@The Rona I'm down for OoT randomizer

Greg,
Greg,
Greg,@Meetup Created a role for @ing meetup related people. I gave this role to everyone who will possibly be there. The official days for the meetup were decided yesterday as July 19th (Friday) to July 29th (Monday). The airport Chris's dad would like people to fly in to is Toronto Pearson (YYZ). If anyone has a problem with these days please let us know soon so we can possibly make slight adjustments before I buy my plane tickets.
Greg,is it okay if i fly into Hamilton Regional (HAM)?
Greg,You literally live there dude
Greg,You can but you would have to walk over
Greg,F
Greg,ac work
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,Fighting Game Controller Tier List
Greg,I almost agree with this
Greg,"But I would at least put the power glove up to A, maybe even S"
Greg,maybe swap the power glove and the vive?
Greg,Due to how easy it is to control
Greg,N a h
Greg,just
Greg,bump the glove to A tier
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Like top of A
Greg,
Greg,Ok looks good now
Greg,I would reverse this and move the wii remote and it would be perfect
Greg,you really think fighting your opponent IRL should be 2nd bottom tier?
Greg,tbh I had no idea what that picture meant
Greg,it means clocking your opoonent in the jaw so you are the only remaining fighter
Greg,honestly that strat is pretty foolproof
Greg,and its a controller cause you control who actually is able to play
Greg,s tier free
Greg,Yeah but the one drawback it has is that it only works during lan
Greg,Because of that I think it deserves the A spot
Greg,Mmmmm you could just swat them
Greg,Would that count as it's own thing though?
Greg,Or an extension of fighting them
Greg,I would
Greg,i would
Greg,"@Meetup Tickets purchased! People Currently confirmed: Max, Chris, Zack, Benson, Devon. Pending: Andrew, Kameron, Jed. Definite NO: Zain, Smithy, Ava. Toronto Frostbite meetup 2019 is looking to be very good."
Greg,Anyone in need of a passport should take care of that as soon as possible
Greg,
Greg,Excited
Greg,take me off hte list
Greg,i aint going
Greg,oh okay
Greg,im starting my own meetup
Greg,
Greg,with blackjack and hookers
Greg,you know what
Greg,forget hte hookers
Greg,ill be in devon's pool
Greg,the meetup is exclusively in my pool
Greg,once you enter
Greg,you cannot leave
Greg,put me down as a definite yes for dober's sick pool meetup
Greg,
Greg,Aw hell yeah
Greg,
Greg,How are you going to play Blackjack in the pool though
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,already got it covered
Greg,Fuck
Greg, flight would only be $500
Greg,And passport is like 100 I think
Greg,@Max what other things would I need to account for costwise
Greg,uhhhh
Greg,It'll probably depend on if I can take a week off work
Greg,We are staying at Chris's house
Greg,Food/activities?
Greg,I'm not really sure how much of that we need to buy
Greg,Chris should tell us how much his planned activities cost
Greg,@Jed Want the meetup role for regular updates and access to the meetup planning channel?
Greg,Yee
Greg,I'ma try and make this work
Greg,Work will be my only problem I think
Greg,I'll go and revise my earlier message
Greg,@Mr. Airplane if I end up going to the Meetup and you don't I'll fly to Maryland and tell you that I'm disappointed in you
Greg,Oh shit
Greg,Jed coming now too hopefully
Greg,
Greg,I have the money it's all about my work
Greg,Try to book it off right now
Greg,Cause I just started last week and I'm already taking a week vacation this week
Greg,oh
Greg,You can do it
Greg,I believe
Greg,Sending positive vibes in your direction
Greg,I'm not a super essential part of the farm yet like I'm just an extra pair of hands
Greg,So hopefully 
Greg,farm?
Greg,And honestly this Meetup is probably more important to me than this job
Greg,Yeah I work on a farm now
Greg,what kind of farm
Greg,like whats growing
Greg,the devil's lettuce
Greg,
Greg,Yeah we grow hemp
Greg,But it's also a dairy and other crops
Greg,oh shit dawg
Greg,Literally every farm in Oregon is growing hemp cause it's the only place you can
Greg,Also there's a chance I'll be able to get a day or two off during the meetup bit I'll have to ask pretty far in advance so if we could figure out which days would be best ahead of time thatd be good
Greg,The meetup has been decided as July 19th to 29th
Greg,@Max cs?
Greg,^
Greg,Sure be there soon
Greg,@Sak von Sak We should probably be able to work around whichever days are easiest for you
Greg,They'll all be about equal except some Wednesdays and Thursdays
Greg,@Cs:go
Greg,@Max join up dork
Greg,I meant more for events that I normally wouldn't be able to join cause they'd be during work
Greg,
Greg,Joined the server.
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL
Greg,@The Rona that's your house right
Greg,Yeah
Greg,I might be fucked passport wise
Greg,Just get it now
Greg,
Greg,It can take like 2 months to get though
Greg,I think there should be an Express option.
Greg,I have a valid passport card
Greg,So idk if I just need to renew and get a book or apply for a new one
Greg,NO passyport here :/
Greg,Largeable Sad
Greg,I will not be procuring meetup attendature REEEEEEEEE

Greg,I'm down
Greg,@Max  ❓
Greg,chris when down?
Greg,cause i ain't staying up late anymore
Greg,don't think I want to
Greg,why not 
Greg,The amount of time required to be good enough at a game to have fulfilling speedruns of it is time I would rather spend doing other things.
Greg,i dunno about that tho
Greg,i feel like once you pin down the necessary tech runs should be pretty fulfilling
Greg,I ain't staying up late anymore either

Greg,Otherwise a passport still works
Greg,https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification
Greg,Identification
Greg,Adult passengers 18 and over must show valid identification at the airport checkpoint in order to travel.
Greg,Yeah learners permit maybe not ok but the other stuff on the list is
Greg,Just get your license idiot
Greg,Also I don't think in gonna be able to make it @Max it's a little too last minute
Greg,
Greg,The passport would cost like 250-300 to get on time
Greg,you could also just go without
Greg,it'll take a little longer but iirc they just ask you questions
Greg,also if you were tryna fly to toronto i thought you needed ur passport anyways

Greg,
Greg,"For those who didn't know, Ally (28) has been exposed for being in a gay relationship with Captain Zack (a MINOR) and has now retired from smash. Let him never return and hopefully go to jail."
Greg,"Uuuh you're missing some important parts, cause I'm pretty sure it was technically legal age-wise (just extremely, extremely sketchy), the real issues from what Ive heard of the situation involved physical and sexual assault"
Greg,"So yes, hopefully he ends up in jail"
Greg,But hey at least this isn't like the Nightmare situation where it was technically legal and he had tons of people on his side
Greg,But he'd basically forced a 16 year old to date and sleep his 24-year-old self
Greg,At least people are pretty universally against ally
Greg,(Also tbh it's weird to me that you focused on the gay part rather than most of the actual problems)
Greg,(Most people already knew that they're both gay)
Greg,"Aight I looked into it a bit more and apparently the assault stuff was exaggerations and theorizing, so that's less bad at least"
Greg,Still creepy borderline pedophilia and I'm glad its come out and that ally is retiring
Greg,But he's not gonna end up in jail cause it was technically legal
Greg,Max doesnt care if it was legal
Greg,pride month is over
Greg,     
Greg,that makes me sad. ally was such a good player
Greg,"I wouldn't say I focused on the gay part at all, I just mentioned it for those who might be unaware. I literally capitalized the word minor to avoid this problem and show the area I was emphasizing. But I guess people would read it that way anyway because its me. Just to clarify, no, I do not think gay people should go to jail. I was referring to the fact that he was dating an underaged person."
Greg,yeha i agree with max there it didnt really seem like he focused on it more like an offhand comment
Greg,"I mean a) you started with gay, which is usually an emphasis thing, and b) it has no bearing on it being problematic and the phrasing makes it sound like you're giving it roughly even billing with everything else. I get that it wasnt intentional but also given your general opinions it doesn't necessarily come across as such."
Greg,"Well, sorry if you took it the wrong way. Maybe I should have left out that detail entirely given my history."
Greg,Also there's a bit of an issue with people who do equate homosexuality and pedophilia so its definitely somewhere to watch your phrasing for potential misinterpretation
Greg,"I definitely see a difference considering one is consensual and I only object for religious reasons, which you may not agree with but I hope you at least understand. While the other is taking advantage of a difference in intelligence and being a predator."
Greg,"Was basically making sure there wasnt a misunderstanding, and also at the time I thought there had also been assault which I thought was more important to mention"
Greg,gamers rise up and join vc im lonely
Greg,In short: poor communication kills and we both didn't do a great job

Greg,Isn't that the guy Zain always mentions?
Greg,Yes
Greg,his whole brand is debating dumb people
Greg,which as a concept is already pretty trashy
Greg,Mob Psycho 100 season 1 finished. Totally not for me but I get why its popular. 6/10
Greg,@Mr. Airplane many people today believe in some pretty crazy ass shit he does debate these crazy people. If he or other people like him waren’t to do this they could and would push there agenda and make more “crazy” people and so thats why its good that he can will and has debated these crazy people. On the topic of likeabilty this is entirly subjective so if you don’t like hin alright cool i guess.
Greg,wow dude i didn't realize that destiny was so heroic
Greg,truly the savior of our generation
Greg,"hi man i'm just addressing the points you brought up. i wake up and i see my lord and savior destiny chan being insulted can't believe this, but in all seriousness he's not a nice person to any extent but the reasoning you brought up for not likeing him is pretty week"
Greg,@Mr. Airplane i dont think destiny is the least likable person on the internet I'd have to say its def @The Rona. Destiny is a close second tho

Greg,the question was what book does moses lead the jews out of egypt
Greg,The old testament or the Torah as the Jews call it.
Greg,the asnwer was exodus
Greg,Oh you meant like that
Greg,I thought you meant more generally
Greg,wouldn't that make the bible the bible part 2
Greg,and the book of mormon the bible part 3
Greg,That would be the case if a Jew is the one answering
Greg,It is a matter of perspective

Greg,NEURALINK UPDATE [OFFICIAL]
Greg,"This is not a Path To Neuralink episode. This is my take on an official announcement from Neuralink. At around 6:50pm 7/10/2019, Neuralink announced via Twit..."
Greg,Alright question time
Greg,Is it rude to make a phone call on a bus
Greg,Not is it allowable but is it impolite
Greg,It depends on how loud you are being
Greg,Like if you are asking everyone on the bus to quiet down so you can hear
Greg,That's rude as hell
Greg,But if you've got earbuds in or something
Greg,You good
Greg,???
Greg,How do earbuds change anything
Greg,I don't know how to explain that any other way
Greg,Also obviously emergencies are exempt
Greg,I think talking on the phone on a bus is obviously rude
Greg,People just don't understand the concept of public spaces
Greg,What's the difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you?
Greg,I don't think that talking to someone next to you on the bus is polite either
Greg,But...
Greg,I mean
Greg,Just don't be loud
Greg,One could argue that talking on the phone is more avoidable
Greg,I mean for you to be heard in a bus or metro you gotta talk kinda loud
Greg,This is why earbuds are effective
Greg,You should be able to hear them without problem
Greg,And you don't have to talk as loud if you speak directly into the microphone of the earbuds
Greg,"I feel like if you try to keep the conversation to a minimum we good, but if you're voluntarily entering a conversation that's pretty rude"
Greg,It's a matter of respecting public space
Greg,I guess
Greg,Ok both of you are wrong how is talking to the person next to you rude and how is talking on your phone rude and obviously I'm talking about at a respectable volume
Greg,if you think talking on the bus is rude ur a bitchass
Greg,Dude that's literally my argument at the beginning
Greg,Just keep it at a respectable volume
Greg,if someone on a bus talks so loud to the point of a problem someone will tell them to shut up
Greg,Bro if you guys don't understand the significance of the discussion you're so obviously part of the problem
Greg,My argument is that people fail to respect public spaces
Greg,our argument is that the discussion has no significance
Greg,Yes if you just circumvent the entirety of my argument obviously I appear to be wrong
Greg,if youre bothered by people talking in a public space then you have the problem not the speaker
Greg,public spacws arent inheritly silent
Greg,Respect public spaces people can still talk to each other and respect the people around them
Greg,I agree with boi Greg
Greg,yes zain that's true but again that's not really my point
Greg,also greg
Greg,'s argument is actually braindead
Greg,YOU CAN'T CHOOSE TO BE IN A PUBLIC SPACE OR NOT ITS NOT YOUR FAULT IF ITS UNCOMFORTABLE
Greg,???
Greg,that actually makes zero sense to me
Greg,BRO IF YOU DONT LIKE  RACISM JUST MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE
Greg,4HEAD
Greg,
Greg,I gotta say this is a mess
Greg,thats not a good comparison tho
Greg,racism is a real issue people talking on a bus is a mild annoyance at best
Greg,I don't see how talking in a public space is a problem
Greg,i mean the conversation was fine until these two bozos just lack the understanding of what's being discussed entirely
Greg,ok does people talking in class bother you
Greg,what about a library
Greg,not really
Greg,If I'm riding the bus with a friend are we both supposed to just sit there in silence?
Greg,Kameron
Greg,^
Greg,also just because it may not bother you it can bother others
Greg,Wait stop those are completely different spaces
Greg,That's what I said
Greg,Those are terrible examples
Greg,that too
Greg,Both with existing expectations of quietness
Greg,A bus is not a silent space
Greg,Those comparison are so bad'
Greg,ok but there aren't many other public spaces
Greg,the park
Greg,Cause in a class you're supposed to listen to a teacher
Greg,the street
Greg,"its not a matter of does it bother me, its about respecting the wishes of others"
Greg,And all libraries have rules against it
Greg,In a public space that has no predetermined rules of being quiet
Greg,But how do you know it bothers them
Greg,u can talk as you like
Greg,the street does not fit into the way we are using 'public space' here
Greg,This clearly something you think
Greg,BUSES ALSO HAVE RULES AGAINST TALKING ON THE BUS YOU MORONS
Greg,???
Greg,they literally do
Greg,Not the buses I'm on
Greg,Likewise
Greg,if you really are causing serious trouble for someone then they have to notify you to stop or just deal w it
Greg,Also ive never heard of a bus with talking eules
Greg,its not a matter of serious trouble its a matter of respect
Greg,Kameron I want your source
Greg,What the fuck kind of buses do they have where you live???
Greg,its not a rule as in if you break it you're removed
Greg,Respect towards who
Greg,i can confirm busses here have no such rules
Greg,but a lot of busses have signs that say to keep noise to a minimum
Greg,bro where
Greg,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/bus-commuters-hold-all-calls-or-else/
Greg,"Bus Commuters Hold All Calls, or Else"
Greg,"On some New Jersey commuter buses, cellphone use is banned. But some passengers defy the rules and make business and personal calls, which leads to confrontations with drivers and other riders who demand quiet."
Greg,"Yeah there's a difference between a conversation and what they're talking about, which is stuff like yelling or blasting music"
Greg,Ok that's wack
Greg,Thats siper weird lmao
Greg,2008
Greg,why new jersey gonna have some rule like that when like
Greg,And I've never seen anything like that anywhere I've been
Greg,proper cities with populated transport dont
Greg,That's interesting by that I mean retarded
Greg,There's literally no difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you
Greg,Again
Greg,Just keep it respectable
Greg,yes chris I agree
Greg,Also this article is from 2008
Greg,ok ill admit its the first thing i found
Greg,but you guys were like: 'this doesn't exist'
Greg,it definitely exists
Greg,but you probably have not looked for it
Greg,well everything probably exists but a exception does not make the rule
Greg,this is the same argument as sniffling during a test
Greg,it simply demostrates a lack of understanding that your actions may impact others around you
Greg,Sniffling is uncontrollable tho its totally not
Greg,false
Greg,you can
Greg,Wait what
Greg,bring a tissue
Greg,wipe your nose on your shirt
Greg,Sniffing is deffinitly controllable
Greg,Just wipe your nose
Greg,ask to go to the bathroom
Greg,if a tissue isnt provided or if you forget then what
Greg,wipe your nose on your shirt
Greg,thats actually nasty
Greg,imagine getting upset at people sniffling
Greg,
Greg,Mike
Greg,"Shut up, whore"
Greg,
Greg,so mad
Greg,realize that you are sick and then should bring a tissue for your test
Greg,Just dont be sick
Greg,
Greg,plus a test still has an expectation of quiet so sniffling is still.more severe than talking on a bus
Greg,its not a matter of severity my guy
Greg,A bus has no expectation of quiet
Greg,ok that's just raw false
Greg,so there is no reason to assume people want quiet
Greg,if someone wants quiet then its their job to ask for it
Greg,if someone played their music on the bus without earbuds would people be annoyed
Greg,NO ITS NOT
Greg,in a library its different
Greg,you shouldn't have to ask others to be respectful
Greg,if someone plays music such that its annoying then just tell them to stop
Greg,yes but that doesn't mean its rude in the first place
Greg,Its not disrespectful to not assume people want quiet
Greg,*not rude
Greg,Greg is totally wrong here
Greg,^
Greg,You just shouldn't blast music out of your phone on the bus
Greg,well no you shouldnt
Greg,Nobody wants to hear that shit except for you
Greg,because loud music is always annoying
Greg,It is though
Greg,"but talking on a bus isnt usually annoying, especially at a reasonable volume"
Greg,yes we all agree
Greg,If it doesnt cause problems in general then why is it suddenly disrepectful
Greg,that makes 0 sense
Greg,because using the condition reasonable volume inherently means that what you are doing isn't disrespectful
Greg,"again, your example is unrelated to the argument"
Greg,If you want silence in a place that does not demand silence then its not everone elses job to know you want solence
Greg,??????
Greg,Ur arguement is also totally related
Greg,im actually done discussing this with someone who clearly doesn't even understand the issue
Greg,breakfast time
Greg,You cant just say theres an issue and assume i will accept that
Greg,you have to establish the problem first
Greg,he said no and left
Greg,bruh i told you its breakfast time
Greg,i already said why its a problem
Greg,I dont assume everyone is going to be quiet unless its a place like a library
Greg,I dont think its rude for people to play music in public
Greg,Kameron your argument is actually retarded. People pointed out a valid flaw and you moved the fucking goal post
Greg,@Homies game time
Greg,@The Rona 
Greg,Certified gamer moment
Greg,@Trapezoider i see what you mean and ur probably right i think how i phrased the initial question was not what we ended up discussing tbh
Greg,but yeah my initial take was overly spice
Greg,im gay
Greg,yikes
Greg,thats pretty gay
Greg,also chris apparently investigations have a better chance of the odogaron gen
Greg,I already got the gem
Greg,Also Gavin was the one who typed that message
Greg,sure pal
Greg,sure pal
Greg,sure pal
Greg,sure pal
Greg,sure pal
Greg,I want to die

Greg,watch out for the warn
Greg,@Homies gamer time

Greg,I actually expected a mini poop war
Greg,Love you bro no homo
Greg,
Greg,I team defense fort 2 at 7:30pm
Greg,Attack on Titan Season 3 is actually amazing and one of the best shows I've ever seen
Greg,Highly recommend
Greg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UH_ys1jnDg
Greg,Money joon
Greg,@Max agreed I finished it like two weeks ago
Greg,h e c k  y e s
Greg,1000000/10
Greg,Rise up gamers
Greg,Shows fucking excellent
Greg,Can't wait for season 4
Greg,
Greg,Its labeled as the final season if you were not aware
Greg,No
Greg,Not facts
Greg,I looked into this
Greg,
Greg,Straight from myanimelist
Greg,https://www.google.com/amp/s/screenrant.com/attack-titan-season-3-game-thrones-mistakes/amp/
Greg,Attack On Titan Is Making The Same Mistake As Game Of Thrones
Greg,"Game of Thrones rushed its ending, now Attack on Titan is doing the same."
Greg,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1148984/Attack-on-titan-season-4-release-date-cast-trailer-plot-when-is-attack-on-titan-out/amp&ved=2ahUKEwjN6YPQhK7jAhVGIDQIHUifCbEQFjALegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw0J1Soh4WbfKnbZkWHLrajo&ampcf=1

Greg,You are wrong
Greg,There's still like 50 chapters of manga
Greg,
Greg,I don't think that matters
Greg,This season could be long
Greg,also manga chapters are short
Greg,MAL only posts verifiable information
Greg,like most manga I've read where I've also seen the show it's usually like 2-5 chapters per episode
Greg,(5 is usually for fights where the action that takes up a lot of panels takes not a lot of screen time)
Greg,Wow so that wouldn't even be a full 12 episodes at 5 per episode
Greg,(it's usually closer to 2-3)
Greg,@Ultimate ultimate?
Greg,Max season 3 part 2 is over
Greg,I know that
Greg,The show has another season coming
Greg,Next summer
Greg,Yes that is what I was saying
Greg,Omg
Greg,4head
Greg,Also its October
Greg,WHAT
Greg,no tis july
Greg,its october
Greg,YO THATS WAY SOO ER
Greg,@Feral Nebula FACTZ?
Greg,yes
Greg,NEXT October
Greg,^
Greg,at least for now
Greg,2020
Greg,because AOT has a track record of changing plans
Greg,so don't count on it one hundo percent
Greg,They may want to time the manga and anime to end at the same time to maximize sales
Greg,@Max @Sak von Sak ultimate?

Greg,@Max @Sak von Sak wanna watch together?
Greg,I made the comeback though so its fine
Greg,last few minutes of D&D then sure
Greg,I'll join after getting some food
Greg,I also discovered a really cool pika edgeguard where you drag down with fair and then footstool. I have no idea if I could repeat it consistently but it was so cool. Gimped a mario at like 60%.
Greg,lol fiction's DI is so bad
Greg,melee looks so much worse without slippy
Greg,
Greg,He is using all the wrong moves
Greg,"Max, you didn't deserve that GSP anyways, Pika is annoying
~ Benson probably"
Greg,Pikachu is so much fun
Greg,i dont hate max that much
Greg,to say shit like that
Greg,I like Pikachu too
Greg,tweek game 5 vs a brawlhalla player monkaW
Greg,Who?
Greg,sandstorm
Greg,Wrenched
Greg,Oh
Greg,
Greg,Who does the brawlhalla guy play?
Greg,he's playing ken
Greg,ken is busted
Greg,Ken seems pretty good
Greg,I've always been a Ken believer
Greg,Ken got buffed
Greg,He used to be terrible
Greg,I stand by what I said
Greg,Imagine wearings knee wraps when squatting less than 135
Greg,I don't even know what analogy to give to explain how stupid this guy is
Greg,It's like spending $1000 on a custom GameCube controller for your first tournament
Greg,Smh
Greg,Maybe he has weak knees
Greg,Nonono
Greg,Not those type of knee straps
Greg,I'm talking knee wraps that apply so much force on the lower half of the squat that your legs can do nothing BUT GO UP
Greg,
Greg,Meant for guys to squat 800 lbs
Greg,Very bad for the knees
Greg,
Greg,Maybe he's just weak as fuck
Greg,And needs those to lift
Greg,4head
Greg,That's not how dis work
Greg,@Master Memers TF2
Greg,???

Greg,because twitter sucka da large pp
Greg,Nestle’s children companies
Greg,@Master Memers TEAM FORT LATER
Greg,Yes Sir
Greg,Wizzy just won the smash 64 major
Greg,Zain 4 stocked Hbox
Greg,zain 4-stocked hbox
Greg,woah
Greg,
Greg,If you watch Leffen's restream he is pointing out all the stuff Hbox is messing up. Its actually really funny how much stuff he gets wrong but doesn't get punished for because he is puff.
Greg,hbox bad
Greg,leff man real good
Greg,Hbox's DI is actually so bad
Greg,'dreamland isn't a free win for puff' is such a pepega opinion
Greg,alright puff is the best character in the game im down
Greg,especially in b05
Greg,Welcome to the club
Greg,marth #2
Greg,b05 actually favors puff and marth so hard
Greg,Having a free win is nice
Greg,It sure would be good if we had a ban... 
Greg,it actually makes viewing melee so much less fun
Greg,Ultimate is over an hour late lol
Greg,Puff is so interesting
Greg,I'd never thought id see the day where i was waiting for another smash game bored outta my mind watching melee
Greg,The ruleset needs to be updated to reflect the new meta
Greg,Make Melee Great Again
Greg,"Ban wobbling, ledge grab limit, bans in bo5"
Greg,100%
Greg,At least ultimate nerfed Olimar
Greg,Olimar being not as good makes the game so much better to watch
Greg,ultimate meta is kinda neat
Greg,the problem is that the boring matches in melee are also alot longer than the hype ones are
Greg,Banning puff would make the game more interesting
Greg,so like 3 boring matches in a top 8 takes up half the time
Greg,... or more
Greg,unfrozen stadium 
Greg,Why are they good for bo5?
Greg,"anyone: lands 1-2 hits
toph: THATS BIG DAMAGE"
Greg,Bo5 has no stage ban. Puff and Marth each have a stage they are massively favored on vs most characters.
Greg,I dont like toph
Greg,hbox di lol
Greg,Pepelaugh
Greg,sad
Greg,pillowpet guy pog
Greg,DALLAS LUCKY
Greg,I feel like I'm listening to a conversation of exchange students ^

Greg,I love this game
Greg,twitch chat can probably claim to be a proper dialect at this point
Greg,4 people on commentary is too much
Greg,especially when 3/4 aren't very good
Greg,alright scratch that it's 3 commentators the 3 not good ones
Greg,Twitch English

Greg,@Mr. Airplane mhw?

Greg,rejected
Greg,its tuff out there

Greg,@The Rona
Greg,Are you busy?
Greg,@Homies Bois I'm so sick this sucks do fucking bad

Greg,get well soon
Greg,

Greg,also how did you make that so quickly
Greg,that looks like a clear downgrade of my paint art
Greg,How the fuck
Greg,THAT WAS 1 MINUTE
Greg,"Thanks I've been bad the whole day wiping my nose, gruggling salt water and drinking non deleted water my throat feels like the Sahara desert my dudes"
Greg,I know something that will moisten it up

Greg,@Meetup DAILY  VLOGS 
Greg,is 15 all there is? I don't want a repeat of yesterday
Greg,Yes
Greg,get devon to send the picture at some point before i finish if you guys want it in the video
Greg,So my parents are selling our house
Greg,And the real estate agent came over
Greg,but I didnt know that
Greg,So I walk out of the bathroom
Greg,Oh pog they are moving in with you
Greg,In nothing but my undies
Greg,
Greg,Thats a way to meet someone
Greg,Nah
Greg,They arae moving north
Greg,@Trapezoider you got an apartment already?
Greg,yessir
Greg,when are you moving into it?
Greg,also I'm sorry to disappoint but I just can't do the daily vlog today
Greg,i can throw it together if you want but I seriously can't take anymore of this meme editing right now
Greg,or maybe not even that why is this taking so long to accomplish nothing
Greg,I'm so irritiated
Greg,I don't want to do this anymore
Greg,Don't blame me when there is no vlog today
Greg,
Greg,hey
Greg,don't be mean to me
Greg,you guys are putting pressure on me to spend hours of my day everyday making dumb memes
Greg,it's starting to stress me out
Greg,
Greg,get devon to do it like he originally was
Greg,Devon is here though
Greg,We have no way to edit
Greg,uhghdughudfhgksjdfskldjf
Greg,maybe I'll try again later
Greg,I still need that photo of the bathroom and the video from Benson
Greg,"but probably no more memes tomorrow. Don't expect too much, it really does take a lot of time. (also I might be busy all day the 24th and 25th)"
Greg,okay well this one is done. I'm rendering it rn. I didn't do either of Benson's requests both because the first one took too much editing and the second one bc I never received the clip for it.
Greg,Just to make a statement if you guys really need me to I can continue editing the clips together if for whatever reason none of you can but the fancy editing and memes will be minimal from here on out because this is taking upwards of two and a half hours everyday and it's really draining. glad you guys enjoyed the memes while they lasted though.
Greg,i enjoyed it for the first two days but its just too much im sorry

Greg,how much does fighter pack cost?
Greg,25 dollars yikes
Greg,That's for everyone though
Greg,yeah but i thought that hero only costs 6 dollars
Greg,so it'd be cheaper to buy 4 characters
Greg,and then not buy banjo cause he looks dumb
Greg,
Greg,real talk you'd probably still save money cause most tournaments give you a discount for bringing a setup
Greg,and not having all the characters means they can't use your setup
Greg,Yeah but Kameron dumb
Greg,i dont really want tournies to use my setup cause then i'd have to stay there after going 0-4

Greg,then we play mhw
Greg,but then the day after i get back i go to new york for a splat lan
Greg,We can play tonight tho
Greg,"Random idea: Settlers of Catan could be made into a more consistent game by replacing the dice with a deck of cards with the numbers 1-12 on them. The deck would have the same number of each number as that number has dots on the board. For example, there would be one card with ""2"" and one card with ""12"" while there would be five cards with ""8"". The deck would be completely drawn through before reshuffling. This would ensure players get the exact return they should on their investments into certain tiles and would eliminate a lot of randomness from the game."
Greg,doesnt that give a totally unfair advantage to the person selecting second
Greg,since the second person geenrally had the best choices overall for picks
Greg,I don't think this change would give an unfair advantage. There will be games where the person who picks good tiles will get an even bigger advantage if they get lucky with rolls and games where they do very poorly because of bad luck. The first scenario is unfun because that person is highly likely to win and the second is unfun because that person is just losing to luck. My rules change would just balance out the outliers and make the game more dependent on skill.
Greg,"Ultimately managing resources based on luck is a type of skill, vs knowing ""oh i have a sheep coming so I dont have to do anything"""
Greg,It also makes player trading worthwhile

Greg,"just sorta show up whenever, Kameron's finishing an OW game"
Greg,"I really dislike the design of the Hero. Random crits, random down B, random move on the down B, instant kill. Whyyyyyyyy"
Greg,@The Rona WOAH I HEARD U WAS TALKING SHIT
Greg,the hero sounds lit
Greg,what are you talking about
Greg,random crits?
Greg,that's my jam
Greg,DansGame
Greg,i love being rewarded for being bad
Greg,"Max, you listed the same point twice"
Greg,@Max
Greg,ima be back in 10
Greg,ima leave in 10
Greg,"@The Rona Those are two different reasons. The down B is inherently random by selecting 4 moves. One of the possible moves to get is a move that does something completely random, even potentially harmful to yourself."
Greg,I forgot about that one
Greg,But also
Greg,Just don't pick that one
Greg,
Greg,Guys I lost my gf and I'm scared
Greg,There's a homeless person yelling next to me
Greg,Hlp
Greg,where are you ??
Greg,Down town Salem
Greg,I seriously don't know where she went. And I have her phone
Greg,uh oh
Greg,downtown salem isn't that big. She couldn't've gone too far

Greg,although ivy got a bit nerfed
Greg,Mewtwo buffs
Greg,
Greg,also the fuck is this
Greg,world's least relevant nerf
Greg,LOL
Greg,Actually useless
Greg,Another patch of my characters not being changed
Greg,Works for me
Greg,What projectiles even do 50% ???0
Greg,Probably items/already reflected projectiles
Greg,I'm just greatful that they didn't destroy him
Greg,it might just be cause it lasts so long that you can double reflect with a single input?
Greg,but that's still... kinda dumb
Greg,Tetracon last long but not that long though
Greg,mebe
Greg,"still, I'm hyped about zard getting buffs to ftilt, fsmash (like it wasn't already hella strong when you hit it??), longer-lasting nair, and a stronger fthrow"
Greg,i can confirm that hero is retarded
Greg,but super fun
Greg,imagine slower robin with killpower
Greg,i think hero is mid high tier
Greg,once people learn the matchup
Greg,joker still best character in game
Greg,watching more gameplay of zero kicking ass
Greg,i no longer think he's mid high tier
Greg,i think he's high high tier

Greg,ok i made this cause im bored
Greg,you are underestimating accelerate
Greg,but good tier list
Greg,9/10 would agree
Greg,i also think snooze is A
Greg,accelerate just too fast
Greg,speed is usually good but you simply go too fast for it to be useful
Greg,snooze is mega slow
Greg,and thus more situational
Greg,snooze gives you free kill and you can throw ppl into it
Greg,because its slow
Greg,"also, if you can control accelerate it scary"
Greg,Yeah but Hero's grab sucks ass
Greg,"""if you can"""
Greg,not sure if its really even feasible
Greg,7/10 times i see kameron use snooze it does something stupid
Greg,also i can control it
Greg,That's because it is almost never the correct option to use it
Greg,it's not that hard
Greg,And the times where you do use it
Greg,It was the correct situation to do so
Greg,Conformation bias
Greg,"yea, yea, conformation bias with kameron's tierlist too"
Greg,i mean in all fairness
Greg,the reasoning behind all of the a and s tier spells is that they are consistently very useful in most situations
Greg,except for magic burst which is just ridiculous in certain situations

Greg,smash is starting soon
Greg,also meetup japan 2020? we goin to evo japan boys
Greg,anyone wana watch top 8 with me?
Greg,boys boys boys boys
Greg,circular television. my new latest idea.
Greg,TV's used to be round
Greg,
Greg,are you saying like miniature imax?
Greg,boys boys boys boys
Greg,spherical television my grand newest idea
Greg,no
Greg,terrible idea
Greg,^
Greg,come watch evo with me
Greg,top 8 starting
Greg,I don't know if I've ever seen a smash tournament do winner's side top 8 before loser's side
Greg,they've been doing it all day
Greg,it is a bit weird but it's an evo thing I guess
Greg,This is the first I've watched of evo
Greg,this year
Greg,Last 2 days were lan night + practice for it
Greg,i want raito to lose because duck hunt is lame
Greg,duck hunt is so interesting
Greg,he's not lame
Greg,eh I kinda like raito's duck hunt
Greg,he's got super neat setups
Greg,also this is some hella mediocre commentary
Greg,basically nothing but play-by-play
Greg,yea this commentary is trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Greg,imagine having evo top 8 and not bringing in the full blast zone 
Greg,What is the full blast zone?
Greg,"ee, tk, coney"
Greg,tricast
Greg,they have better commentators for the in-arena stuff
Greg,tk d1 ee
Greg,"not the best there is, but still better than this"
Greg,like both cinnpie and coney are good commentators
Greg,but they fill very similar roles
Greg,eeeeeeeh they're not great
Greg,but yeah definitely part of the problem is that they're both doing nothing but play-by-play commentary
Greg,"no analysis, nothing about player mentality, etc"
Greg,i'm so bored
Greg,by this commentary
Greg,it's great if you want to do something else and just listen tho lol
Greg,not for top 8
Greg,it was a joke
Greg,that you don't need to watch cause you can just listen
Greg,r/woosh
Greg,and they'll tell you everything that happens
Greg,fuck it im watching evo in japanese
Greg,ok japanese commentators are so much more entertaining
Greg,especially when you can make out a few words
Greg,thank you anime
Greg,tweek's PT is so nice
Greg,^
Greg,his zard looks so awkward tho
Greg,but then it goes so hard with the baits
Greg,his baits are so good with zard
Greg,how are they more entertaining when you can only understand like 5 words
Greg,"1, i can consintrate on the game more
2, the commintatiors react better"
Greg,ah
Greg,ayy smash 4 combos still works with fox? i thoiught they removed thoes
Greg,"some do, some don't"
Greg,i thought fair to upair didnt work anymore
Greg,no idea
Greg,it might be a 50/50 now
Greg,also lucina lookin clean
Greg,rip light
Greg,proto's looking super good tho
Greg,zackray leo for 7th monkaW
Greg,hope zack gets bodied

Greg,but I'm still cheering for mkleo

Greg,@Ultimate we should do some fun in house tournies more often
Greg,we'll need a house first
Greg,but yeah I know what you mean
Greg,we should do em like we used to do RoA tourneys
Greg,yeah
Greg,those were super fun
Greg,speaking of we should also play rivals more
Greg,Would we include a nerf mechanic like character banning to encourage less skilled players to attend?
Greg,yeah
Greg,that's what I meant by like our old RoA stuff
Greg,thumb wrestling tourney
Greg,
Greg,if I can get my adapter working with RoA I'm totally down to keep playing it
Greg, Japanese players are gone 
Greg,rip
Greg,The west is the best

Greg,wait no
Greg,bruh
Greg,I'm dumb
Greg,Wait
Greg,3head
Greg,got confused by the winner's/loser's timeslot swap
Greg,lmao
Greg,Japan is west of the US
Greg,"yes, but it's still called the east"
Greg,don't ask
Greg,These terms are from Europe
Greg,Max likes Japan better than the USA
Greg,the east is just extra west 
Greg,
Greg,The terms are from the perspective of Europe
Greg,lol
Greg,Nope
Greg,"Japan west, change my mind"
Greg,do you guys wanna all watch together?
Greg,thats why im in here
Greg,Japan is an honorary western country
Greg,no one is joining pepehands
Greg,I would rather watch alone
Greg,same personally
Greg,"I'd be down for stuff after, but also I'll probably just pass out cause it'll be late"
Greg,i see how it is q.q
Greg,zard's so gross I love it
Greg,he was at like 45%
Greg,he was at 50
Greg,close to 70
Greg,so 60
Greg,i can math
Greg,i'm asian
Greg,ayo commentators not knowing how many jumps zard has
Greg,this is why im watching the japanese dub
Greg,do you know why tweak dropped wario?
Greg,He thought wario struggled too much at approaching and thought PT fit his style better
Greg,ah
Greg,i can see that with wario
Greg,I just remembered I got 13th at a brawl major
Greg,what a game
Greg,Out of how many entrants?
Greg,39 lol
Greg,and I got a bye cause one of my opponents DQ'd
Greg,"still, 13th at a major that was my first brawl tournament, with the second worst character in the game"
Greg,also I love how all these 'blast to the past' clips are just a great reminder of how much better of a spectator game ultimate is
Greg,Also just a better game
Greg,"yeah, but especially from a spectating perspective"
Greg,the gap there is bigger than the gameplay gap imo
Greg,imagine looking at smash 4 with rose tinted glasses
Greg,Smash 4 summarized
Greg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJfLLhnvrWE
Greg,Super Smash Bros. - Bayonetta Victory Theme (HQ)
Greg,The victory theme for Bayonetta in Super Smash Bros 4. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS. IT BELONGS TO NINTENDO.
Greg,doesn't rose-tinted imply I'm looking at it as if it was better?
Greg,r/woosh
Greg,Just counted and apparently I've mained 12 characters throughout my time playing ultimate.
Greg,Benson being unclear and then doing r/woosh when I'm confused is not clever
Greg,This grands should be cool
Greg,i'm rooting for tweak only because he's the underdog
Greg,I like Leo's style better so I'm for him
Greg,and yes zack it's implying that smash 4 was better
Greg,leo's style is closer to mine
Greg,so i might pick up joker and learn some stuff
Greg,I'm rooting for tweek cause PT
Greg,WHAT
Greg,"neither has an evo yet, right?"
Greg,pt tmight be the best character
Greg,"""PT isn't top tier"" ~Zack"
Greg,lol
Greg,I'm reconsidering that position
Greg,lol
Greg,I still think PT isn't the best
Greg,but I'm not as sure as I used to be
Greg,"top tier is something like peach joker pika lucina PT, no idea about the order"
Greg,at least prepatch
Greg,we'll have to see how things shake up postpatch
Greg,You forget Palu and Snake
Greg,i dont think palu is top 5
Greg,He said top tier not top 5
Greg,oh
Greg,tweak is so fkin good
Greg,YO
Greg,*leo
Greg,LEO'S NUUUUUTS
Greg,What a come back
Greg,mk is so fkin good
Greg,also joker busted
Greg,cabbage dog
Greg,reverse 3-0
Greg,tweek looked bad that game
Greg,I think he's shook from the three stock comeback
Greg,shit lookin like me vs zack when i read all his tricks
Greg,poor tweak
Greg,OHHHHHHHHHHHH
Greg,if that hittttttttttttttttt
Greg,TWEAK
Greg,Tweek not tweak
Greg,"he went too deep and basically got hit with the ""well I guess I'm fucked eithe way, might as well"""
Greg,benson pls
Greg,what max said
Greg,I don't think that was intentional
Greg,tewwk
Greg,It was totally intentional
Greg,I mean the sideb was
Greg,but I don't think he wanted to be in the position where he had to go for it
Greg,yeah
Greg,its over
Greg,yea leo has momentum
Greg,tweek won two games
Greg,then mkleo's on five straight
Greg,I saw that
Greg,yeah yeah
Greg,also I'm gonna crack up if the last game of the biggest smash tournament ever is to the tune of route 209
Greg,ill be a miricle if te\wk
Greg,fkit
Greg,typing is hard
Greg,twerk
Greg,joker's recovery is stupidly good
Greg,the japanese commentators ask what happened to tweak
Greg,tweek*
Greg,he was doing so well
Greg,poor tweek
Greg,ggs
Greg,hot damn
Greg,that was nutty
Greg,tweek almost stole it lol
Greg,Great grand finals
Greg,that was a good grands
Greg,wow dude he looks so emotional 
Greg,can we talk about that loser's run from mkleo tho
Greg,that was like eight or nine sets
Greg,wow that was a good guess
Greg,"it was literally 8 people, 9 sets if you count grands as two sets"
Greg,proto has a new fan

Greg,
Greg,k
Greg,oh shit what happened in leff vs salem?
Greg,some beef went down
Greg,it basically went down like this
Greg,Game 1 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is behind the whole time but makes a comeback with vine whip) Game 2 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is winning but chokes and loses) Game 3 (PT vs Hero: Leffen wins fairly convincingly)
Greg,sasuage man went to go say hello to the big leaf
Greg,but then the leaf turned sideways
Greg,then sasuage man went all hero mode

mdva: facial hair weak"
Greg,junebug tho

Greg,fair
Greg,This might be the lamest I've ever seen hbox play
Greg,he really is killing melee
Greg,ban puff
Greg,no meme
Greg,also zain just looked so defeated after game 2 ended
Greg,man poor amsa has to fight falcon right into peach
Greg,that said he did 3-0 s2j so we'll see how this goes
Greg,there are too many lame characters in melee
Greg,matches like yoshi peach and puff marth are too slow for a top eight
Greg,yoshi vs floaties is fairly boring
Greg,yoshi is boring when amsa is losing and is thus forced to camp
Greg,he honestly does the same stuff hbox does but amsa is more likeable so people dont care
Greg,also it looks cooler
Greg,in all fairness tho llod is the one camping
Greg,llod zain losers semis maybe
Greg,none is sick
Greg,let's go none
Greg,my stream froze partway through the zain none set and I got this great screenshot just as none's getting fsmashed off stage

Greg,rite

Greg,Lol base game wonderwoman is tier 2 fuckers
Greg,tier 2 is shit tier
Greg,It's in reverse
Greg,"6 is higest, 1 is lowest"
Greg,you buffoon
Greg,Who tf counts up
Greg,These people
Greg,the game is designed so you can play multiple heroes aslong as their tier adds up too 6 or less
Greg,
Greg,I just played better then I think I ever have in Ultimate. I was 3 stocking or nearly 3 stocking everyone I met in elite smash.
Greg,pog
Greg,"@Ultimate After years of research, I present to you my Ike matchup chart. Note: I've only played some of these matchups a single digit number of times so they may be wrong."
Greg,Ike doesn't have a plus 1 against cloud
Greg,I just suck at edge guarding
Greg,Plus i have blade beam
Greg,That can kill you at zero
Greg,On top of that i have a better neutral
Greg,Cloud has a plus 1 against ike
Greg,I also think ike loses to pit
Greg,Eeeeh I dunno about that
Greg,Nair oos hits ike
Greg,That can lead to fair and boom offstage
Greg,Plus arrows
Greg,Dead ikr
Greg,Nair oos wont hit unless crap spacing by ike
Greg,It can also antiair him
Greg,Also that combo only works at low percents
Greg,Also only preemptively cause he outranges and outspeeds pit
Greg,If you can get him off stage its doable but its super hard to win neutral at all
Greg,And he gets more off any given neutral win
Greg,Ike pit is such a fun mu.
Greg,Idk bout dark pit
Greg,It's worse cause bad arrows
Greg,So he kinda just has no place where he can wreck ike
Greg,He just sorta loses all the time instead of just most o the time
Greg,Im pretty sure fair beats his quickdraw
Greg,Imo pit ike is 55 45 respectfully

Greg,No
Greg,It is super easy
Greg,please do it
Greg,"This method seems to work great, I will be using it to create the actual bracket shortly. Those without a challonge account are highly encouraged to make one so they can participate. I just had Ava make one and it took her like 30 seconds."
Greg,
Greg,I'll continue this meme bracket just for fun
Greg,lightning fast rounds
Greg,You will need to refresh the page each time the round advances
Greg,"@Homies @Master Memers @Advanced Memers My voting bracket is finally here, featuring all of your finest submissions! I will be posting a link to the bracket both here and in the voting bracket channel. A challonge account is required to vote so make sure you get one of those. Don't worry, they are really easy and quick to make. Each round will be available for an indeterminate amount of time, so make sure you vote whenever you can. I will advance the round whenever it seems like everyone who would vote, has voted already. I have given a new role to everyone who gave suggestions in the submissions channel that I will use to update you guys on the progress of the voting bracket. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, remove the role from yourself. Alternatively, if you want the role and didn't get it, feel free to add it to yourself or ask a master memer to do it for you. Have fun everyone!"

Greg,Bruh
Greg,
Greg,"Goodbye, free time"
Greg,I may be getting it as well in a few weeks
Greg,you should at least try a different fire emblem game a little bit first
Greg,"just to see if the gameplay is at all up your alley, cause three houses is pretty pricy"
Greg,I just dropped ninety canadian pesos
Greg,(tax included)
Greg,"aight boys and possibly girls who have three houses, how's the difficulty in this game? ie should I play on normal or hard"
Greg,Hard pussy
Greg,
Greg,(I don't own the game)
Greg,naw I ended up doing normal+classic
Greg,Bro
Greg,You didn't even wait for a response
Greg,I waited like five minutes
Greg,you waited 3
Greg,shhh
Greg,maybe less
Greg,It was 2 minutes since my message
Greg,I'm impatient okay
Greg,jeez
Greg,Normal is too easy
Greg,From everyone iv talked to
Greg,welp too late now
Greg,Just restart
Greg,although I'm still on the prologue
Greg,so yeah
Greg,anyways if you think hard is too hard you can downgrade later
Greg,but you can never upgrade
Greg,"also side note, if I'm restarting I want to know the name of that weird chick who asks what my name is"
Greg,"so that I can give myself the same name and see if she still goes ""all y'all humans got some wack ass names"""
Greg,Sothis
Greg,I highly doubt you'll get away with it but you can try
Greg,also it'll definitely make dialogue weird eventually
Greg,I feel like its just gonna be like
Greg,"""No"""
Greg,but w/e I'll figure stuff out with pronouns cause I'm gonna be a dude
Greg,"pfft she still goes ""I shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names"""
Greg,come on nintendo
Greg,Wait are you actually allowed to do that
Greg,What is she if not a human?
Greg,wacl
Greg,wack*
Greg,based on her appearance and a few little details I've picked up Imma assume she's a dragon
Greg,also I'm 90% sure she automatically has the same birthday as you
Greg,cause she definitely comments on that one
Greg,"also, don't tell me, but if she's eventually a playable character and romance option I'm gonna crack up"
Greg,just for the theoretical
Greg,"""Do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded wife?""
""I do.""
""And do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded husband?""
""I do."""
Greg,aight they don't even change sothis' lines if your name is also sothis
Greg,"maaaaan it made my weird friendship counter thing with Sothis decrease because I took the ""guess I'll die"" dialogue option"
Greg,this has now made me afraid of choosing all the snarky options
Greg,gg everyone gone
Greg,i keep falling asleep in ma chair
Greg,just go to ur bed before you fall asleep

Greg, @Mr. Airplane
Greg,2 bird 1 stone
Greg,bruh wrench'd won shine
Greg,good shit
Greg,"leffen vs moky's about to be on, this should be good"
Greg,or leffen's gonna slaughter him
Greg,jesus moky is fast
Greg,he's nuts
Greg,side note who the hell is Kevin Maples
Greg,and why is he in top 8
Greg,everything moky does is a clip
Greg,that game was so spaghetti
Greg,"mostly leffen, but a little moky too"
Greg,game five tho
Greg,MOOOOKY
Greg,YOU'RE NUUUUTS
Greg,    
Greg,LETS GO
Greg,he SD'd super low and still went nuts
Greg,that second last stock was unreal
Greg,THE MENTAL
Greg,leffen's already tweeted lol
Greg,that was so fast
Greg,all around that might have been the best fox ditto I've seen since armada retired
Greg,can leffen ever complement his opponent
Greg,that'd be nice
Greg,https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439331114397698
Greg,Played like shit but still better than I expected with no warmup. Very unlikely I'm playing losers tomorrow. Ggs all
Greg,what a child
Greg,he's been super salty all day
Greg,
Greg,Bruh
Greg,"also, it's gonna be hbox vs ibdw, and moky vs winner of sfat s2j"
Greg,I win my first top 16 match
Greg,moky could make grands winner's side if ibdw wins
Greg,i think ibdw would win a fox ditto
Greg,if sfat beats s2j i could see ibdw winning the whole thing
Greg,yeah
Greg,"I wasn't saying moky would be favoured to make winner's side grands, just that it's not improbable"
Greg,like 1/3 maybe
Greg,@Mr. Airplane https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439884292743168
Greg,"Don't get me wrong, mokys sick and has been putting in work, he def deserves winners top 8 way more. Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"
Greg,
Greg,i mean gave him credit after giving like 8 johns and threatening to dq himself
Greg,he's been threatening to DQ himself all day lol
Greg,like several days actually
Greg,"""Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"" and its an underhanded complement"
Greg,I mean they both SD'd a bunch
Greg,and I don't think that's so bad honestly
Greg,like it's a bit john-y but w/e
Greg,and I think it's fair given his SDs game 4
Greg,I'd be hella salty
Greg,I personally have no issue with the way leffen talks. It seems he uses a variant of the Max mindset.
Greg,eh he's been really salty in general at shine
Greg,"like zero respect for anyone who beats him, puts all the blame on stuff that... he controls, at least to a degree"
Greg,every ult bracket he blames matchups he doesn't know
Greg,and like yeah he's trying to learn stuff but at a certain point you just gotta suck it up
Greg,"You've just described the Max mindset. In short ""Its always my own fault""."
Greg,That is a great mindset for a winner
Greg,yeah but I'm saying he's not doing that
Greg,"he's blaming it on other stuff, like lack of sleep, or bad scheduling, or not knowing the matchups"
Greg,Blaming SD's or playing bad or lack of matchup knowledge are all things that you did wrong
Greg,he's putting the responsability on everything but himself and his opponent
Greg,bad scheduling is the only thing you listed that is not his own fault
Greg,okay but the sleep thing is a huge john
Greg,Have you tried flying 6 timezones or so away and then having to play 13 hours in one day with no sleep
Greg,yes but he chose that
Greg,Seems hard and like a legitimate excuse
Greg,it's like blaming that you're playing a low tier
Greg,"like yeah, it's a disadvantage"
Greg,but you chose the disadvantage
Greg,he didn't have to play both games
Greg,You can choose to switch mains. You don't choose to be born European.
Greg,fly in earlier
Greg,only play one game
Greg,he was considering it
Greg,"and he doesn't get to both decide he's in the position to play both games despite everything else, then when he loses blame those things"
Greg,Its better than people dropping our constantly to preserve a reputation. Imagine a world like that.
Greg,I'm glad he entered both games
Greg,but that's not what I'm arguing about
Greg,"I don't think the move to preserve his reputation would have been to only enter one, it would have been to not bitch about things that were at least partially under his control when things don't go his way"
Greg,By reputation I mean ranking and future seeding
Greg,but that's not what we're talking about
Greg,we're talking about his behaviour and mentality
Greg,I'm saying I would rather people stay in bracket and john when they lose instead of drop out whenever they think they are not playing their absolute best to preserve their ranking.
Greg,"I'm normally on his side for a lot of things, but I think that the sequence of events of:

1) call out flaws with tournament
2) suggest how he could handle them better
3) not follow his own suggestions
4) bitch about the things he didn't avoid

is not a good look"
Greg,"once you've reached 3), you're not really in a position to complain about it"
Greg,I really don't even understand how his actions could be interpreted as points 2 and 3 but whatever.
Greg,"he goes ""I should drop out of melee so that my sleep schedule and all that is intact cause I'm not really feeling it, plus fuck shine for making such a dumb schedule so their tourney should suffer for it."" That's #2. Playing anyway at the cost of his sleep and proper warmup for either game is #3. Blaming the tournament structure and his lack of sleep and warmup for his losses is #4"
Greg,"my point isn't that he shouldn't have entered both games, it's that once he's committed to that, knowing full well all the issues it would cause him, I don't think he's entitled to complain about it"
Greg,"again, it's like choosing a low tier. Yes, playing a low tier disadvantaged you, but you knew what you were getting yourself into, so suck it up or change characters. Don't blame the game for not making your character good"
Greg,Welcome to 2019 everybody. A world in which a minecraft parody song by Captain Sparklez is the top trending song of the month. Lol how did this happen.

Greg,He's super vulnerable
Greg,Banjo sucks
Greg,
Greg,I don't see him being any better than bottom 10 characters
Greg,Maybe even bottom 3
Greg,It's wack cause everyone on Reddit is like wow his recovery is so good
Greg,But it clearly isn't
Greg,I tested with Ava yesterday and down throw into side B can be mashed out of well into kill%
Greg,Yeah he also sucks at killing

Greg,Forever
Greg,Evil
Greg,I had the weirdest discussion with my housemates today
Greg,we spent like 45 minutes discussing one question
Greg,"""Can a person be taller than they are old?"""
Greg,any baby
Greg,done
Greg,it spiralled off into like four hours of weird random stuff and it was a great time
Greg,"Chris, explain"
Greg,because the deeper you get into the specifics the more insane this conversation can become
Greg,babies are 0 years of age
Greg,babies are taller than 0 of any measurement for length
Greg,Therefore yes
Greg,A person can be taller than their age
Greg,yeah that was me and one other guy's argument
Greg,"but it got into a convoluted discussion of the meaning of age, weird semantics, and we eventually ended up talking about quantum physics"
Greg,Interesting
Greg,...
Greg,...
Greg,"basically one guy's point was that age cannot be zero, since its the amount of time that has passed since something came into existence, and if no time has passed, its age just flat out doesn't exist rather than being zero"
Greg,"Well okay, even if you are one year old, you are probably taller than one of any significant form of measurement"
Greg,Or once it does begin to exist after itnhas been born
Greg,yeah but no kind of measurement was specified
Greg,It's age will be somewhere between 0 and 1
Greg,Therefore my original statement holds true aswell
Greg,"also the fact that time and distance aren't really comparable, regardless of unit"
Greg,which is how we ended up in quantum physics
Greg,I mean I guess but in the context we can assume we are just comparing absolute values
Greg,can we though
Greg,do you even know the context
Greg,the context was wack as hell
Greg,
Greg,it came from a badly translated article about yao ming's daughter
Greg,how we got to that is another story
Greg,but also it's late and I should sleep
Greg,so gnight all
Greg,Goodnight
Greg,I was typing periods to test my lag since I wasn't able to send messages
Greg,Those periods took several minutes to actually register as sent
Greg,alright played a banjo online

Greg,"i still got 17th because i won in winners, but i coulda done much better"
Greg,"had my first kingston weekly since april 2018 yesterday:
ultimate (https://kingstonsmash.challonge.com/KU33): 38 people, I got 9th, but only because I lost to 4th seed (who won the whole thing), and then immediately got the top seed cause he sandbagged with banjo in winner's. Looking at who I would have had to fight if I he hadn't sandbagged, I would have had three people I've never lost to, so I probably should have gotten 4th. Also Lucas is a super wack matchup that I've never played so I'm glad I beat both the ones I fought.
melee (https://challonge.com/raw0xlb4): smaller tournament because there's a bigger event today, got 4/17, lost to 1st and 2nd, and all close games (0-2 for both, but still mostly last-hit games). Also, my marth is not ready for sheik. Beat a pr'd sheik where he jv3'd my marth and then I double two-stocked him with samus. Got 2 PR wins so I think I'm well on my way to this season's PR.
various traditional fighters that didn't have brackets: I'm nutty at unist even on a controller I'm not used to. Guilty gear is really fun but also really fucking hard, and I'm gonna be really upset if I end up with yet another fighting game where I hate the visual design of my best character."
Greg,"now today I've got a bigger melee tournament that should have more of the PR (yesterday only had half the PR), and more people in general, and a proper unist bracket that I think I'll be able to place in the money for, so long as I can stay somewhat consistent with a weird control scheme"
Greg,When my life is crumbling apart but it’s my birthday so I gotta play it cool 
Greg,
Greg,@Ultimate Someone fight me
Greg,I can't seem to join voice in here so I'll be in frostbite 1
Greg,tfw you dont have frostbyte 1
Greg,@Galf
Greg,Going to a tournament wish me luck. Also what character should I play @Ultimate ?
Greg,Banjo Kazooie @Max
Greg,No
Greg,Pokemon trainer
Greg,Then why ask
Greg,
Greg,Welp I did terribly in melee
Greg,"Between pools and bracket, 1-4"
Greg,Mostly respectable losses but I feel like I should have won 3 of them
Greg,"On the flip side, second in unist"
Greg,Got the reset bracket into get 3-0d classic
Greg,well zack
Greg,looks like its time to come back and play me in ultimate instead
Greg,i lost to two pts so gotta grind 
Greg,I'm 1-1 right now. Likely fighting a Samus next
Greg,ya boi made five entire dollars from UNIST today
Greg,and only spent 14 on the tournament and food
Greg,and honestly I'm more happy that I didn't get 3rd than that I got 2nd
Greg,because getting 3rd would have involved losing to someone who started playing unist last night
Greg,he brought me to game 5 last round
Greg,Basically double 3 stocked the Samus. My Palu is looking clean.
Greg,Next match is the winner of an inkling ditto. Anyone got any tips for this matchup?
Greg,@Max just play bowser 4head
Greg,@Sak von Sak wanna jame jamer?
Greg,Beat the inkling but lost to the same wolf player I lost to round 1 rip.
Greg,Went 3-2
Greg,Got 7th
Greg,Got seeded terrible since no one knew who I was so I'm satisfied with my performance. Aside from 1 game of ike I went all Palu.
Greg,i think
Greg,bowser is actually bad vs heavies
Greg,10/10 would recommend abandoned 1800s Masonic cemeteries
Greg,Bro
Greg,Bro
Greg,We deadass were leaving and heard laughing around us
Greg,We looked it up later and it's common for people to be chased out and get scratches from a witch who was hung and buried there
Greg,And we all thought we were good but we got home and one of my friend checked his back and he had a long scratch mark down his back
Greg,That cemetery is the #1 most haunted place in oregon
Greg,Are you sure he didn't just get scratched on a tree branch or something?
Greg,It was 3 scratches going sideways across his lower back
Greg,It didn't look like a scratch from a bush
Greg,And one of our other friends refused to go because he had gotten a deep scratch the last time he went
Greg,MonkaW
Greg,We were chilling and my stomach just dropped and I told them we had to get out of there before 12
Greg,I had a feeling bad shit would happen if we were in there when it hit 12
Greg,It was wack
Greg,Just checked yesterdays bracket and I actually got 5th not 7th
Greg,nice
Greg,Guy who double eliminated me got 2nd

Greg,How about poker?
Greg,Come play this
Greg,Maybe poker later
Greg,This game is really fun
Greg,I like the rabbit character
Greg,Well come play
Greg,
Greg,I'm home in 1.5 hours
Greg,The game is not fun but the art on that particular character's cards is rather amusing
Greg,@Max
Greg,I'll play poker
Greg,Poker?
Greg,Ayy
Greg,Let's go
Greg,Max I read a short book on poker
Greg,What @Trapezoider ?
Greg,So I don't suck now
Greg,I mean I still suck just not as bad
Greg,I've done a fair bit of reading on poker so I like to think I'm pretty decent when I'm full tryharding
Greg,But doing that means folding like 70%+ of hands so I rarely do
Greg,It just becomes boring for everyone
Greg,Pls play
Greg,You're just folding most of the time anyways
Greg,What the heck
Greg,truth
Greg,Chris I'll play as soon as I'm home
Greg,Your game then poker
Greg,I mean is that not pro poker anyways
Greg,foding 70% sounds about right
Greg,"Like I said, that is the correct way to play if you want to win, it just is more fun to play a lot of hands."
Greg,according to my dad i'm weird in that i play the same whether or not money is involved
Greg,I would never play poker for real money
Greg,i mean even for somehting liek 5 bucks
Greg,I am opposed to gambling
Greg,fair enough i suppose
Greg,@Trapezoider we playin poker soon or wha t
Greg,Did y’all end up actually playing poker
Greg,Hello
Greg,No we did not
Greg,I thought I would be home sooner
Greg,But repairing my window took longer than expected
Greg,Smh
Greg,@Zain Can you use your mode powers to get me a massive CSV of every message sent in chillin ?
Greg,I'm not sure that is possible
Greg,This is so sad
Greg,I'm learning about language models
Greg,and I wanted to train a net to generate text that is basically the average of frostbite
Greg,
Greg,Just go highlight everything
Greg,
Greg,I would also like to see some data science with the chat
Greg,you could probably make a bot that would just scrape the entirety of a channel
Greg,Like who has sent the most messages etc.
Greg,"I'm not positive cause I""ve never worked with discord's api 'n stuff, but it should be doable"
Greg,Its totally possible i recalla  friend of mine doing something similar
Greg,not for frostbite obvs but
Greg,Can you reach out to him and find out how
Greg,I could train something by the end of the day
Greg,It would be like the olive garden commercials
Greg,sounds neat
Greg,@Trapezoider just ctrl+a 
Greg,>.<
Greg,
Greg,oh god
Greg,what have they done to discord light theme
Greg,
Greg,I don't use that shit
Greg,they made it so ugly
Greg,like soooo ugly
Greg,Insinuating that it wasn't already ugly
Greg,What did they change?
Greg,they removed the darker parts and just made everything the lighter version so now there's no more contrast and logical grouping of things that go together and everything just sorta blends together and looks awful
Greg,and I don't know why they thought it was an improvement
Greg,my best guess is they've just decided to drive the last holdouts over to dark theme and then delete light mode
Greg,OH ITS AWFUL

Greg,"Millennials, also known as Generation Y (or simply Gen Y), are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted definition. Millennials are sometimes referred to as ""echo boomers"" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The characteristics of millennials vary by region and by individual, and the group experiences a variety of social and economic conditions, but they are generally marked by their coming of age in the Information Age, and are comfortable in their usage of digital technologies and social media."

Greg,He's cool but he's no beghoul
Greg,
Greg,"bored between classes so I made a tier list, come give me shit for my shit opinions"
Greg,why does it only go to C tier
Greg,because the game's well enough balanced that it doesn't need to go further down
Greg,"I've seen games that don't go below B tier (shoutouts to UNIST, although technically it has Enkidu tier, containing just Enkidu, because he is terrible. Still got 5th at evo though.)"
Greg,I'll have my tier list out in a few days
Greg,So I will refrain from commenting for now
Greg,cloud needs to be lower
Greg,he's in b- tier
Greg,there's a reason why the 2 best cloud players are dropping cloud and why i'm taking a break from smash
Greg,"eeeh I don't think he's that low, but I might have put him a bit high. He's still got good tools and I feel like he mops up a solid chunk of the characters below him"
Greg,but there's just characters who are more or less better cloud
Greg,what tools? when all his moves have 0 priority and trade with almost anything
Greg,"they aren't that bad, and they're pretty safe, if not plus. Also he has solid juggling and deals hella damage, and always has a comeback/blowup factor because his callout tools (fsmash, anything with limit) are really strong"
Greg,UPAIR LOSES AND TRADES WITH BOWSER NAIR
Greg,FUCKING BOWSER NAIR
Greg,you can't tell me cloud has good shit
Greg,when i've played him the most
Greg,bowser nair is amazing what are you talking about
Greg,everything loses to bowser nair
Greg,barring insane disjoints
Greg,hense my point. cloud sucks
Greg,"which cloud doesn't have anymore, he only has moderate disjooints"
Greg,losing to something that almost everyone else also loses to does not make your character bad
Greg,^
Greg,Benson your point there made no sense
Greg,my point is that cloud's juggling game isnt great
Greg,he struggles to kill
Greg,and his disjoints suck
Greg,his moves have no priority
Greg,and his recovery is bad
Greg,I'd like to point out that everything you just mentioned except the recovery thing applies to the entire chunk immediately above him
Greg,"duck hunt,  the links, g&w, shulk"
Greg,shulk at least has decent disjoints but also his juggling sucks
Greg,and the poor boy can't kill without putting himself hugely at risk
Greg,he has smash art
Greg,at least that helps
Greg,"which puts him hugely at risk as well, it's terrible for closing out games or making comebacks"
Greg,also a great way to lose leads
Greg,"but yes, he's a better character than cloud, which is why he's near the top of the tier as opposed to the bottom"
Greg,cloud has a hard time dealing with people who constantly run away + sometimes can't kill until he lands a unstale move or throw at 220%
Greg,on top of that his grab sucks balls
Greg,yeah he's got issues
Greg,but so does everyone at this point in the list
Greg,"and he's able to safely poke with kill moves, which is a big deal"
Greg,unless it's perfectly spaced in which it only hits the shield and not aimed at the opponent then yes
Greg,but other than that
Greg,no
Greg,his bair is safe only if you spot dodge
Greg,and his fair loses to fast oos options
Greg,also parrying is a thing
Greg,which makes bair unsafe
Greg,which is his safest move
Greg,yeah but parrying makes... basically everything unsafe
Greg,so it's not a super valid issue
Greg,@Max @Sak von Sak @TheRainbowpixelz @The Rona anyone down for some smash
Greg,wanna play some ike
Greg,"got another lecture in 20 minutes, I'd be down after that tho"
Greg,just got back from class
Greg,so in like an hour and a half or so
Greg,i have class later 
Greg,at 5
Greg,also kameron come shit on my tier list
Greg,I'll play
Greg,your tier list trash
Greg,or join the argument about how I placed cloud
Greg,cloud sucks and is bottom of mid tier
Greg,"you put mega man, zss, chrom, ness, gren, pac, shulk way too low"
Greg,"I don't think zss deserves to be any higher imo, and the rest might be a bit better but I feel like results on them are all dropping off (except shulk)"
Greg,imagine thinking mega man and pac results are dropping off
Greg,I may have just not seen any
Greg,kameme won an s tier 
Greg,oh
Greg,solo mm?
Greg,p much
Greg,mostly megaman
Greg,hm might move him to like around pac then
Greg,bowser being above pac and mega man is a joke
Greg,megaman is better than bowser
Greg,not sure about pac
Greg,well :/ it depends  on the mu
Greg,they are not characters I know a ton about
Greg,it wasn't exactly an extensively researched tier list
Greg,most of megaman and pac is theory crafting
Greg,judging the megaman placing by japanese players at evo megaman and duck hunt have gone up in my tier lsit
Greg,but there's still not enough information via games to justify if they are actually good or not
Greg,"we'll see, my assumption is that like most not-super-popular characters that are being labbed out, there'll be a bunch of new tech found, their results will shoot up, then people will start figuring out the matchup and the results will drop a bit, but still be noticeably higher than initially"
Greg,"so it's hard to say at what point any characters like that are, especially if you're me and haven't even noticed the good results"
Greg,you've seen that duck hunt and how much safe pressure it can put out
Greg,with pac-man ive already seen people learn how to play around his neutral b galiga
Greg,we just have to wait and see more to fully get a grasp on these zoners

Greg,Vote Now! [Dig a ditch (in moderate weather)] [Do Research]
Greg,thoughts?
Greg,Melee might be more fun with only battlefield tbh
Greg,id be down to ban puff
Greg,That would be even better
Greg,Banning things to make the game more fun is perfectly fine in my opinion
Greg,Like TF2 6s does
Greg,tf2 6s wasnt really banning things
Greg,it was building a competitive game from the ground up
Greg,If heavy had GRU and his slowing minigun legal he would have seen play
Greg,it was a 'constructive ruleset'
Greg,"When hungrybox is in attendance, Ultimate top 8 probably has a faster average game speed. How depressing that one character can slow down an entire game."
Greg,Just ban Hungrybox
Greg,when he is maybe gonna lose he plays lame
Greg,
Greg,puff encourages non-interaction
Greg,Characters should not have multiple jumps
Greg,Meta knight had the same issue of air camping
Greg,air camping inherently limits the options of your opponent making it bad to approach
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,What does that mean
Greg,It was listing his most common moves for neutral wins and kills.
Greg,@Mr. Airplane do you not want to do research?
Greg,dreamland is basically impossible for marth vs puff cause pivot tipper doesnt kill until the percents dont work anymore
Greg,It connects and kills during an 8% window

Greg,"It depends on what the fitness challenge is. Maybe its ""Who can achieve the highest proportional increase in weight lifting"" or ""Who can keep the highest average heart rate over the month??"" IDK

Greg,this is some wack gamer mouse design
Greg,but it's apparently a crazy good mouse and only $50
Greg,p sure its to reduce weight by using less material
Greg,could be wrong tho
Greg,yeah
Greg,but it looks so gamer
Greg,I bought it
Greg,(current mouse is dying)
Greg,which is weird cause my mouse i can put extra weights in to make ti heavier
Greg,which i do
Greg,I actually like lighter mice
Greg,doesn't have the same heft but also it just feels super free and easy
Greg,idk for me it feels like i can be more accurate with a heavier mouse
Greg,prob cause im adjusted to it now tho
Greg,also I do a lot of my mousing with my fingers and wrist rather than my arm
Greg,so light is a lot easier
Greg,I say as i just overshot a program on my taskbar and opened steam
Greg,lol

Greg,Okay the ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion is wack
Greg,
Greg,Are you talking about the TV series or the movie?
Greg,Theres a movie?
Greg,:0
Greg,Im talking about the TV series
Greg,"There is a movie ""End of Evangelion"""
Greg,That fixes the ending
Greg,FR???
Greg,yes
Greg,THANK GOD
Greg,I was kind of dissatisfied 
Greg,you should still watch the zero budget TV series end though because its funny
Greg,Thanks for letting me know buddy
Greg,It was really zero budget?
Greg,no
Greg,I thought this was supposed to be intentionally artsy
Greg,but they did have some problems
Greg,it was not meant to be like this
Greg,Thats good to know
Greg,yeah they flat out ran out of money
Greg,oof
Greg,which is hilarious to me since it ended up being one of the most profitable anime franchises ever
Greg,just... not during production
Greg,it's weird how iconic that show is
Greg,like I bet if you played the theme song
Greg,most people would recognize it and go
Greg,hmmm I know this song but not where it is from
Greg,"There is a video called something like ""Can you live entirely off Evangelion Merchandise?"". There is so much of it that you basically can."
Greg,spoilers
Greg,I'm reading online
Greg,"and people are saying ""They ran out of money"" is a myth"
Greg,can someone source this please?
Greg,They had problems with the original ending being too similar to a terrorist attack and thought it would be in poor taste to release it is the long answer.
Greg,"honestly it's not that weird that the show ended up being as iconic as it was, at least within anime. It kinda revolutionized an entire genre and brought a ton of new ideas and directions into the medium and is a huge part of why anime is the way it is, but despite that no one's quite managed to replicate what made it work. The weird thing is that it's so recognizable to people who don't know much of anything about anime"
Greg,facts
Greg,"I didn't know what the show was until gigukk made the ""Basically, Netflix's Evangelion"""
Greg,But before seeing that I had inadvertently seen tons of references to the show around the internet
Greg,It was a good watch
Greg,Time for the film
Greg,dayum I've got the ESL new york finals in the background and apparently EG just beat Astralis 16-3 on Astralis' pick?
Greg,let's go NA
Greg,"Honestly, I didn't even know EG had a CSGO team."
Greg,they bought NRG's roster
Greg,"like, a week ago"
Greg,I only know about it because they keep mentioning it on commentary

Greg,@Ultimate ?
Greg,There's a common concept that to be really good at something you first have to suck at it and fail a bunch
Greg,However usually people who end up really good at something start fairly good at the thing
Greg,Yes
Greg,So it's a dumb and ultimately harmful concept
Greg,You are only getting half of that right
Greg,"Your ability to master any skill is pretty much directly related to your IQ. 

Two dudes start learning a game for instance. Jim's IQ is 130 while Bob's is 100. 

If they both practice 8 hours a day, by the end of the month Jim is pretty much guaranteed to be way better than Bob. 

When they started they both sucked and failed to play the game well. What differentiates them is the Jim was able to learn and reduce his failures/attempts WAY faster than Bob."
Greg,TLRD: To be good at something you do have to fail... BUT your number of failures will be vastly lower than someone with a lower IQ and you will master the skill quicker.
Greg,Okay get the fuck out of here. You did not just start typing the MOMENT I open discord @Mr. Airplane
Greg,
Greg,MonkaW
Greg,
Greg,I am watching you
Greg,I mean uh
Greg,D:
Greg,monkaS
Greg,@Trapezoider so because I picked up melee quicker than you I have a higher iq right?
Greg,jed actual 
Greg,Yes
Greg,@Jed
Greg,Apparently reaction time is indicative of higher IQ as well
Greg,I wouldn't be surprised if you have more brain points
Greg,Oh wack
Greg,
Greg,Alright everyone. I have returned to my name
Greg,But the Baron...
Greg,How will he sruvive without his assistant
Greg,The Baron is on vacation in Fiji
Greg,Ah understandable
Greg,lmao I'm boutta go skydiving
Greg,try not to die
Greg,I will
Greg,Skydiving is idiotic in my opinion
Greg,Why
Greg,cause I was like hey what if I went skydiving
Greg,It's probably safer than driving a car
Greg,oh
Greg,Not you
Greg,lmao yeah I said that to my mom
Greg,I mean is true
Greg,Just cause something seems scary
Greg,Doesn't mean it is scary
Greg,I feel like you should do things you think are scary
Greg,/dangerous
Greg,Yeah Mrs.Max is afraid of flying even though its statistically safer than driving
Greg,He means my Mom ^

Greg,so many formulas to memorize
Greg,I've never had an open book test
Greg,Is that normal?
Greg,depends
Greg,it's fairly common in courses like this one where there's a ton of formulas to memorize that aren't as important as actually knowing how to apply them
Greg,zack stop messaging us

Greg,
Greg,oh wow that looks really complicated and professsional
Greg,yeah
Greg,he's mad talented
Greg,and also just works really hard
Greg,yep hard work and a lotta time dedication can get you pretty far
Greg,but you also have to be smart about it. I spent years making super slow progress because I was really stupid about how I was going about drawing
Greg,Yeah but I mean for really skilled artists like me our talents just develope naturally
Greg,I guess that's just absolute savants

Greg,"So as many of you know I've started a new campaign and for this one i wanted to have an introduction so that there could something in between starting situation and when the players actually started to play. When i was going about writing this i said to myself it would really suck if i were to fuck this up when i have to read it so why not just record it and play it for the players over some music. I decided ultimately to not do that and it went perfectly fine but while i did not put into practice my recording idea i did however record 30 clips of me trying to record this introduction and on all of the 29 clips i failed. I ended up getting pretty mad the last one in this video was perfect, but all the rest are just me raging so i asked some people if they wanted to see it and they said they did so here for your enjoyment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YFx7qlhq0&feature=youtu.be"

Greg,month at the most
Greg,bruh what do you even do while in solitary confinement
Greg,like do they give you books to read or something
Greg,nope
Greg,at least for the most part
Greg,so do you just sit there
Greg,yes sir
Greg,i wouldnt do it for more than like a week then
Greg,i think i would start going insane after that
Greg,like i get mega bored during a 4 hour car ride

Greg,yeet
Greg,sheik is so bad in melee
Greg,actually awful recovery
Greg,m2k beat hbox
Greg,hype
Greg,Plup beat Salem lololol
Greg,he took game 1 vs tweek
Greg,ohhh
Greg,Is it on stream?
Greg,no
Greg,he lost 3-1 lol
Greg,plup and armada both placed 17th
Greg,mew2king really is the coolest marth
Greg,Did leo not got to big house
Greg,no
Greg,Melee saved
Greg,Praise almighty Mang0
Greg,Zain is so good what the heck
Greg,that girl sceaming in the background fucked over leffen
Greg,i would be hella tilted
Greg,That's the mang0
Greg,Long live melee
Greg,
Greg,Yes
Greg,ay I broke my 9th place ultimate curse
Greg,by getting 13th
Greg,still counts
Greg,I was about to type a congratulatory message...
Greg,(also in all fairness this was a monthly with a bunch of out-of-town people)
Greg,(so there were like twenty more people than usual)
Greg,King's Court?
Greg,yeah
Greg,Big House melee was great to watch because Hbox got eliminated early
Greg,"I did maintain my UNIST 2nd place curse though, so I got $5"
Greg,which failed to cover the $17 I spent on entering four tournaments
Greg,also yeah I'm sad I missed top 8
Greg,from looking at the bracket it looks nuts
Greg,What other two did you enter?
Greg,"melee singles, ult singles, ult dubs, unist"
Greg,"also tekken, which was free"
Greg,game is wack
Greg,"""So I jump into the air, you see? and then I fly down at you?""
""Yeah.""
""It's an overhead. But technically it's unblockable. But it can be blocked low."""
Greg,???
Greg,ayo what
Greg,zackray's playing corrin
Greg,he lost
Greg,yeah he got pretty booped
Greg,but not much more on corrin than on joker
Greg,nairo's playing DK what is this tournament
Greg,Zackray in summit
Greg,Game and Watch looks super annoying to play against
Greg,Up B and his smash attacks are so spammable
Greg,And up air
Greg,alright boys
Greg,Im hype
Greg,I just spent an hour
Greg,Trying to find a copy of this textbook that is $300

Greg,
Greg,Uhh
Greg,My game is fucked
Greg,Guys is it just me or are kamerons drawings getting better? 
Greg,how dare you. Kameron's art is already at peak perfection. It cannot ascend any higher.
Greg,Honestly
Greg,every time kameron draws the bar for perfection simply moves up

Greg,Dolphin Emulator 2019.10.08 - 00.34.37.03.DVR Trim
Greg,oh hey indivisible came out today
Greg,must... finish.... assignment... first
Greg,"bleh I'm strongly considering just not handing in this assignment. It's only worth ~6% of my mark, and as far as I've been able to tell I'm following the instructions to a T and it's not working (so I assume I'm misunderstanding something, but I have no idea what). Went for office hours and the TA just never showed up. I could go in for a different TA's office hours tomorrow (it's due tonight so I'd be taking late marks but I'd still get most of the grades), but with all the other stuff I have on my plate I honestly think it might not be worth it."
Greg,That sucks dude
Greg,this course is such a nightmare
Greg,What class is this?
Greg,neural nets
Greg,the content is really interesting
Greg,but the prof sucks
Greg,and 2/3 TAs suck
Greg,"and the lecture slides suck, and the assignments are missing like half the information you'd need to do the assignment, and there's zero feedback on anything"
Greg,every time this year you've seen me complain about a course it's been this one
Greg,Is there a department head that you could talk to about this?
Greg,This honestly sounds really annoying
Greg,"probably, but they're notoriously backed up one everything"
Greg,@Ultimate yall wanna do some fun ultimate thing later
Greg,like a character crew battle?
Greg,I'd be down if I can get all my stuff done
Greg,that's why im working rn

Greg,So
Greg,Some of these seem like they would take years to finish
Greg,Do you understand implicit differentiation?
Greg,"I don't remember what implicit differentiation is, but I know how I'd solve this normally"
Greg,Mostly
Greg,so I dunno how much help I'll be
Greg,I can help
Greg,I know what the rules are but sometimes Isolating y' is very hard

Greg,or is it just my incineroar and lucario
Greg,just cause you're annoying doesnt mean the chars are idiot

Greg,Uhhhhh
Greg,Please tell me whippets are something else in canada
Greg,Isn't that a drug?
Greg,lol no
Greg,It's nitrous oxide in canisters and you huff it
Greg,But I assume it's something else
Greg,Unless Canada has some lit grocery stores
Greg,
Greg,Ah
Greg,I see
Greg,they are very addicting though
Greg,but usually more expensive than I would pay for
Greg,but it was 2 boxes for $5 as opposed to one box for $3.50
Greg,oh i thought whippets were dogs
Greg,they are that as well
Greg,two boxes of dogs for $5 would be pretty amazing
Greg,although that'd be a lot of dogs to take care of
Greg,but I could probably sell them at a reasonable markup
Greg,i wonder how many dogs comes in one box
Greg,@Ultimate anyone downs?
Greg,thats a little personal of a question dont ya think

Greg,I should get one
Greg,I just need a way to set up a push to talk that I can use while playing a game with a controller. My current thought is some kind of foot pedal.
Greg,Just use a button on the controller

Greg,you fought the spirit of my frustration at this neural nets assignment
Greg,yoshi link might be 100 0
Greg,that matchup feels very impossible
Greg,@Trapezoider @The Rona Rocket launched

Greg,aight ya boi went on a run today https://kingstonsmash.challonge.com/KU39
Greg,Kingston Smash Ultimate 2019 - Weekly #39 - Challonge
Greg,"(also got 7th in melee, was one stock away from beating #3 in the city too but then I choked, and continued my unbroken string of 2nd places in unist, although I took a game off the best player in the city this time)"
Greg,Nice losers run
Greg,thanks :)
Greg,I played such a weird mix of characters
Greg,but like 2/3 incineroar and it worked really well
Greg,I made one guy soooo mad and ended up getting my first PR win for the season
Greg,"he won game 1, I took game 2, then he swapped off his main (dedede) for roy which was hilarious cause of all those incineroar-roy games I played against max where I learned to cheese the poor boy (runoff lariat), then he pulled a PT and I showed him why you don't try to zone out incineroar"
Greg,I feel bad for him. Incineroar would be in gouge eyes out tier of my annoying tier list.
Greg,yeah a little bit
Greg,I played some Bowser today
Greg,oh no
Greg,man is easy
Greg,are we gonna have three
Greg,no
Greg,yeah he's pretty straight forward
Greg,I just wanted to prove a point
Greg,have I ever pretended like he's not easy?
Greg,That wasn't the point. I was proving that he is good.
Greg,I always thought he was pretty good too?
Greg,he's at worst upper mid tier
Greg,These points were not directed at you
Greg,fair
Greg,I learned some new ledge trapping tricks with Palu as well in my session today against Benson.
Greg,I also finally hit this one unist combo in a real match for once
Greg,the one and only time I get to feel like mika actually has good damage
Greg,"costs half my meter as a starter though, and the other half as the ender, but it does like 50% of most characters health"
Greg,"was also the first time I didn't feel totally outmatched against harley (he did still 3-1 3-0 me between winner's and grand finals, but most of the games were really close)"
Greg,Have you lost to him for every 2nd place finish?
Greg,"naw, the weeks he wasn't there I lost to different people -_-"
Greg,but he is responsible for most of them
Greg,ay I just found that discord has a setting that puts light theme pretty much back to how it used to be
Greg,it's not quite as good but now I have a better alternative to dark mode so I'm going for it
Greg,dark sidebar pog
Greg,yup
Greg,although the old light theme had a lighter grey for the sidebar
Greg,it also had a darker bit for the users sidebar
Greg,but it's still better than all dark
Greg,but new light theme kinda nice tho

Greg,uhhhh
Greg,there's one restriction
Greg,the topic has to have a call to action that students can act upon immediately
Greg,Easy one that people will like is a call for more environmentally friendly behavior.
Greg,"You can talk about the importance of participating in a democracy. Cite low voter turnout percentages, and encourage voting in the next election."
Greg,yeah but im pretty sure that the person right before me is doing that already
Greg,the environment one
Greg,oh snap voting could be good
Greg,except that i dont do it
Greg,Do they know that though
Greg,im losing my mind
Greg,the topic should be a formation of a think tank for people who can't think of things to write about for schoolwork

Greg,i think literally every student hates it
Greg,I had one professor that gave his own custom paper homework and it was the best ever
Greg,The start of class was dedicated to helping people who didn't understand it
Greg,I miss back when math classes weren't 3 hours long
Greg,i hate any class thats 3 hours long
Greg,regardless of subject
Greg,tbh math is probably the subject I can most stand for that long a time period
Greg,It is really easy to burn time with long problems
Greg,guys im really tired despite getting entirely adequate amounts of sleep what do
Greg,maybe im sick
Greg,That's just life dude
Greg,"Could be a symptom of depression, but I'm not sure on that"

Greg,F
Greg,Feel better buddy
Greg,I haven't grown up in a couple hours so I think I'm fine

Greg,i am watching stuff
Greg,"weekly summary:
7th in melee, lost to 1st and 2nd place, had pretty close sets against both of em (last stock game 3 with 2nd, two last hit games with 1st)

5th in ultimate, lost to 1st and 4th. Got bodied by the guy who won, game 5 last hit with the 4th place guy (who I kinda sorta hate as a human being and he said he'd quit if he ever lost to incineroar, so I'm real sad about that)

2nd in unist as always, but probably featured the ""highlight"" of the weekly, where between the last game of winner's finals and first two games of grands, I landed one hit. In those three games (six rounds) I was perfected 5 times. I have never been so completely destroyed in any game ever. Not playing melee against Ryan Ford or Moky, or ringing for plat 6s when I was in steel. Holy fuck I got completely and utterly shredded."
Greg,I also ate an excellent burrito that was far beyond my capacity for spiciness but it was so damn good that I kept taking these huge bites and then dying for the next five minutes then being really excited to take another bite
Greg,My younger self resonates with this so much

Greg,                                                                                                                              
Greg,
Greg,Man imagine playing  cowboi game when you arent even american
Greg,smfh
Greg,Game fun as fuck though
Greg,imagine buying rdr2 twice
Greg,literally spending 120 dollars on a video game
Greg,Literally didn't buy it the first time
Greg,My dad bought it for himself
Greg,I just mooched
Greg,Kameron out here thinking we pay 120 dollars for 2 video games
Greg,
Greg,TRUE
Greg,not in canadian schmeckles my friend
Greg,my b i meant 400 chuck e cheese coupons
Greg,^
Greg,there you go
Greg,@Trapezoider where'd you find my dpotg vods?
Greg,@Cs:go any1?
Greg,Youtub
Greg,Can yousend me the link I couldn't find it
Greg,@Cs:go
Greg,need a fifth
Greg,Someone just sent me a pic on Snapchat of them holding a pumpkin spiced latte and saying “still holding onto those fall vibes”
Greg,Like ofc you are it’s still fall you dumb bitch
Greg,"I think theyre saying that the ""fall vibes"" have become tangible through the latte that theyve had for a while"
Greg,kinda deep if you think about it
Greg,Ok push guy
Greg,Ok now I go this way
Greg,People in r/smashbros don't understand how balance work
Greg,Actually neither do blizzard tbh
Greg,Whenever you talk about the general public
Greg,They generally have no idea how to balance a game
Greg,you aren't supposed to buff bad character's weakness or nerf good character's strengths
Greg,you buff bad character's inherent strengths and nerf good characters inherent weaknesses
Greg,that keeps characters different and interesting
Greg,like people on r/smashbros are saying to buff incineroar's speed
Greg,but that would not make any sense with how incineroar works as a character
Greg,he's slow because his moves are really good and cover a lot of space
Greg,same as people who wanted to nerf roadhog's hook but make him more tanky
Greg,the tradeoff for roadhog was that he can have a high burst damage output but you risk dieing and feeding ult charge
Greg,oh god fast incineroar would be horrifying
Greg,but hurr durr he a tank he shouldnt do damage but he should have damage resistances like every other tank that already exists but have more utility than hog when you remove his hook's usefullness
Greg,also yea fast incineroar would be stupid
Greg,just let PT play as any three pokemon
Greg,he'd just be better bowser
Greg,why would you want that r/smashbros
Greg,not pt incin
Greg,becasue r/smashbros is not a particularly smart environment
Greg,but like these are core concepts of game balance
Greg,also that was a suggestion for a different dumb change
Greg,it would be funny
Greg,like preschooler level stuff
Greg,but also wack as fuck
Greg,yeah
Greg,you only nerf a strong character's strengths if you didn't actually mean to make it a strength/overdid it
Greg,you dont remove characters weaknesses when they bad or every char is gonna feel the same
Greg,^
Greg,true
Greg,like it's good that sm4sh took out diddy down throw up air up air up air
Greg,and made bayo stuff less consistent (for all the good that did)
Greg,like the only change I would make to pika is make him bigger or make his moves do less damage
Greg,but in general if you take away both strengths and weaknesses you end up with a bland cast
Greg,because fast safe moves and an insane recover are supposed to be pika's strengths
Greg,imo I'd make him upb on stage more punishable
Greg,but being small and doing a lot of damage are not
Greg,it's kind of a dumb neutral tool
Greg,yea mayb
Greg,but that would fall into your thing of a strength being too strong
Greg,like joker for example is a fundementally broken char
Greg,"but yeah his whole point is that he's small, fast, and has high-execution stuff that's really good"
Greg,because his strengths and weaknesses do not adhere to the design of the game
Greg,yeah he's a weird one
Greg,I can't really think of a good way to fix him without totally redesigning him as a character
Greg,so he should be changed entirely imo
Greg,also some parts of his kit are just crazy overtuned
Greg,like down gun
Greg,I mean really you just gotta change how arsene and down gun work
Greg,and side b doing like 17
Greg,and his arsene moves having hitboxes the size of bowser
Greg,but yea arsene coming from taking damage makes no sense
Greg,and hitting him with arsene should make it go away very quickly
Greg,"I'd say just make it so that if he eats a certain number of attacks he just loses arsense automatically, so if you hit him with like four moves (not four hits, four moves) he's back to normal"
Greg,or just like
Greg,yea
Greg,make him more in line with the game he's from
Greg,and just have arsene for his specials
Greg,and his normals are his normals
Greg,or maybe 25 damage and arsene goes away
Greg,he'd still be really good but not as dumb
Greg,but he gets arsene by dealing 30 damage
Greg,or make it time based idk
Greg,or go the p4a route of if you hit him with arsene out enough times he just has no arsene for the whole stock
Greg,meh characters changing based on stock stuff like that is kinda dumb imo
Greg,eh maybe
Greg,like lucario
Greg,or krool
Greg,krool?
Greg,his belly can break
Greg,oh right
Greg,or wonderwing
Greg,but banjo is just lame tho
Greg,also I gotta say I hate that arsene is such a bad mechanic because the visual design for arsene is so damn cool
Greg,but in smash it's such an anti-fun mechanic
Greg,and also you can barely see him
Greg,it really be tho
Greg,zack why dont you play joker
Greg,cause he's not all that fun imo
Greg,I don't like having to rely on arsene or tricky setups for my kills
Greg,I really wanted to like him
Greg,Only big losers play joker
Greg,Wrong
Greg,Only big winners play joker
Greg,Also
Greg,Only cuties
Greg,
Greg,whens kameron 5
Greg,soon
Greg,brother
Greg,"Zack: 15
Kameron: 8"
Greg,@SWIRL GIRL @Bitmin @Mr. Airplane csgo
Greg,yes
Greg,10 minutes
Greg,then me and matt play
Greg,@Cs:go need 1 more
Greg,i can come in 10
Greg,Paradise Lost might be up there as one of the works books I've ever been forced to read
Greg,By Milton?
Greg,No the other paradise lost
Greg,They buffed incineroar's neutral b a bunch 
Greg,Spin move time
Greg,Spin move!
Greg,patch notes?
Greg,also WHY did they buff incineroar neutral b
Greg,move's already mad good
Greg,Also Terry is out already
Greg,We play later tonight lads @Ultimate
Greg,Time to pick up another character
Greg,lol they buffed incineroar neutral b... third hit
Greg,just specifically the third hit
Greg,of like five
Greg,They buffed the rest of the move too keep reading
Greg,(oh wait that was jabs I'm dumb)
Greg,that is a big yikes
Greg,and revenge lasts longer and has less end lag
Greg,fair got a bit nerfed though? hard to tell
Greg,either they added a weak hitbox or they really extended the weak hitbox I can't tell
Greg,Terry appearantly is kinda nice
Greg,No Palu nerfs
Greg,I'm satisfied
Greg,I'm definitely a little upset they buffed Incineroar though
Greg,I mean he doesn't have any new goofy stuff
Greg,just some of his old goofy stuff is better
Greg,I still don't think it's enough for me to solo main him
Greg,"(also, probably won't immediately be joining ultimate stuff tonight, some of my housemates who play traditional fighters want to learn, and also I'm gonna be learning some soul caliber, so I probably won't be around until pretty late)"
Greg,I have a test tomorrow so I will be trying Terry offline for like 5 minutes but won't be here to play online games.
Greg,
Greg,just study now and we can play later
Greg,I have to go to class now
Greg,I just woke up
Greg,
Greg,oh dear terry has double quarter circle inputs
Greg,and also what appears to be ghetto qc back half circle forwards
Greg,this is what we get for KoF characters
Greg,Kinda hype for Terry not gonna lie
Greg,@Ultimate fite me
Greg,I'll play for 30 minutes

Greg,ill play but gonna bathroom first
Greg,"""Let's say you want to play poker. Let's say, hypothetically, you want to get a group of friends and play poker. Ok, and if you did play with friends, you would want to play with the homies right? Then hypothetically speaking, there would be a frostbite poker night. Now, let's say its tonight.

Now that we have established that there will be a poker night and the homies are invited, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that it would be fun. Am I not correct? A group of the homies deserves poker night, so I suggest that we play poker."""

Greg,I had such a lucky bracket lol
Greg,able dq'd?
Greg,"able DQ'd, and while I've brought him to last hit both times I've fought him he's always won, then Lungs upset Boo who I probably would have lost to again"
Greg,and then dog was playing luigi instead of his usual sheik
Greg,and his usual sheik fucks me up
Greg,made $10.50 from a $2 entry fee
Greg,did not cover the cost of entering two brackets and buying a giant burrito

Greg,
Greg,
Greg,"Got 33rd (3-2) at an ultimate regional, which I'm okay with given that both players I lost to finished 7th. I couldn't plausibly have done better given my seeding and I feel like I played pretty well. Also I made another campy player really mad about Incineroar which is always nice. Didn't even need revenge, just knowing that a) dash attack picks up banana and you're diddy so I don't care about the tiny punish you might get from that, b) while holding banana I still have access to sideb, lariat, and upb, and c) banana -> sideb is a thing Incineroar can do."

Greg,Good one
Greg,"“I don’t think I’ll have kids”
- Boring
- Invites argument

“My bloodline dies with me”
- Assertive
- Metal as fuck
- Implies you’re taking on a great noble burden which allows no arguments"
Greg,ty devon very cool
Greg,Me and Joan were discussing antinatalism and my 7 month pregnant boss walked in
Greg,I’ll keep y’all posted if I still have a job next week
Greg,Antinatalism is super toxic
Greg,It's up there with the death acceptance movement as one of my least favorite philosophical positions.
Greg,"Holdup why is the death acceptance movement one of your least favourite positions, I’m genuinely trying to find anything somebody could object to about it"
Greg,I have no idea why anyone would want to die given the alternative.
Greg,Suffering?
Greg,Eternal life is the ultimate goal of all medical research. Death and aging cause so much suffering that to end it would be a triumph unparalleled for all time.
Greg,Death acceptance is not a debate on medical suicide if that's what you were thinking
Greg,It means opposing eternal life
Greg,If that’s your stance then I don’t see how you can be antinatalism if you think living forever is the end goal then obv once we can live forever we need to stop having kids
Greg,No
Greg,We need to expand to other planets
Greg,So I understand the death acceptance movement and given the opportunity to have eternal life I would decline
Greg,There’s no point in living without dying imo
Greg,That is so contrary to my own belief I cannot comprehend why anyone would ever think that.
Greg,Eternal life is cool but if eternal life means an eternity of floating in the middle of space aimlessly while i lose my mind id rather not
Greg,"Would you ask the grim reaper to bring you blindness, weakness, ugliness, and an end to your relatives and yourself if he were a real entity. Why not just ask for nothing and lead a more enjoyable existence."
Greg,Eternal life doesn't mean you literally exist until the end of the universe
Greg,@Rotomotorz
Greg,"Watch CGP Grey's video ""why die"" for a great overview of my position"
Greg,?
Greg,Floating in the middle of space aimlessly
Greg,i.e.
Greg,just you floating in space
Greg,no ground for you to stand on
Greg,no like in a shuttle
Greg,not literally just you
Greg,The concept of one day you will die gives life more purpose and meaning IMO
Greg,"Also  @Max , does your idea of eternal life also include eternal youth?"
Greg,Yes of course. The research of the two go hand in hand.
Greg,"Okay, that's what I thought"
Greg,One will be a natural result of the other
Greg,But I wanted to make sure
Greg,"Also @Eric Working From Home , you will still eventually die"
Greg,In your uptown world is capitalism abolished or are human wage slaves for eternity
Greg,It's just about delaying that for as long as possible
Greg,Would you beat your child to make the days you don't beat him more enjoyable?
Greg,Utopian**
Greg,@Max that is so far from the point it’s mind boggling
Greg,Death giving life meaning is analogous to what I said
Greg,wait yeah thats definitely not analogous
Greg,I mean it bigly ain’t
Greg,If you think so then you don't understand my position
Greg,The concept of dying means your days are numbered and gives motivation to enjoy you days as you can
Greg,If you could live forever you’d have no motivation to accomplish anything
Greg,Maybe if you are lazy
Greg,I think it would lead to even greater progress since humans would never have to reset their knowledge pool
Greg,what gives people motivation during endless life
Greg,tho
Greg,Life is meaning in itself
Greg,I guess if you don't share that position none of my others make any sense
Greg,I have to go to class now
Greg,Perhaps but what do you plan to do with the people who view otherwise
Greg,Let them die obviously
Greg,so then endless life is a choice?
Greg,Why wouldn't it be
Greg,or is it given to only select individuals
Greg,And if its a choice what do you do with those of no ambition that choose to live forever
Greg,Not many people instictively wabt to die
Greg,People should have the option of death should they choose
Greg,I can consent to dying I couldn’t consent to being born
Greg,Like what if everybody all stopped having kids and humanity just lived in this utopian society until we all eventually died out and then the earth can try again in 1000000 years once primates evolve to our level
Greg,That’s the dream right there baby
Greg,Why would we not want ourselves to evolve?
Greg,Why would we want to end as homo sapiens?
Greg,When we could become homo superior?
Greg,What you propose is literally the opposite of what life tries to do
Greg,Life doesn’t take ethics and morality into account
Greg,Life doesn’t care if it’s ethically and morally wrong to have a child
Greg,I don't think it needs to
Greg,It just wants you to procreate and die
Greg,It supercedes all things
Greg,ethics and morality are mere concepts that we as humans have come up with
Greg,Life is a concept not an entity
Greg,Aren’t ethics and morality what we view and making us different and superior to non sentient races
Greg,Living != surviving
Greg,Life doesn't need to be an entity to supercede other concepts
Greg,If you are of the opinion that we should be slaves to the machinations of life then why oppose death
Greg,One merely exists because of the other
Greg,I also don't understand how procreation would be ethically or morally wrong
Greg,"A child can’t consent to being born, a child is burdened by the implications of society without being given a choose and inversely society is burdened by another person to cause damage to others and the world"
Greg,If you want a kid then adopt one
Greg,"There’s only three reasons to birth a child: ignorance, narcissism or both."
Greg,"That is a pretty narrow statement though, don't you think?"
Greg,What about that is narrow
Greg,Just because something cannot consent to being born doesn't mean that it is unhappy because it was
Greg,Also
Greg,It only takes into account the morality and ethics side of life
Greg,"We don’t owe life, it will persist regardless of our actions so why should we slave to it"
Greg,Why shouldn't I owe life? It allows me to exist and be who I am today. Passing on my own genes doesn't mean that I am a slave to life
Greg,So you want to have children to pass on your genes
Greg,It also gives others the chance to experience what life has to offer
Greg,I realize that this could be interpreted as your both statement
Greg,but so what?
Greg,Why don’t we just agree to disagree then cause it seems we are at an impasse
Greg,
Greg,This is 100% topic
Greg,But
Greg,I just got my schedule for next term
Greg,"and again, I only got 3 of the classes that I enrolled for"
Greg,Bruh hunt down the guy making the schedules
Greg,That’s bogus
Greg,So I went to look at all the class schedules
Greg,To see what was causing the conflict
Greg,and
Greg,There isn't any
Greg,There is literally no conflict
Greg,I didn't get put into these classes for reasons unknown
Greg,These classes are still open by the way
Greg,And they are also only available during winter

Greg,"also, at the tourney today we ran doubles, I ended up teaming in melee with a guy who's not all that good (generally goes 1-2 or 2-2, has no PR wins for the season) on the semi-arbitrary recommendation of dayman and we ended up going pretty hard - beat a team of #3 in the city and a guy around my level, and we were the only team to take a game off the team that won

we placed third, which doesn't seem all that impressive given that there were only 5 teams, but we crushed a team with players around the same levels, and beat a team we had absolutely no right to even get a game from"
Greg,@Homies quick bitta games or naw
Greg,we had shockingly good synergy
Greg,and I feel like if we practice we'll be an actual serious dubs threat
Greg,Aw fuck mate I’d love for a spot of games ping me if ya end up playing a not smash or csgo game

Greg,snow 
Greg,i hate snow

Greg,new
Greg,also the whole chunk that part is from is basically throwing shade at jews
Greg,"which is really funny because it frequently calls them hypocrites but I sure haven't heard of anyone, no matter how devout, tear out an eye because they saw someone attractive"
Greg,Yo but if every dude alive nutted at the same time
Greg,what would happen?
Greg,
Greg,A lot of teachers would be fired
Greg,no but like
Greg,if all dudes were on a rocket ship
Greg,and were facing dick down
Greg,could the nutt blast get you to orbit?
Greg,OR better yet
Greg,If they were facing dick up
Greg,Could they de orbit earth? 
Greg,unlikely
Greg,since each man's nut would have to propel their own body weight
Greg,and adding more people would just make that less efficient

Greg,The guys that you see at the end of it are the main characters
Greg,gotcha
Greg,Yee
Greg,I'm probably gonna play through before the storm then do life is strange again and then do the 2nd
Greg,Man now I'm excited for the last episode but I have an essay to write
Greg,wanna trade essays
Greg,and then neither of us do them and instead we play life is strange together?

Greg,my statuses were just my name and numbers
Greg,"A closed room is a concept used in mystery fiction. An example would be a room with a corpse and the only key to that room in the pocket of the dead person, giving the impression that the crime was not possible to commit."
Greg,I've been reading mystery fiction for the last few months and closed rooms have come up a lot.
Greg,I'm gonna bother you to play danganronpa again

Greg,Does Danganronpa have closed rooms?

Greg,you can't dodge closed rooms
Greg,stfu i was planning on playing them soon
Greg,ruining everything
Greg,look my dude
Greg,STFU
Greg,saying there's a lot of murder in danganronpa is like saying there's a lot of cowboys in red dead redemption
Greg,it's literally the premise
Greg,LOL
Greg,you're reminding me i need to play it too
Greg,wonder if i can pirate it somehow 
Greg,I can literally send you the rom
Greg,right now
Greg,woa h
Greg,i feel bad pirating games tho
Greg,i should just buy it
Greg,aight here's what I'd say
Greg,if you're not sure if you're gonna like it
Greg,"pirate it, play the first two trials then make up your mind"
Greg,"and then you can decide to stop, or buy it, or do what I did and finish the first game but buy the other two"

Greg,memes - 5 characters
Greg,memes > quotes

Greg,also those aren't even the true definitions but go off ig
Greg,they arn't deffinitions

Greg,where did you even get that from???
Greg,i've never heard it described like that in my life
Greg,"weebs tend to be more of an ""american style"" shitpost version of otaku"
Greg,meanwhile otakus originate from the mainland itself
Greg,and dont really have that satire
Greg,?????
Greg,bruh
Greg,i ain't heard the word otaku in YEARS
Greg,idk where you're getting your info from
Greg,Gigguk
Greg,he said that?
Greg,weeb and otaku are interchangeable words
Greg,but there is a diffrence in which one is called
Greg,and percived
Greg,"that's why i said ""but there is a diffrence between a real otaku and a fake one"""

Greg,
Greg,^
Greg,saying youre an otaku is tbh more cringe than saying you're a weeb
Greg,cause atleast you arent in denail if you admit to being a weeb
Greg,there's a real dictionary deffiniton of otaku and not weeb
Greg,Well i just tried to kill myself
Greg,i'm genuinely unsure if you guys know the difference.
Greg,if you use a non english term to describe how much of an anime fan you are then you're a weeb
Greg,"weeb, ottaku who cards they both cringe"
Greg,you're all gay
Greg,problem solved
Greg,
Greg,^
Greg,so basically according to that video: Otakus don't exist in the west
Greg,checkmate
Greg,the weeb vs weeaboo thing seems to be true
Greg,"basically otaku is just a cringe-y, outdated term that people in the west don't really say anymore"
Greg,literally no one cares
Greg,im just saying rainbowpixel is wrONG
Greg,and im the more cultured weeb here
Greg,
Greg,Seems to fit
Greg,no ?
Greg,I mean what you just said now
Greg,compare your message with his definition
Greg,i never defined weeb
Greg,"all it means is someone who likes anime, that's literally it"
Greg,"""I'm the more cultured weeb here"" is what I was referring to"
Greg,don't you guys live in the same house?
Greg,IT WAS A JOKE SDKLFJSLDKJF

Greg,"I will hopefully be able to do that as well. Its doubtful that I'll have the time though, since I will be taking calc 2 when it comes out. My math professors have said to not expect much free time when taking calc 2."
Greg,I've looked over some of the stuff for integration
Greg,It seems conceptually easier than differential
Greg,That is so wrong
Greg,"But the ""shutup and calculate"" bits seem hard"
Greg,
Greg,Taking derivatives is pretty easy once you understand all the rules
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,Is my second comment correct?
Greg,I mean
Greg,It's just plug and chug really
Greg,But the equations can get complicated
Greg,so you have to be careful
Greg,What do you mean by shutup and calculate?
Greg,Definite integrals
Greg,You mean using the fundamental theorem?
Greg,I don't think so
Greg,Definite integrals are the ones where you have limits of integration right?
Greg,Definite integrals have a defined boundary
Greg,yes
Greg,Shutup and calculate is just another way of saying plug and chug
Greg,When you have found the antiderivative of a given function
Greg,and you want to calculate with the given boundary
Greg,To solve those what I've been doing is integrating and then plugging the 2 limits into the new equation and subtracting one from the other.
Greg,"It comes from physics land where students get to philosophical about what equations mean so the teachers shout ""SHUTUP AND CALCULATE!"""
Greg,@Max is your school trimesters or semesters?
Greg,semesters
Greg,Ahh
Greg,That's why you covered integration in calc 1
Greg,We have 3 calc courses 
Greg,So should Max
Greg,I mean my school does have calc 3
Greg,but I don't need to take it
Greg,Calc 3 is multivariable calculus
Greg,Chemistry majors only need up to calc 2
Greg,TBH now I'm confused and am not sure which calculi are available at my uni 
Greg,you should have calc 1-3

Greg,candy tier list
Greg,"Airheads God Tier, KitKat God tier, Reese dropped to very solid, Candy Cigarette dropped to suck"
Greg,How the fuck are airheads god tier
Greg,Airheads actually a tier above god tier
Greg,Not just saying this to fuck with you guys
Greg,This tier list is garbage
Greg,Airheads are #1 candy
Greg,Puts hot tamales in the pixie sticks tier this doesn’t even make any sense
Greg,They suck just as much as pixie sticks
Greg,I can understand why you disagree that it’s god tier but I’m genuinely baffled why airheads is rated as a low tier candy
Greg,LAFFY TAFFY IS GOOD
Greg,Unless you’re ranking it low cause like “oh it’s sticky if you hold it”
Greg,WAY BETTER THAN AIRHEADS
Greg,SMH
Greg,Airheads taste good
Greg,they aight
Greg,this is the worst tiers list of all time
Greg,Clearly the people who made this tier list had no hard candy proponents on their board of directors
Greg,How biased
Greg,How discriminatory
Greg,how are dots and health very solid ???
Greg,calling HR
Greg,those are both pretty nasty
Greg,There wasn't much hard candy here anyways
Greg,Also laffy taffy and airheads suck
Greg,settle this like civilized men and women
Greg,fight to the death
Greg,You have to put way too much effort into eating them for very little payoff
Greg,LAFFY TAFFY TASTES SUPER GOOD WYM
Greg,and theyre not hard to eat at all
Greg,im boutta throw hands
Greg,Throw them
Greg,also fun dip is great dont @ me
Greg,bro square up
Greg,I'm squared up
Greg,
Greg,yea maybe fun dip and laffy taffy are good if you like to suffer
Greg,Laffy Taffy better than airheads no cap
Greg,they both trash
Greg,No
Greg,they just sugar
Greg,if i wanna eat sugar
Greg,i would just eat sugar
Greg,They solid at lowest
Greg,yea
Greg,solidly in the lowest tier
Greg,Reese's overrated
Greg,that's patently false
Greg,No
Greg,@Mr. Airplane
Greg,Holy shit this is so bad
Greg,How the fuck are pixie sticks in c
Greg,Fun dip in b
Greg,Holy shit
Greg,sorry that you're wrong
Greg,EDIT: updated tier names adn dropped jawbreakers down a tier cause idk why i had them as high as they were
Greg,Verified Baby 
Greg,For what
Greg,https://www.speedrun.com/tabletop_simulator/full_game
Greg,speedrun.com
Greg,"Speedrunning leaderboards, resources, forums, and more!"
Greg,This is the greatest disservice I have ever seen for left handed people
Greg,We only get the left armrest
Greg,Everyone else has two except for the poor right handed person beside me
Greg,wouldn't that make it good for left handed people?
Greg,yea wait hold up
Greg,“””technically””” in the best (worst?) case where all seats are filled everyone else also only gets one armrest since you ain’t putting ur arm on someone else’s
Greg,otherwise you get below average armrests
Greg,oh snap it's elvin
Greg,just sit in one of hte center seats if you want two armrests so bad
Greg,the god
Greg,alvin
Greg,my favourite chipmunk
Greg,dab
Greg,also @Eric Working From Home ur candy tier list is high key awful
Greg,"your argument that ""its just sugar so why wouldnt i jsut eat sugar"" is the dumbest thing ive ever heard"
Greg,okay that was a joke
Greg,but actually
Greg,pixie sticks
Greg,are just sugar in a paper tube
Greg,crutches at school is not the move
Greg,there is no appeal to that whatsoever
Greg,also what jed said that too
Greg,thats why they C tier
Greg,"pixie sticks have no flavor, they are messy, and they make you want to die after eating them"
Greg,you put reese way too high
Greg,ok they arent messy
Greg,if you make a mess with them you're big dubm
Greg,reeses are clearly the best candy
Greg,what if you wanted to die before eating them
Greg,You literally can't eat them
Greg,If they get any moisture in them whatsoever
Greg,im convinced you two are disabled
Greg,It's game over
Greg,^
Greg,dont spit into the tube then??????
Greg,???
Greg,You have to put the tube to your mouth to eat it
Greg,you guys are also way too hung up on the pixie sticks i put them into C tier you monkeys
Greg,It's inevitable
Greg,oml how do you function
Greg,you turn the tube over nd pour it onto ur tongue
Greg,"Plus, even if you do get anything out of them"
Greg,like you dont suck the shit outta a tube
Greg,They don't even taste good
Greg,the only candy that i would consider being worse than pixie sticks is hot tamales
Greg,i put them C tier i dont know why you're so hung up on them
Greg,its not like i put them in A tier
Greg,In
Greg,What
Greg,World
Greg,Are they better than
Greg,Resses pieces
Greg,??????????????????
Greg,"hot tomales are like someone took mike and ikes and went ""yea these are incredibly disappointing, but i think we could make them worse"""
Greg,cause reeses pieces are big 
Greg,its like skittles meets the bad part of reeses
Greg,Ok
Greg,I just saw that you put York peppermint patties below them
Greg,Your opinion on candy is so bad
Greg,the fact that the bottom tier contained spicy candy is the only thing that saved yorks from bottom tier
Greg,yorks are actually
Greg,so
Greg,fucking
Greg,bad
Greg,you know what
Greg,i'd put them on the same level of hot tamales
Greg,york peppermint patties are the most vile disgusting shit in hte world
Greg,like peppermint marshmallow
Greg,what the fuck
Greg,youn know what fuck hot tamales im putting york patties in hte bottom tier
Greg,Looking more into your tier list
Greg,"bruh i dunno how i can trust anyone's opinion who puts CRUNCH above REECES, TWIX, HEATH, and SNICKERS"
Greg,You have fundip above twix
Greg,And twizzlers
Greg,that might be the worst take in this whole list
Greg,"hot take, twix bigly not good"
Greg,twix kinda meh
Greg,crunch is the worst chocolate bar free
Greg,Also
Greg,Skittles below fundip
Greg,no
Greg,What planet are you on?
Greg,twix is a crunchy flavourless cookie pretending to be a chocolate bar by adding in infinitesimal amounts fo chocolate and caramel
Greg,crunch is good
Greg,idk whats wrong with you
Greg,crunch is the kinda chocolate bar that you eat when you have given up on enjoying chocolate bars
Greg,chris the kinda guy with such shit taste in candy he puts this stuff in S tier
Greg,crunch is literally just a milk chocolate bar with crunchy pieces
Greg,idk what you find wrong with it
Greg,yes
Greg,you guys also thuroughly did not give milk duds enough credit
Greg,like unless you're lowering its rank cause its like cement for your teeth
Greg,cause if you your list loses all credit then
Greg,that is exactly why we put it lower
Greg,you guys are goons
Greg,also it snowing outside widepeepohappy
Greg,we're not ranking how fucking ergonomic the candy is
Greg,that is part of the consumption pprocess
Greg,we ranking how good it tastes
Greg,you moron
Greg,you fool
Greg,yall are some fucking reeses shills might I add
Greg,when trick or treating I wouldn't even trade my reeses pieces for anything I'd literally give that shit away
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,i should've known Chris' Cnady tier list would be shit cause of that time when he asked what candy i wanted i said gummies and this MF got Sour Cola Bottle Gummies
Greg,not even normal ones
Greg,fucking
Greg,sour
Greg,cola
Greg,bottle
Greg,gummies

Greg,@Matt  i got 11 lights
Greg,9 regular and lux
Greg,Just got back from a reddit event at the board game café. It was pretty fun. 
Greg,what does that mean
Greg,It means people in the Houston board games subreddit said that there would be a lot of people there that day and they invited others to come join them. The store even gave a discount if you mentioned the subreddit.
Greg,nice
Greg,
Greg,I will be distancing myself from the other Zacks after discovering what shit taste they have
Greg,Literally
Greg,cereal
Greg,
Greg,This cereal tier list is pretty good
Greg,yeah
Greg,Much better than the candy one
Greg,we made it with group think
Greg,that's why kamerons bad opinions didn't make it to light
Greg,
Greg,fuuuuck the internet historian just released an hour long video
Greg,but I need to write an essy
Greg,oops
Greg,N O M A N S S K Y
Greg,whatabouttit
Greg,Internet historians video is about that
Greg,"Corn flakes isnt an ""organic"" ceral tf?"
Greg,
Greg,well it is tasteless
Greg,"Also the ""organic"" tier was a meme"
Greg,ah like my meatloaf ingredient tier
Greg,but also i heard feeding people grape nuts is banned by hte geneva convention
Greg,"and @Rotomotorz corn flakes are tasteless to stop masturbation, its by design"
Greg,
Greg,god yall so uneducated
Greg,"It might just be that your distaste for corn flakes is not by accident though, as Mr Kellogg actually developed cornflakes primarily to stop children from masturbating!  He had particular ideas about masturbation, writing, “if illicit commerce of the sexes is a heinous sin, self-pollution is a crime doubly abominable.” He felt that certain foods inspired ‘self-pollution’, like spicy foods,  meat, and generally anything that tasted too good. One of the biggest fights he had with his brother, and business partner, was over adding sugar to cornflakes. Kellogg’s brother had the (right) idea that sugar would vastly improve the taste of the cereal, but Kellogg stood by his original vision, that of plain and boring, sexual desire killing food, so the flakes remained unsweetened."
Greg,also hot take
Greg,french topast crunch
Greg,not that good
Greg,That's the hottest take
Greg,Because it is so wrong
Greg,undeniably worse that cinnamon toast crunch at the very least
Greg,atleast the latter has flavour
Greg,wait this corn flake story is hilarious
Greg,kellogg is actually stupid
Greg,well he became very rich and thne very dead
Greg,@Eric Working From Home your list is bad
Greg,My list may be bad but I stand by French toast crunch being at most B tier material
Greg,gamers
Greg,non-gamers
Greg,D:
Greg,daheck the iceborn monster hunter dlc is $40
Greg,It's a whole new storyline with a bunch of new monsters and more
Greg,New area aswell
Greg,so like
Greg,1/5th of a game
Greg,theres like 12 new monsters
Greg,31 total
Greg,so like 2/5th of a game
Greg,get it right
Greg,
Greg,Joined the server.
Greg,yo i told you guys french toast cruch was top teir
Greg,it really aint tho
Greg,"cheap, tasty, affordable for a broke student living by the paycheck ."
Greg,
Greg,the community consistently ranks it B-C tier
Greg,lucky charms is too sweet.
Greg,it is cheap and affordable
Greg,honey nuts is s
Greg,but it is flavourless
Greg,It's literally not flavourless though
Greg,Like what
Greg,naw. you can taste the honey
Greg,that's what makes it good
Greg,Do you have a tounge?
Greg,must've had a bad box at your place then during meetup
Greg,also life is really good too
Greg,cause it was like flavourless cardboard cubes
Greg,frosted flakes is also way too sweet
Greg,nah forsted flakes S tier
Greg,yeah
Greg,cheerios is tasteless
Greg,you're saying everything is too sweet
Greg,i think maybe you just like mild flavours
Greg,either tasteless or too sweet
Greg,maybe thast why you like french toast crunch
Greg,bruh. i never said frootloops was too sweet
Greg,frootloops is S
Greg,that we can agree on
Greg,high A
Greg,jsut cause hte basis for S tier is frosted flakes
Greg,if we put frootloops in S we gotta make a new tier above S
Greg,frosted flakes becomes so spongey after like 30 seconds
Greg,yeah thats the best way to eat cereal
Greg,leave it in hte milk for like 1 minute so its no longer crunchy
Greg,thats my second hot take of the day
Greg,no
Greg,This is why we ignore your opinions
Greg,no. crunchy cereal with the slight taste of milk is the best
Greg,so you're rather have mini wheats like right as you put the milk in when the inside is still fully dry
Greg,we fuck mini wheats
Greg,rather than let the milk permeate it
Greg,kuz it's disgusting
Greg,this fucker eats his mini wheats dry
Greg,
Greg,mini wheats is disgusting
Greg,wtfd
Greg,benson your taste in cereal is so shit
Greg,at least i have a tongue kuz i can actually taste the honey in the honey nut
Greg,im aware theres honey in honey nut
Greg,i jsut still do not enjoy it
Greg,also. more people here prefer crunchy cereal here.
Greg,im no longer on hte milky vs Dry cereal debate
Greg,mini wheats are good
Greg,they sweetness doesn't go well with the milk. if you're unfortunate enough to have 3% it tastes even worse. at that point you're eating cream with laxities.
Greg,im like 90% sure your tastebuds jsut finna dont work
Greg,you out here saying everyhitng too sweet
Greg,if it has even a semblance of flavour
Greg,i'm probably more sensitive to sweetness than you are. also not everything is too sweet. plus i never said mini wheats was too sweet.
Greg,
Greg,ok maybe that i coulda worded that better
Greg,mini wheats tastes like frosting. which doesnt go well with milk. it's like mixing mint and chocolate
Greg,bruh
Greg,you ever heard of mint chocolate chip
Greg,or andes mints
Greg,i have. but mint seems to ruin chocolate for me
Greg,I think your taste buds are broke
Greg,this guys taste buds def broke as hell
Greg,does cilantro taste slightly like mint to anyone here?
Greg,shit tastes like soap
Greg,soap* i meant soap
Greg,link the teirlist website
Greg,for cereal
Greg,nvm found it
Greg,
Greg,lucky charms i used to like.
Greg,but i cant eat it anymore.
Greg,krave is probably my favourite
Greg,and if the nesquick cereal was here it'd go in A teir
Greg,wrong
Greg,so wrong
Greg,i really like my milk.
Greg,if i'm gunna eat frosted flakes i'm gunna dump my milk with my unsweetend dark roast coffee
Greg,"bruh honey nut cheerios definitely ""ruins the milk"""
Greg,i see your point. but it's not as bad as frosted flakes
Greg,benson you put raisin bran over corn flakes
Greg,you opinion literally has negative validity
Greg,Devon you don't get to speak
Greg,actually shut up chris your shit taste extends beyond cereals
Greg,atleast benson kept his terrible taste localized to cereal
Greg,
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,easy as fuck dude
Greg,all we needed was one less chris

Greg,
Greg,time to bring stacks of cash watch out
Greg,fearless ideas now that's a class i wanna take when i come up with ideas the amount of fear that comes along with them is just simply overwhelming. What a visionary but seriously though Kameron do you need to bring something or is it optional. If it's not optional then bring something that you think is cool and come up with a way in witch it effected you.
Greg,lol
Greg,fearless ideas is like an ad campaign for the umd campus
Greg,"social activity, e.g. G A M I N G"

Greg,10 mins
Greg,How's the novel coming along
Greg,"@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home Just played another game of Agricola, this time with the revised version (the one we played was the original), and thought you might want to hear my thoughts. 
1. The revised version is definitely an improvement upon the original. Everyone at the table had useful cards to play and some decent synergies; card quality just felt higher overall.
2. I think revised version + draft would be even better, as to allow for even better card synergies.
3. Restocking the spaces in the physical version is way less tedious than in TTS (not much we can do about that though).
4. Having a plan for food and getting it setup before the first harvest is VERY important, as having to waste actions on food later is painful when better action cards flip.
5. Overly focusing on one thing is bad. One player went totally in on the farming strategy and ended the game with 11 grain and 7 vegetables (max scoring is at 8 grain and 4 vegetables). While this is impressive, all the excess crops didn't help in the score department and this player didn't win.
6. I overall had a lot of fun and think we shouldn't give up on this game if we can find a way to use the revised edition cards."

Greg,yeah but I still have a small amount of hope
Greg,and if nothing else it's visually amazing
Greg,"and from talking to people who know more about the current guilty gear and more from people who've played the demo of the new one, it's still looking like a solid game, just not really in the same vein as the previous ones (apparently this one is just gonna be ""better street fighter"" if it continues in its current state)"

Greg,"How long after being locked in a grocery store would it take you to steal food to eat, with the assumption that you eventually be let out of the grocery store"
Greg,Wouldn't it make sense to eat as soon as you got hungry and just pay for it when they come back
Greg,you have no money
Greg,when you got locked in the store someone took your wallet aswell
Greg,then whats he doing there
Greg,are you dumb
Greg,I would eat once I was hungry. There is no way they could charge me for a crime if they locked me in. I would win.
Greg,browsing
Greg,what are you winning
Greg, Cops are gone 
Greg,The court case
Greg,They would settle it with me. They would have serious bad press to worry about if they locked me in. They would probably pay me to keep my mouth shut and not care if I munched a few chips to keep myself alive.

Greg,"Ike is too one dimensional, Bowser is pretty matchup dependent, and Toon Link isn't good enough."
Greg,Maybe I could give Pikachu another try.
Greg,just play ike he not bad
Greg,He was the character I kept coming back to
Greg,maybe
Greg,Ike + Bowser would be a fun duo
Greg,hey i like both of those characters
Greg,"Is that a ""back off"" type of message?"

Greg,as in
Greg,i can help you play both of those characters
Greg,true

Greg,Oakland is a really shitty city
Greg,First impression
Greg,Genesis boy pog
Greg,How was the flight?
Greg,I was gonna have nothing to do all morning but one of my friends was on my flight so we played friendlies for a few hours
Greg,Nice
Greg,It was super short it kinda felt like I didn't go anywhere
Greg,It was like an hour and a half
Greg,Yea that's not too long
Greg,It would've taken like 10 hours to drive tho
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Short flights always feel weird cause the check-in and waiting for the plane always takes longer than the flight itself
Greg,Yeah
Greg,We had a bunch of smash players I know on the flight
Greg,Fat Goku sat like 2 seats away from me
Greg,That's sick
Greg,Who did you play friendlies with
Greg,Also I'm mega bored just waiting for my ENT
Greg,Just sitting in a room
Greg,My boy culex

Greg,Did you have a fucking stroke there buddy?
Greg,was laying on the floor and reached up to try and type games
Greg,i heard oakland is kinda ghetto
Greg,Just found a steaming shit at work
Greg,On the floor
Greg,
Greg,??
Greg,What the fuck
Greg,
Greg,I am never using one of the restrooms by the foundry ever again
Greg,These people are ANIMALS
Greg,Bruh who does that in the space x IBM apple Lockheed Martin Uber office headquarters
Greg,You forgot Google aswell
Greg,No I didn't
Greg,i cant believe berkshire hathaway would hire someone who does that
Greg,also yes Oakland is pretty ghetto be careful
Greg,it's like 90% very sketchy and after the first time I went there I decided it'd be the bright move to just uber both in and out
Greg,also like two people were murdered there in the four months I was nearby
Greg,Yeah I'm not planning on being anywhere other than the bnb and venue after today
Greg,You forgot Amazon and Netflix
Greg,i heard there was a round 1 near there
Greg,@Jed when you game?

Greg,@solarlight come
Greg,ok
Greg,did someone say furry owo
Greg,Did someone say furry 
Greg,
Greg,The Aussie player I'm seeded to play is fucking good
Greg,But he's in my bnb and I'm getting the download
Greg,stream it
Greg,"Just played some more agricola, this time with the school board game club. Really enjoying the game."
Greg,board game club 
Greg,More like
Greg,Board game club 
Greg,Lmao my sponsor really out here dropping me the morning of genesis
Greg,Oof
Greg,Place higher than 16th and show them who they shouldnt have dropped
Greg,It's only cause I called him out about getting the money he said I'd get in October
Greg,Hmm that sounds illegal on their part
Greg,I mean he said that atk doesn't deserve me and doesn't think I'm a good fit
Greg,Do you have email/message chains?
Greg,Well he sent me the money today
Greg,Aight that's not too bad then
Greg,But it still might be worth going public with provided that's not a breach of contract
Greg,"Yeah just kind of stupid that he'd just drop me with no discussion, I've literally been with the org for over a year now and joined at it's conception"
Greg,So here's the funny thing
Greg,"""They didn't pay me and when I gave them shit about it they fired me for 'not being a good fit'"" is kind of a huge red flag"
Greg,I never signed a contract so I can say whatever I want
Greg,"Like, wanting money from your sponsor is kinda how sponsors work"
Greg,I'd say don't go overboard but it's an important cautionary tale
Greg,Yeah I'm probably gonna tweet and just say that I've been let go and the circumstances behind it
Greg,Yaw
Greg,"Be honest, don't be overly vicious (don't want to alienate potential future sponsors), but also make it clear that there appears to be a correlation between wanting to be paid and not being a good fit"
Greg,Yeah
Greg,F. Sorry to hear that Jed
Greg,"It's okay, I was kind of thinking about it anyways cause I was getting really frustrated"
Greg,It took bemmie almost 5 months to get me the money
Greg,And I would ask kindly once a month
Greg,Until last month u started to show I was getting upset
Greg,Cause he keeps running all these tournaments with thousands of dollars on the line
Greg,How much money did you get anyways?
Greg,150 for one event
Greg,Which is better than what most rivals sponsorships do
Greg,also do they handle travel fees and stuff?
Greg,So it was a hella good deal and that's why I wanted to stay
Greg,They way that they did it was they reimbursed half my flight
Greg,But I had to buy the ticket and send them the reciept
Greg,are they still gonna reimburse your genesis travel?
Greg,I highly doubt it
Greg,We barely discussed it
Greg,"I said ""I assume genesis reimbursement is out of the question as I still haven't gotten the reimbursement from heatwave"""
Greg,yikes
Greg,That's a big F
Greg,"although now he has an excuse to be like ""yup not paying for genesis"""
Greg,"also that's probably something worth mentioning in your post ""so I flew out to genesis while still on the team and they're not gonna be paying my flight"""
Greg,Yeah I'm gonna write it up after I've thought about it
Greg,One of my now ex teammates is at genesis and I'm gonna try and find him
Greg,Not sure if this is real homies but stay safe

Greg,I just saw an article by a veteran Terraforming Mars player that said building cities is one of the worst strategies in the game. I'm not sure how that could be given that my city spam in the second game we played seemed so effective.
Greg,I guess we never really understood how to play the game at all
Greg,Someday I'll probably try it again
Greg,"Now that I'm thinking about it more, I feel like I actually probably liked the game, but that feeling was overshadowed by the rather negative table atmosphere and how much everyone else seemed to be miserable."
Greg,"Logically, it has two of my favorite things in a game, drafting and engine building, so I should probably like it."
Greg,"I think that if I could be shown/show myself with more plays that the game has more viable strategies than city spam like that article claims, I could probably have fun playing the game."
Greg,@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home

Greg,hbox has really bad di
Greg,also marth puff on dreamland looks practically impossible
Greg,even tho zain is winning
Greg,he is just way better
Greg,Hbox is carried by puff
Greg,I feel like he's just gotten really complacent
Greg,he dragged puff up for years
Greg,but now that he's on top he's getting lazy
Greg,I would say he actually used to be carried by puff even more than now. See his skill with other characters over time as evidence.
Greg,his secondaries have always kinda sucked?
Greg,They are way better now
Greg,but in general I'd say he is the reason he's carried by puff
Greg,"not only is dreamland busted for puff, but it also kills the momentum of the other player"
Greg,like he made puff into a character who can carry
Greg,and then stopped pushing her as a character
Greg,and now he's letting his past work carry him
Greg,and now everyone's figuring out how to counter that
Greg,bro he literally never used the sing punish on marth until like last year
Greg,thats how little he innovates
Greg,"wow, one (1) new piece of tech"
Greg,naw it was evidence for your point moron
Greg,yeah I was agreeing
Greg,he stopped innovating after like 2017
Greg,hbox is honestly so lame
Greg,I would say that at that point in time he was carrying puff but now he's just letting puff carry him
Greg,the worst guy to be the best melee player
Greg,never plays friendlies
Greg,at least people are figuring him out
Greg,doesnt innovate or play to the meta
Greg,camps when he is losing
Greg,like I think unless he starts working hard again he's not holding onto #1 for another year
Greg,think about how unstoppable he looked in early 2019
Greg,and now he's got a whole bunch of frequent losses
Greg,look how much data he gets by playing games on dreamland
Greg,"zain, wizzy for a bit, hbox sometimes, especially leffen"
Greg,i dunno if winning a game on dreamland vs hbox is even a good idea
Greg,"Go Zain, saving melee"
Greg,"and he's got hax, leffen, fiction all chilling down there"
Greg,it'd be fairly insane if he even makes grands
Greg,dammit I want to make dinner but there's like no sets I don't want to watch
Greg,I guess I'll wait for hbox fiction
Greg,fuck which set is next
Greg,can I just leave during the ad break?
Greg,but it's probably gonna be leffen hax
Greg,smash gg says that leffen hax is next
Greg,darn
Greg,HAX$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Greg,tweet incoming 
Greg,THE ROOM WAS COLD
Greg,idk if the box should be leagl. in my opinion the set should be replayed?

5th ain't too bad to start my comeback off with I guess. We'll take it all things considered!"
Greg,SPAM  THIS  CRUSTACEAN  FOR  HBOX  ELIMINATION 
Greg,Hax is abusing puff's lackluster defense very well
Greg,HAX$ IS NUTS

Greg,welp
Greg,that was a choke and a half

Greg,"Beating the World’s Best at Super Smash Bros. Melee with Deep Reinforcement
Learning"
Greg,@solarlight
Greg,Andrew what is this?
Greg,
Greg,Can you read?
Greg,"One particularly clever player found that the simple strategy of crouching at the edge of the stage caused the network to behave very oddly, refusing to attack and eventually KOing itself by falling off the other side of the stage. One hypothesis to explain this weakness is the lack of diversity in training - since the network only played against old copies of itself, it never encountered such a degenerate strategy"
Greg,absolutely large brain
Greg,RIGHT
Greg,Its a cool paper

Greg,?
Greg,so
Greg,fuck essays
Greg,True
Greg,Settle a debate https://www.strawpoll.me/19347040
Greg,THe is our high five phrase
Greg,"Vote Now! [Up high, down low fakes out high five too slow] [Up high, down low, in the middle fakes out high five too slow]"
Greg,It’s supposed to say the fake out not “the is our” autocorrect
Greg,Yo wait
Greg,who the fuck out here saying in the middle
Greg,Cause Ashley says you don’t say in the middle but I’m saying you gotta day in the middle so that you have proper rhyming sequence
Greg,Literally never met anybody why doesn’t do in the middle
Greg,Tf
Greg,Wait
Greg,Also Chris don’t vote I want to know what the general populace does and you have time and time again shown you don’t do a single normal thing
Greg,How does saying in the middle make it a rhyming sequence
Greg,It literally doesn't rhyme
Greg,"Cause it it goes 
Up high (not rhyming line)
Down low (setup for the rhyme)
In the middle (additional line to keep the rhymes on alternating lines)
Too slow (Rhyme Payoff)"
Greg,If you lead a single not rhyming line into two back to back rhyming lines it messes with the flow
Greg,I guess that makes sense
Greg,Listen to any song
Greg,Okay
Greg,I feel like your thing works better in text
Greg,I feel like it works better in practice aswell
Greg,Nah
Greg,Cause the rhyme part is tacked onto the middle line
Greg,So it doesn't feel like payoff for the down low line
Greg,you feel
Greg,The only additional payoff of not adding in the middle is that if you fake out the low high five it leaves their hand lingering in a downward instead of horizontal motion
Greg,You don’t need lay-off on every like
Greg,Payoff*
Greg,Line*
Greg,"Like example
Life is old there (spacing)
Older than the trees (setup)
Younger than the mountains (spacing)
Blowing like a breeze (payoff)"
Greg,There no payoff on the mountains line cause it’s added as spacing
Greg,I think the clear distinction here is that your example is a song while the high five action is not
Greg,bruh who be saying in the middle
Greg,You're trying to turn it into a song
Greg,probably dumb people
Greg,But it doesn't need to be
Greg,It’s not a song it’s a rhyme sequence though
Greg,Genuinely never met people who didn’t say in the middle until now tf
Greg,Well here's the thing with that
Greg,You mostly do this joke to kids
Greg,So your family probably played it on you using the middle version
Greg,You aren't exposed to how other people say it because the other people you are exposed to in your life probably realize that you are too old to fall for the joke
Greg,I feel like the desire for there to be patterns in the rhyming sequence is a natural thing not something you learn like why “tock tick” sounds worse than “tick tock” there’s an actual like psychological reason for that
Greg,Ergo you never meet anyone that would say it the other way
Greg,Idk about you bro but I still be pulling the fake out high fives to this day
Greg,That’s how we got onto this topic of discussion
Greg,in the middle breaks the rythymic sequence which imo sounds worse
Greg,though ive heard both
Greg,That just wrong tho
Greg,It doesn’t break the sequence the fuck?
Greg,I think it could be due to kids not picking up on the rhyme the way you propose it though
Greg,Not adding it breaks the sequence
Greg,It's more clear that the rhyme is intended when the middle portion is excluded
Greg,To kids at least
Greg,What dumbass kids are you dealing with
Greg,The fuck
Greg,"yeah ""up high"" ""down low"" and ""too slow"" are all two syllable"
Greg,If you play a kid country roads are they not gonna notice trees rhymes with breeze
Greg,"""in the middle"" is 4"
Greg,It’s the bridging line Greg
Greg,Cause I was doing it to Ashley and when I said “down low” she slapped my hand with the might of a thousand suns then was like “why didn’t you try and pull your hand away” and I was like cause I pull it away in the middle and that’s how we got here
Greg,That line is from way back I just had to keep deleting and refusing it cause Greg kept saying some@dumb shit that I had to respond to right away
Greg,Hence why it doesn’t make sense in the conversation
Greg,fwiw i’ve always heard it w/ “in the middle”

Greg,im telling god
Greg,I'll do what I want.
Greg,god says eye contact before marriage is sin !!!
Greg,"and besides, not all the chapters in the SK one are NSFW. (I marked the ones that are, so for the people who don't want that stuff can steer clear)"
Greg,he does not...
Greg,ye i can see that
Greg,"everything else is just soft ecchi, if anything at all"

Greg,"2 & 5 have soft ecchi

Greg,being gay isnt a meme

Greg,"you can't just fetishize lesbians and be like ""GAY MEN CAN GO BURN IN HECK"""
Greg,you dodnt know if im a girl though
Greg,"if it's just ""bros"" being ""bros"", no signs of gay any where, I'm cool with it"
Greg,frostbite said trans rights

Greg,@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home @Rotomotorz Just finished an in person game of Terra Mystica. I played the Fakirs to handicap myself but still got  133. Pretty happy with that score given how bad they are.
Greg,wow the coronavirus is really getting to max
Greg,I should have gotten 136 but I forgot to take water 1 for my sanctuary
Greg,
Greg,tragic
Greg,OH SHIT HES SO WIDE
Greg,network wide asf
Greg,"Carpet flight, earth 1, and dwelling round meant I scored 44 points in the last turn plus another 8 for passing with the sanctuary stronghold bonus card with both in play."
Greg,"On another note, I'm even more happy with the score when I consider I had both neighboring colors in play (which the Fakirs especially dislike)."
Greg,welp I got a new celeste PB but I'm real sad

Greg,What the fuck
Greg,Tragic
Greg,damn that sucks
Greg,Bro that’s fucked
Greg,hunt him down
Greg,How does one manage to hit the side of a car in a driveway
Greg,These are the people you share the road with everyday
Greg,"Could of been an animal, or some dude with a bat"
Greg,bro how an animal bouta do that
Greg,there aren't like bison walking around in florida
Greg,Humans are animals
Greg,
Greg,Human drive car
Greg,car hit car
Greg,i mena a deer could do that
Greg,^
Greg,That was my original idea
Greg,It looks all scratched up though at the bottom so it looks like it was acutally a car
Greg,how tf did that other car even get onto your driveway tbh
Greg,like wtf were they doing
Greg,the funniest thing about it is that I dont have a normal driveway
Greg,like my car was pretty far from the road
Greg,Draw a diagram
Greg,
Greg,Wow
Greg,That was really fast
Greg,and detailed
Greg,You should be an artist
Greg,but real talk I was sideways up by the door
Greg,and even then the road is a good couple feet behind me
Greg,Damn sucks dude
Greg,"Okay, theory time"
Greg,Some guy needed to turn around
Greg,so he pulls into your driveway to do it
Greg,hits your car
Greg,Theory time over
Greg,nah apparently people heard the guy speeding down the road and slamming into my car
Greg,but no one did anything

Greg,Who here has played the Steam version of UNO?
Greg,I wasn't even aware that there was a steam version of UNO. I've played it on tabletop simulator though.
Greg,"I think it's only like... $5-10...?
I've seen a few YouTubers play it and it actually looks kind fun."
Greg,It's got special rules you can enable... And different game settings with special cards.
Greg,"For example, 7s & 0s
Play a 7, you swap hands with someone
Play a 0, all hands rotate in the direction of the turn order."
Greg,Frostbite uno night @Tabletop
Greg,ok
Greg,uno?

Greg,jesus fuck what
Greg,I'm watching dbfz world tour finals
Greg,grand finals
Greg,go1 vs fenritti
Greg,"game one: go1 perfects fenritti
game two: fenritti perfects go1"
Greg,what the actual fuck
Greg,was it like 100-0 both games lol?
Greg,yeah
Greg,lol
Greg,do you know how rare a single perfect is in dbfz?
Greg,insanely rare
Greg,I don't watch this game that often but I've literally never seen one until today
Greg,well i mean if you can 100-0 i cant imagine its that rare
Greg,"""If you can do it, it's not rare"""
Greg,a 100-0 is a guaranteed perfect
Greg,
Greg,you jsut gotta land hte first hit
Greg,you dingus
Greg,when i say 100-0 i mean you hit a guy when hes full health and fully kill him without dropping combo
Greg,"you can only 100-0 with sparking (which is a once-per-game thing, and also often used defensively) and hella bar"
Greg,and only on one of their three characters
Greg,most of the time it's 2-3 openings per character
Greg,so you pretty much need 5-9 straight openings to perfect someone
Greg,"depending on your team (damage-heavy vs neutral/mix-heavy vs balanced) and meter management (meter for damage vs meter for mixups, sparking for defense vs damage vs pressure)"
Greg,nerd
Greg,@Master Memers I have it on good authority that @The Rona is the suck dick man
Greg,https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/662012908284280853.gif?v=1
Greg,COCK
Greg,you're the suck cock man?
Greg,cheese is kinda insane at sm64
Greg,
Greg,oof
Greg,I got an A so I'm fine but I feel bad for the others
Greg,(this was a Gen Chem II test)
Greg,it might get curved
Greg,I've never seen a math/science test get curved
Greg,don't you curve by the highest grade tho
Greg,I remember one of my old housemates calling her parents about getting a 28% on a midterm but that was okay since the class average was 22%
Greg,lol
Greg,damn
Greg,and that was engineering
Greg,but I guess it might depend on the school for what gets curved
Greg,"but still, odds are if it gets curved max's grade goes up"
Greg,I know my school curves business classes like accounting
Greg,"Also, my grade was 100 so it cannot go up"
Greg,ah well
Greg,This was supposedly the easiest test too
Greg,The class may shrink to a tiny size by the end of the semester if this trend continues
Greg,my guess is that those 6 people who failed are dragging the average down since most people seem to have done aight
Greg,they've probably given up on the course but haven't dropped yet
Greg,"meanwhile, in courses I wish I could drop, currently working on an assignment where this is one part of it:"
Greg,I have no idea what 'layout 2' is
Greg,this is the only use of the word 'layout' in the entire assignment
Greg,hmmm
Greg,so I've just decided to make my best guess at what they want here
Greg,"unfortunately, the whole assignment is like this"
Greg,so I'm making my best guess at like... half
Greg,this course is terrible but also mandatory
Greg,What course is this?
Greg,Software Requirements
Greg,it's all about how to plan software
Greg,"with the caveat that this is not, in any way, how anything works at any actual company"
Greg,sounds useless
Greg,it's a course about the pipe dream of how we wish people told us to make software
Greg,and the prof uses the word 'requirements' more than the word 'the'
Greg,it's 80% common sense and 20% buzzwords
Greg,I wish I still had classes where I could pass the tests on common sense alone
Greg,yes but also it's mind-numbingly boring and a shocking amount of work
Greg,I've been working on this assignment since like 2
Greg,ouch
Greg,most of that time has been consulting other people in the class and trying to put together a picture of wtf the prof wants us to do
Greg,Unclear instructions are the actual worst
Greg,You seem to get them a lot of the time
Greg,at this point we've all given up actually figuring anything out and we're just doing going with our best assumptions about what he wants
Greg,I hope he enjoys the eight pages of BS he's gonna be getting
Greg,also I hope that he stops doing the thing where whenever he posts the slides for a lecture it's all the slides for the whole course up until that point so you have to scroll through an increasingly long series of slides to reach the new stuff
Greg,"I may complain about my school a lot, but the one thing I will give it credit for is that the professors are of shockingly high quality on average."
Greg,mine are usually solid but there's generally one disaster per term
Greg,I've been told that's because my school attracts people who like the teaching part of being a prof rather than the research part.
Greg,"and yes, it's usually the researchers"
Greg,im zack's professor
Greg,Someone in my chem group chat just says he got a zero on the exam
Greg,i hate zack
Greg,I hope he read that one wrong
Greg,He did indeed
Greg,he actually got an A
Greg,the only test i've ever passed was a test on how to fail tests

Greg,GG
Greg,"there were group fuckups and I had to move to another group, they didn't change my group assignment in the system but said they'd match my final project's marks with the new group's"
Greg,that never fucking happened
Greg,final project was worth 30% of my grade
Greg,and with a zero on the system
Greg,I failed the course
Greg,thank god I have emails from the prof/TAs saying they'd do it
Greg,I've probably spent several hours over the last few weeks deliberating on what game to buy (board game) now that I have access to a place to play them weekly. I feel like my inability to choose is killing me but these games are just so expensive.
Greg,B U Y  T H E M
Greg,coward
Greg,
Greg,
Greg,"so quick question. Any of you guys know of a kind of sweet candy/chocolate that has cream in the middle? I know it sounds like a weird question, but I'm doing research.

and I want a serious answer......"
Greg,like a twinky?
Greg,"maybe, but not quite"
Greg,I mean I might know the thing you're thinking of but just not immediately connecting the dots
Greg,"I'm not sure if something like this exists.... but I'm thinking of something that's kind of like the length of a churro, but cream filled"
Greg,crunchy? soft?
Greg,
Greg,maybe more like crunchy?
Greg,these things?
Greg,yeah something like that
Greg,it would be better if they were like a type of candy though.... but I can make this work if nothing else
Greg,happy to kinda sorta help
Greg,
Greg,What is this for??
Greg,a valentines gift
Greg,
Greg,For someone?
Greg,"yeah, a co-worker"
Greg,Oooh :0
Greg,good luck!
Greg, love is in the air
Greg,huzzah ya boi is getting the runaround by campus faculty
Greg,still stuck waiting on that one prof to fix my grade so that I'm not failing
Greg,found out that half the systems show me failing another course but the other half show me passing it so I'm also waiting on a fix for that
Greg,found out that my credits from the summer school I took back in 2016 never got transferred so I'm short six credits (equivalent to one full-year course) to graduate unless I can get that fixed and no one seems quite sure how that process is gonna work so I keep getting passed off to new people
Greg,and now all the faculty offices are closed so instead of shlepping all around campus I have to send emails which are inevitably gonna get ignored for awhile
Greg,Damn that shit must be fucking infuriating hope you get it all sorted out
Greg,yeh
Greg,I've at least done all I can for today until people email me back
Greg,Zack boi where are you going to work?
Greg,Where do you WANT* to work?
Greg,fuckin anywhere at this point
Greg,but honestly in the here and now my focus is on making sure I can dodge all these weird administrative fuckups and actually graduate
Greg,"cause it'd be real awkward to get hired and be like ""surprise I gotta do one more term of school cause my credits ain't got transferred properly"""
Greg,Well just remember you don't have to be honest on your resume. You can put you have your degree then explain the situation
Greg,IF THEY FUCK UP
Greg,I might be wrong but I feel like resumes are just ice breakers
Greg,"And if you are honest but can't even get your foot in the door, you will never have a chance to prove yourself "
Greg,GOOD LUCK BUDDY
Greg,I would hire you 
Greg,Just finished my first calculus 2 test (was an online class so I could have procrastinated in to next Monday at the latest) . Now I can go play terra mystica again tomorrow guilt free

Greg,it's the kind of cold where going outside hurts your face
Greg,"like actual pain, not just cold"
Greg,Why the fuck is gotta be -22 on the day I wear the distressed denim smh
Greg,Bro I just saw some mother fucker in shorts
Greg,ballsy
Greg,I respect it
Greg,I knew someone in elementary school who did that
Greg,killed like 2/3 of the nerves in his legs and he doesn't feel cold anymore
Greg,so I think he might still be doing it
Greg,Man's crazy
Greg,actual baller move tbh

Greg,Yo  @Zain good luck at summit
Greg,yeah thats fine
Greg,thanks i appreciate the support
Greg,History might be in the making with this set
Greg,Axe might actually lose to a marth
Greg,@Rotomotorz
Greg,Axe is crazy
Greg,
Greg,I wish rivals was as big as melee
Greg,"Rivals is a cool game, I would also like it to be better known"
Greg,Wrastor is maybe my favorite platform fighter character ever

Greg,sauce
Greg,what version?
Greg,20w06a snapshot
Greg,its not gonna be up tonight since imma leave in like 30 mins ish
Greg,but ill sauce you ip and you can join the next time its up 
Greg,
Greg,I'll play mc
Greg,okay I'm back @Cs:go
Greg,"i would be interested, but I think people are gone"
Greg,You're dumb
Greg,is that a yay or nay from you smith
Greg,"When I ordered something from Amazon it said the delivery would be Sunday. The page was still up and it said it could ""ship by Saturday if you order within the next 6 hours!"" So I cancelled my order and ordered again lol. I have no idea why this happened."
Greg,The time gap between the orders was like 9 hours
Greg,"So I'm going to visit my brother over reading week, checked and apparently there was supposed to be a 2-3 hour wait to get through customs"
Greg,There was no line at all
Greg,My flight doesn't leave for another two hours
Greg,F
Greg,I'm sitting in a very overpriced restaurant staring down this bottle of fiji water they leave at every table and presumably have to pay like $15 if you open
Greg,go to a cheaper restaurant and feast on something?
Greg,They're all super expensive
Greg,Or moderately expensive and serve tiny portions
Greg,Feels Airport Man
Greg,And I haven't eaten yet today and my flight keeps getting delayed
Greg,So I'm willing to pay the five extra dollars for bigger better food
Greg,sounds like a plan
Greg,hbox legitimately looks unbeatable
Greg,he dominated 4 players who have historically gave him at least a bit of trouble
Greg,i dunno if fox beats puff tbh
Greg,not in b05 with sdi existing
Greg,I think fox is the best character against puff whether he wins or not
Greg,Puff is just overpowered. Puff gets to play brawl while everyone else plays melee.
Greg,amsa is sick
Greg,like he lost but he's sick
Greg,oh hope he gets better
Greg,@Cs:go
Greg,"If we get some peeps, sure"
Greg,ok
Greg,@trashpanda risky rain with me and devon
Greg,?
Greg,@Homies  we play MvM at some point tomorrow
Greg,Tomorrow is Summit finals day
Greg,No
Greg,Your point
Greg,I'm going to be occupied with that
Greg,Just don't
Greg,In addition to other things
Greg,Watch vods
Greg,
Greg,no
Greg,
Greg,max gay
Greg,
Greg,this summit final bracket is hype
Greg,zain plup
Greg,facts
Greg,hbox maNG
Greg,anyone can win tbh
Greg,maNG
Greg,BUMPED CAPS
Greg,again
Greg,also 9 top 10 players left
Greg,no m2k lol
Greg,wait there are like no top sheiks anymore
Greg,And then I said
Greg,Penis
Greg,yeah same
Greg,i think that if fox players win game 1 vs puff/marth they should just sd 4 times in the counterpick
Greg,like no meme
Greg,its more important to preserve momentum than to maybe win on the counterpick
Greg,I think people prone to tilting might do this but I don't think everyone should.
Greg,i do
Greg,at top level
Greg,its literally not worth the risk
Greg,fox never beats zain on fd
Greg,vs marth maybe I could see that everyone should
Greg,not vs puff though
Greg,even if you win dreamland
Greg,you have to play it again
Greg,giving hbox so much momentum and info
Greg,Maybe I'm biased because Dreamland is my favorite stage but I would never forfeit that game.
Greg,and it burns the fox player out
Greg,making them prone to make more mistakes in future games
Greg,The fact that this is even a discussion means the ruleset is broken
Greg,bans
Greg,id like to see the stats
Greg,of how much hbox wins on the fox's counterpick
Greg,after winning the second dreamland game
Greg,i guarantee its real high
Greg,why not just stand still on the counterpick
Greg,like honestly losing dreamland the first time might be better sometimes
Greg,plup is godlike
Greg,I think this is the first win vs Hbox since Plup won genesis
Greg,hbox hasnt lost so badly since mang0 at birthday bash
Greg,ggs
Greg,dreamland 
Greg,so dumb
Greg,puff dies early
Greg,that was a good tourney still
Greg,Yeah
Greg,Sup everyone?
Greg,hi
Greg,hi
Greg,Sup mrd256?

Greg,

Greg,
Greg,
Greg,"Some guy left a comment on the video like ""We reviewed your channel and have decided you aren't a good fit. Just leave this here to bring some closure"""
Greg,Even though I know it's a troll it still bothered me

Greg,ok
Greg,"In an extremely ill-advised decision, I'm currently at a casino with my brother"
Greg,Time to lose $80usd
Greg,win money
Greg,Good advice
Greg,Just think of gambling as paying for entertainment rather than a way to earn money
Greg, 
Greg,Well yeah
Greg,Also a way to make him stop bothering me about going to the casino
Greg,"I've heard that helps soften the blow of the inevitable loss and prevent going in too much to ""win it back"""
Greg,Yeah
Greg,I've committed to losing $80 and if I lose less it's an accomplishment
Greg,Good mindset
Greg,Bit of a roller coaster so far but atm I'm only down $4
Greg,Nice
Greg,$4 is not much
Greg,Lost like $50 on one hand tho
Greg,Playing poker?
Greg,he was playing blind and got triple sevens
Greg,What moron plays blind
Greg,"Yeah, Texas hold em"
Greg,Texas hold em is the only valid poker
Greg,Hes doing really well
Greg,Could afford to play blind one hand
Greg,Poker is the only gambling I would consider since I can use skill to win
Greg,"Yeah, to a point at least"
Greg,I'm alright at the game but have never played with real money
Greg,I've played for really small money once
Greg,First time at a casino tho
Greg,Im out lol
Greg,Pocket kings lost to pocket aces
Greg,rip
Greg,Did you lost all $80?
Greg,"@here 
Heyyyy so I’m doing a research paper on the the youth’s political ideology, and would love it if y’all could fill out my survey :)

Greg,Very quick
Greg,Super fast
Greg,wait thats what smithy looks like

Greg,"No, he's left"
Greg,This is Zack we are talking about
Greg,"@Homies I've recently discovered a game that I think could be great fun for our group if everyone is willing to learn it. It features highly asymmetric factions (apparently balanced), information trading, treachery, and alliance making and breaking. Tonight I am pretty free if people want to get together and play it on tabletop simulator. It plays best with 6 players so please let me know if you are interested. (The game is Dune)"
Greg,@Advanced Memers
Greg,"Players interested so far: Max, Chris, Devon, maybe Greg"
Greg,@Rotomotorz Were you interested?
Greg,maybe but depends on when u plan to play
Greg,"This evening, I suppose around 8:00 since that is when devon gets back"
Greg,I never said that
Greg,Where’s your proof
Greg,Please don't be difficult
Greg,I had that as an option so I could remove anyone who didn’t vote within the right demographic
Greg,Because I put it on a subreddit
Greg,Ty for taking my survey tho :)))
Greg,Dune sounds dumb
Greg,But any of you boys heard of zune?
Greg,Them boys play music
Greg,"Bruh a customer spent like $300 in the store and was like “I gotta stop spending so much money, I guess this is better than spending it on mafia city” and I was like “the phone app?” And this mf says “yeah I’ve sunk like $3000 into it with nothing to show for it”"
Greg,BRO
Greg,What
Greg,Why
Greg,No fucking clue
Greg,Who looks at an ad for that game

Greg,you're mother
Greg,you're mother
Greg,I would make one but I dont know how
Greg,so yell at @Zain to do it
Greg,"I mean I can do it, but wouldn't it be better to have the server hosted by someone who lives closer to everyone cuz I'm not that close relative to a lot of people in the server"
Greg,Sounds just like someone who doesn't want to set up the server
Greg,We should probably pick a modpack first though
Greg,Do we want a more vanilla friendly pack? An rpg-esque pack? A tech heavy pack?
Greg,I mean I'll set it up doesn't matter to me and tech heavy in my opinion
Greg,"Check out crackpack 3, All the mods 4, engineer's life, valhelsia 2, enigmatica 4"

Eventually realized that I'm arguing that the author is trying to show that a major component of good is to seek knowledge beyond that which is directly handed to you, and reaching that conclusion required me to put down the story he wrote and go read Plato to understand those four sentences.

But what finally got him the ban was unapolagetically using 'faggot' and 'gay'. This went over poorly with our TOs, who are:

Greg,"Jed, you are dumb"
Greg,especially at community college
Greg,correct
Greg,@Max they probably do not care
Greg,This was one of the classes 3 major assignments and not meeting the visual aid requirement is an instant F. If they care so little they would just fail a major assignment why would they even be there.
Greg,It's not like they didn't prepare a speech. The speeches were actually pretty alright.

Greg,"@Homies I have invented a social deduction game that is quite different from any that are currently popular (Secret Hitler, Avalon, Mafia, Werewolf, etc.) and would like to playtest it this weekend if possible. It features such things as a globally known person on the good side who cannot be killed and leads the investigation, the possibility to kill for the bad guys with risk involved for doing so, and an interesting bluffing dynamic of ""confinement without execution""."

Greg,The 1 coin goes on the 6 coin
Greg,@Mr. Airplane
Greg,Devon has 1 extra coin
Greg,@Eric Working From Home
Greg,I would be mad about that takeback
Greg,Sorry Devon
Greg,Did Devon do anything?
Greg,I think you skipped his turn?
Greg,ah
Greg,ok
Greg,Science victory or nothing

Greg,something by zach
Greg,like
Greg,68 points
Greg,Took care of Chris's income
Greg,Don't forget your 5 points
Greg,@The Rona Don't forget you can burn power
Greg,If you need stuff
Greg,Place on brown unless you need 2 towns there
Greg,Digging for 3 workers is a terrible idea
Greg,burn power
Greg,You could use double dig power action and build on both reds
Greg,@The Rona
Greg,actually you need to build a dwelling on the empty space first
Greg,so they are both in range
Greg,yeah
Greg,Now just try and get coins
Greg,I did it
Greg,For you
Greg,It moved from bowl 1
Greg,Did you tell him you can turn workers to money?
Greg,You should highly consider the 6 coin bonus
Greg,Yeah I think so
Greg,Do you want me to get your income Chris?
Greg,2 power
Greg,"Now you can easily prep at least 1 town for the town bonus round, maybe even 2."
Greg,This is a bad impression of the game for Chris @Mr. Airplane
Greg,sure
Greg,Chris and I were making such a great plan
Greg,rip game

Greg,this game is such a blast
Greg,no smile
Greg,this lookin mega weeb tbh
Greg,a wee bit
Greg,it's sooooo fuuuuun thooooo
Greg,What do you use as a controller for this?
Greg,"I'm using my stick, but it's pretty straightforward so I'd assume just about any controller or keyboard would work"
Greg,"it's 8-directional movement, 4 attacks, and one 'move slower so you can be more precise' button"
Greg,so just about any modern or modern-ish controller should be fine
Greg,I might get it later today
Greg,I've been bored
Greg,Though I wouldn't be able to talk while playing
Greg,"aight, lemme know if you want to play at some point (the multiplayer is way better than the single player imo)"

Greg,Gyazo
Greg,this some bullshit
Greg,What blizzard game do you even play?
Greg,cod
Greg,what do you guys think of these character designs?
Greg,One thing you might want to consider is that the girl's shirt looks like an Easter egg pattern. Whether or not you want that is up to you.
Greg,very saturated and clashing colors
Greg,Easter Egg pattern?
Greg,oh yeah it does lol
Greg,
Greg,it looks like a typical design you'd find on an easter egg
Greg,kinda like this
Greg,oh Shirt! I thought you said Skirt.
Greg,"but yeah, that's what the original shirt looked like, so I went with it"
Greg,but i think the dark blue on gray is no bueno
Greg,Original?
Greg,the values are way too similar you can hardly see the design
Greg,allow me to explain
Greg,I build my character designs by using bits and pieces from other designs...
Greg,this is where I got the shirt and jacket
Greg,Those colours work better
Greg,I agree ^
Greg,better contrast
Greg,thats what im sayin
Greg,so maybe change the color of the vest?
Greg,No
Greg,The actual shirt itself
Greg,the shirt or the design
Greg,on the shirt
Greg,make it contrast
Greg,really? I think the black and blue go well together
Greg,either the pattern colour or the base shirt colour
Greg,they're way too similar
Greg,the design fades into the shirt
Greg,hmm alright
Greg,but i would also recommend toning down the vest as it is much to bright and saturated
Greg,also the male character's hair is wayyyyy too blue and bright as well
Greg,he looks like Sonic
Greg,how about a white shirt instead of black?
Greg,also the whole thing is a bit generic
Greg,yeah that seems better
Greg,
Greg,yes better
Greg,maybe now you should change the socks too
Greg,maybe now she needs white socks
Greg,"and I agree. The guy looks a little too monotone. I want the blue hair, so what other colors should be changed"
Greg,yeah I'd say white socks + black on the shoes
Greg,but i dont think the blue hair would work with anything
Greg,it doesn't suit the art style
Greg,well maybe idk
Greg,"something else to keep in mind....... these aren't ""natural"" designs either. Like no one could have a ponytail that long and think (don't take that out of context)"
Greg,omg
Greg,i know this bro
Greg,i make really unrealistic designs of blue dogs
Greg,but there still are principals of character design
Greg,"I'm aware. Like I said, I think the guy looks a little monotone, so I feel like some colors should be changed"
Greg,probably the bandada
Greg,"other than his hair, because I want to keep the blue hair"
Greg,bandana
Greg,i didnt even see it at first since it matched the shirt color
Greg,"hmm, ok. Or I could change his shirt."
Greg,true
Greg,but if you change the shirt make sure it doesnt clash with the vest or pants
Greg,"but I feel like something other than black. Because then he'd look a little too ""dark"""
Greg,well he's got blue jeans. Almost anything goes with blue jeans
Greg,i also think the shoes look a tad out of place since there is not brown anywhere else
Greg,maybe you could make something else brown
Greg,this is where I got the body for his design.
Greg,wow you barely changed a thing
Greg,he also looks very generic
Greg,like all harem protagonists
Greg,yeah and thats not good
Greg,give him a mohawk
Greg,are you making a harem?
Greg,Not with this guy
Greg,i think the outfit is just kinda plain
Greg,needs something else
Greg,"Well I gave him a scarf, so I thought that added something"
Greg,yeah but idk I personally dont like his vest thingy
Greg,but thats just me
Greg,anyone else?
Greg,I think you're a weeb
Greg,are you an artist at all?
Greg,or are you just making designs to get other people to draw them
Greg,No. Hence why I use other design pieces to make mine
Greg,hmm
Greg,I can't even draw lines without screwing them up
Greg,well thats because you probably havent really practiced
Greg,that's how bad an artist I am
Greg,bruh
Greg,everyone starts off bad
Greg,you're bad for AT LEAST a solid year
Greg,usually way longer
Greg,did it also come across to you I don't feel like becoming an artist. I'd rather not spend a year practicing a skill I'll never use
Greg,fair ig
Greg,you didnt say that at all tho
Greg,"but i mean,, art isnt really a skill you never use if you, yknow, draw"
Greg,Eh
Greg,i find a lot of fulfillment in drawing for the sake of drawing but i know not everyone's like that
Greg,but its not a pointless skill
Greg,Did I ever show you guys my commissions I had done?
Greg,you showed us one
Greg,fair
Greg,lol what kind of response is that
Greg,well there's just one more I plan to get done when his next session opens up
Greg,oh so you've only had one done so far
Greg,I've actually had 2
Greg,1 character done twice
Greg,i thought one of them was a group photo
Greg,"there's the group photo, but there's also the single one, which I had done first"
Greg,this one was more a test
Greg,aaa thats pretty cute
Greg,I do really like this one.
Greg,same shirt design as your new character tho
Greg,this character I mean
Greg,because I use the same one lol
Greg,huh?
Greg,"I wanted to give her a short sleeved shirt with a vest, and that was the best I could find"
Greg,"tbf, her design was made long before the one I just showed you"
Greg,yeah but that doesn't mean you should give your other characters the same clothes lol
Greg,"eh, whether I give these guys full life or not is still in the air. I just made them to kill some time"
Greg,fair ig
Greg,use that creativity tho bro
Greg,this is the girl I plan to get commissioned next.
Greg,who is probably my favorite character of them all
Greg,:o cute
Greg,"A lot of my fans of the fanfiction I write also like her. In fact, in a poll I did on my server, she ranked the highest out of all the others"
Greg,how many people you got in that server? :0
Greg,You have a big enough fan base to have a discord server?
Greg,wow
Greg,"let me check the action number, cause I can't remember"
Greg,"Well I've got 34 on the server, but not all of my fans are on my server"
Greg,if I look at my ff.net account (which is where I post the fanfic)
Greg,"the story has 26 followers, so add that to the 34 on my server"
Greg,wow
Greg,Wow the vanguard wiki even has a page for your alternate universe
Greg,WHAT
Greg,ARE YOU FR
Greg,how'd you find that out???
Greg,google
Greg,please send me link
Greg,"plus there are the ones who don't follow the story or on my server, but I know they're reading it."
Greg,Those I can't count
Greg,did you add that page yourself
Greg,"if it's on the fanon wiki, than yes, I added it myself"
Greg,https://cardfightvanguardfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cardfight!!_Vanguard_X
Greg,Cardfight!! Vanguard X
Greg,Cardfight!! Vanguard X is a fan fiction series made by mrd256. It acts as a sequel to G that takes place 20 years later.
Greg,there's a link to the fanfic on this page
Greg,"just a fair warning, the fanfic might contain a few missing words here and there, and a few grammar mistakes, but I'm trying to get better"
Greg,well idk anything about the original story so
Greg,you actually really don't need to understand the original story to get this.
Greg,"since it takes place in the future and has it's own story.

also, if they recall back the events in the canon, then I throw in a short summery of what happened"
Greg,"for example, in one of the most recent chapters, two canon characters, who are friends with the heroine's father, explain how they became friends with him, which are actual events that happened in the original show."
Greg,"still, i think its odd to read fanfiction if you've never watched/read/whatever the source. I know some people disagree with me though !"
Greg,"eh, I somewhat agree with you"
Greg,the story also has over 400 views and 31 reviews
Greg,What's most valuable lesson you learned while writing this? I plan on writing a book in a few months so some tips would be appreciated.
Greg,"something is, write every character like they are the protagonist of their own story."
Greg,"obviously you have you story's main protagonist, but in reality, everyone leads their own life"
Greg,"So you should reflect that in your stories. Give them personalities that flow with their back stories, and maybe put a little twist on them if you can"
Greg,My story has 4 maybe 5 point of view characters so I'll definitely need to do this
Greg,"for example, maybe a character had a tragic back story, but they act all happy and cheerful"
Greg,maybe use that happy and cheerful personality as way for them to cover up their pain and despair
Greg,"and when their tragic event is brought up, you (the viewer) sees a different side to them you never thought they had"
Greg,that can be a key to make 2 or even 3 dimensional characters
Greg,I've been planning my story for almost a year so I hope it goes well once I start
Greg,I always think of ideas for stories but this one is my favorite of them all
Greg,I've never had one develop so fully before
Greg,"all stories can take time, but sometimes, a good strategy is to release 1 chapter/1 volume at a time. This will make the view anxious or curious as to what's gonna happen next"
Greg,"also, it gives you time to learn what you did wrong in previous chapters and learn from them to improve future ones"
Greg,I'm still trying to decide if I should release my story chapter by chapter or wait until the whole thing is done. I'm leaning towards waiting until its done so I can present the best possible product.
Greg,I'll probably have a small number of test readers who read it live though
Greg,I kinda like to do both
Greg,"if I have a story that's fairly short, I'll just release the whole thing at once"
Greg,"but Vanguard X is a pretty long story, spanning across a total of 4 seasons, and 2 spin off series."
Greg,"where the story lies right now, I'm entering the last chapter of the first arc of season 1"
Greg,I've never written a serious project like this so I have no idea how long it will end up being
Greg,well your first project is always gonna suck. No matter what it is
Greg,I do know it has three main parts though
Greg,I hope to avoid that
Greg,I have done some less serious projects to practice
Greg,I didn't mean to discourage you
Greg,"For me personally, I try to keep a positive mindset."
Greg,I think it leads to the best results.
Greg,That is true
Greg,and that's something I envy about you.
Greg,"lately, I've had a hard time staying positive with all the crap that's been going on in my life"
Greg,Good luck getting though it
Greg,It's actually gotten to the point where I need to see a therapist
Greg,I've already got an appointment scheduled next week
Greg,I've never been to therapy so I don't know much about it but I hope it helps
Greg,me too
Greg,"well it's about time for me to hit the hay. I have work tomorrow, so I'm gonna try and get some sleep"
Greg,good night

Greg,$10 for 20 images
Greg,@Feral Nebula ?
Greg,This is my opportunity
Greg,wait what?? how are we supposed to make them
Greg,Don't ask others
Greg,ok
Greg,
Greg,450 is a lot
Greg,I dont care how you make them
Greg,You just need to draw in a single color over the vessels
Greg,and another color over the brain reigons (blue)
Greg,you need 450 of the first image you sent?
Greg,you can probably just use photoshop filters
Greg,I have to create all this fucking training data so I can make a computer automatically do it
Greg,Wait
Greg,You want me to recreate the same image
Greg,with different colours?
Greg,you are basically just creating a label that says
Greg,HEY
Greg,these pixels are blood vessles
Greg,Ok wait hol up
Greg,and these other pixels are NOT blood vessels
Greg,okay send me the files
Greg,it just has to be too colors
Greg,wait i wanna do some too
Greg,uploading them to g drive rn
Greg,its going to take all night
Greg,because I was a fucking retard with the way I extracted these
Greg,and I don't want to redo it lol
Greg,"they don't all have to be done by the same person, right?"
Greg,ehhh honestly it would be best if the same person did it because I am willing to bet there are variations in the way different people would label these images
Greg,so anyone who is interested can fight amongst the other people who want the job
Greg,Ill let the free market work in my favor here 
Greg,I NEED IT
Greg,DIBS
Greg,
Greg,I just need my labelled images ASAP and as cheap as possible
Greg,Gonna make fat stacks
Greg,
Greg,i bet i could do it faster than you
Greg,race
Greg,Wait so
Greg,You have a big foler of a bunch of images similar to this
Greg,"or like, each start from opposite ends and meet in the middle"
Greg,That you just need in different colours?
Greg,Are they all coloured in purple and yellow?
Greg,Oh wait
Greg,a
Greg,minute
Greg,I get it
Greg,Actually small append
Greg,BLACK for vessels
Greg,WHITE for brain reigons
Greg,and yes I am willing to have a race
Greg,Ava will start from the bottom of the folder
Greg,chris will start from the top
Greg,wait how is that a race then
Greg,wtf
Greg,whoever gets halfway through first has to do the rest?
Greg,what ab out me
Greg,whoever reaches the halfway point first
Greg,okay chris starts at the top
Greg,dober starts at the 1 /3
Greg,OKAY FUCK THIS
Greg,that seems like a waste of time tho for whoever doesnt win
Greg,Just fight amongst yourselves and decide who gets the job
Greg,i'm going to bed!
Greg,what format are the files in?
Greg,JPG
Greg,bruh
Greg,needs more JPG
Greg,smh bad business man just abandoning things
Greg,Wrong
Greg,I am going to let the market work in my favor while sleeping
Greg,When I wakeup someone will have won the contract by out bidding there components for who can do the work cheapest and quickest  Or if you guys are really smart you will conspire by electing 1 person to officially take the job. Demanding a hire wage for that person. Then splitting the work amongst yourselfs
Greg,  Food for thought  ? 
Greg,i thought you said one person had to do them all

Greg,especially cause someone I know and usually beat is seeded 14th (he actually enters these so they know how to place him) so I have a chance to make some upsets
Greg,welp I ended up seeded to fight top seed in winner's r2 so that went poorly
Greg,we also somehow had 90 ping
Greg,but I don't think that would have changed the results one bit

Greg,"There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.
All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.
IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.
IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.
Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.
Cognitive ability is substantially heritable, apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent."

Greg,they're all
Greg,locked behind fucking paywalls
Greg,what the fuck is this bullshit
Greg,have u tried sci-hub
Greg,I might have to
Greg,but mostly I just want to highlight the sheer incompetence of this professor
Greg,"like, maybe he has memberships to all these random ass journals on software development"
Greg,but his students sure as hell don't
Greg,also our summary/review thing has to be 2 pages and the only one of these papers I've found that isn't pay-to-read is only two pages including pictures
Greg,the summary would have to be longer than the original
Greg,shoot me
Greg,haha good luck with that
Greg,anyone have a video of kameron?

Greg,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence.
Greg,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence. Then by continually bouncing off the slippers and the bed we can generate enough momentum to clip through the floor and skip the window sequence.

Greg,?
Greg,@everyone games cs ow ?
Greg,@here
Greg,games
Greg,SURE
Greg,i guess thats a no from everone else lol
Greg,So I just thought of an interesting challenge.
Greg,"I call it the ""Bottom Tier Challenge""

You take the lowest tiered character in some kind of competitive fighting game (like Smash), and you keep doing random join ups with random people, until you get a legitimate victory using that character.

here's what counts as a legitimate victory. You have to win via the conditions set in the rules. You cannot win via a timeout, or your opponent disconnects.

You stop play at all before you get a legit win, you fail the challenge."
Greg,very neat idea
Greg,Have you won this challenge in any games?
Greg,I have not.
Greg,Also @Max you were up pretty early this morning
Greg,mha finale p good

Greg,is the game good?
Greg,no
Greg,dont get it
Greg,alright tuning into 5 streams rn
Greg,is it any more effective to have multiple streams open?
Greg,idk if this works but in theory you could open a stream and mute it so your twitch default opens streams muted them jsut go to the valorant directory and middle click each stream to open them all then ctrl+tab through them all so they are all marked as open then just minimize hte window
Greg,cause you dont have to actually have hte stream unmuted on an active window to recieve drops
Greg,@Cs:go

Greg,but with all the cs xp i think he will pretty well
Greg,oh also you missed that one game where Kameron went like 32-6
Greg,he was going pretty ham last night
Greg,i can't account for games that i have not played in

- Greg || Jed
- Ben
- Ben ^2
- Smithy
- Max"
Greg,oh boy apparently the Valorant anti-cheat has root-level access to your computer 24/7
Greg,we have all handed riot our entire computers
Greg,@The Rona I forgot to add zain and since you were last you are out 
Greg,Sounds like Zain's problem
Greg,‍♂️
Greg,Nah dude
Greg,"so yeah even if they weren't already, China now owns your entire computer"
Greg,uh
Greg,"""Ring-0 is essentially the lowest level something can run in.

Running in this permission level essentially means that a given driver has full administrative access to your operating system before it even throws a login screen. It can monitor the boot process, check every driver and device that loads at boot (at least after it's loaded), and can run arbitrary code without any input or knowledge from the user.

It doesn't matter whether you're logged in or not, or whether you've even played the game recently. It is ALWAYS running."""
Greg,and uninstalling Valorant won't uninstall the monitoring
Greg,so we have to reinstall windows?
Greg,wait i'm not sure that's true
Greg,you can uninstall it manually but it's a separate thing
Greg,and significantly more complicated
Greg,I saw someone talking about this in a stream too
Greg,It is true
Greg,wtf
Greg,Wait so am I not in the 10 man
Greg,Rip
Greg,and posts about this stuff is getting banned on r/valorant
Greg,Also people were reporting performance loss in other games due to this
Greg,so what do I need to delete?
Greg,whoops
Greg,@Matt I forgot about max too
Greg,Max has your spot sorry buddy
Greg,Whew
Greg,Accept the Chinese Communist Party into your heart
Greg,
Greg,this is riots response to it
Greg,yeah what do I delete
Greg,Why did you delete that
Greg,"If you delete it, then you can't play the game"
Greg,"there's some control panel level stuff, here's the thread I'm seeing: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/g0gdug/riots_trusted_valorant_mods_deleted_a_thread/"
Greg,r/pcgaming - Riot's 'Trusted' /Valorant mods deleted a thread about...
Greg,"9,084 votes and 1,544 comments so far on Reddit"
Greg,
Greg,but then yeah you can't play the game
Greg,"TL;DR Yes we run a driver at system startup, it doesn't scan anything (unless the game is running), it's designed to take up as few system resources as possible and it doesn't communicate to our servers. You can remove it at anytime.

Vanguard contains a driver component called vgk.sys (similar to other anti-cheat systems), it's the reason why a reboot is required after installing. Vanguard doesn't consider the computer trusted unless the Vanguard driver is loaded at system startup (this part is less common for anti-cheat systems).

This is good for stopping cheaters because a common way to bypass anti-cheat systems is to load cheats before the anti-cheat system starts and either modify system components to contain the cheat or to have the cheat tamper with the anti-cheat system as it loads. Running the driver at system startup time makes this significantly more difficult.

We've tried to be very careful with the security of the driver. We've had multiple external security research teams review it for flaws (we don't want to accidentally decrease the security of the computer like other anti-cheat drivers have done in the past). We're also following a least-privilege approach to the driver where the driver component does as little as possible preferring to let the non-driver component do the majority of work (also the non-driver component doesn't run unless the game is running)."
Greg,I'd rather not play the game then have my data mined
Greg,"The Vanguard driver does not collect or send any information about your computer back to us. Any cheat detection scans will be run by the non-driver component only when the game is running.

The Vanguard driver can be uninstalled at any time (it'll be ""Riot Vanguard"" in Add/Remove programs) and the driver component does not collect any information from your computer or communicate over the network at all.

We think this is an important tool in our fight against cheaters but the important part is that we're here so that players can have a good experience with Valorant and if our security tools do more harm than good we will remove them (and try something else). For now we think a run-at-boot time driver is the right choice."
Greg,thats the riot response
Greg,Lets review the fax
Greg,bullshit
Greg,literally no one else does this and it's functionally malware
Greg,riot is conviniently owned by 10cent
Greg,they can run anything they want on your computer with this
Greg,it's also not stopping hackers
Greg,"and even assuming there's no malicious intent, the second this gets cracked fuckin anyone who wants gets root level access to your computer and can do malicious things with it"
Greg,antivirus software does this
Greg,yes but our antivirus software isn't owned by a company owned by China
Greg,a country famous for not invading privacy for malicious purposes
Greg,"also, people are already beating the anticheat"
Greg,so it's not insane to assume someone has or will soon beat the security and boom we're all even more compromised
Greg,apparently this is an article response to it https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/dev-null-anti-cheat-kernel-driver/
Greg,/dev/null: Anti-Cheat Kernel Driver - League of Legends
Greg,We’re protecting some of Riot’s upcoming games with new anti-cheat systems.
Greg,yeh I still don't really trust it
Greg,"because no matter what it's still extremely sketchy to need that level of access, especially if it's not working"
Greg,yeah if we are going this tin foil hat then there is literally nothing any one could say
Greg,yup
Greg,but there's plenty of good reasons to tinfoil hat on this one
Greg,Yeah literally
Greg,namely the censorship of r/valorant
Greg,"on the other hand, there's no real reason to panic cause odds are your computer's already hella compromised"
Greg,fusion doesnt use a vpn when he torrents all of those games so i doubt hes scared of anyone
Greg,ok if we are worried about the big bad tencent and china then we must be worried about all of these companies as well right https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/
Greg,Every game company that Tencent has invested in
Greg,A quick reference of how China's largest tech conglomerate has quietly expanded into videogames.
Greg,@Jed
Greg,have my spot
Greg,@Zain
Greg,"yes, yes I am Zain"
Greg,but none of them have installed root-level permission software on my computer
Greg,Zack you can get so much information off of discord but why do you still use this application when Tencent has invested in it as well
Greg,"like, on one hand, I'm still gonna play Valorant because I assume everything I do is already tracked by at least someone sketchy because realistically you can't avoid it, but on the other hand, I think people should understand what's going on

also are you insane in comparing what they can get out of discord vs. always on root access"
Greg,if we are worried about selling our information or compromising or security this would priority number one no?
Greg,"discord can't run any code it wants with any level of permission on my computer without me knowing about it
discord can't see every single thing I do on my computer
discord can't look at every single file on my computer at all times"
Greg,"discord can see what I put into discord: messages, voice, occasionally video, what game I'm playing, and the files I post"
Greg,ok sure
Greg,facts dood

Greg,"Copied from another server: PLEASE do not play TF2 or ANY source games in the meantime. A serious leak of source code has been reportedly leaked into the public. If true, it means source games are easily compromised and you should not play them at the moment.What this means is cheaters could potentially install programs or get information from your PC through source games if true.(Allegedly) the developer of cathook has discovered a way to RCE (remote code execute) on TF2 just by you being in the server. This allows anyone who does this to run any code on your computer, including viruses, turning your game into an aimbot, or deleting your items. Playing any source game, including TF2 is dangerous right now, and we suggest not playing until there is some kind of fix for this."

Greg,i dunno
Greg,how do you. not know

Greg,That guy is 100% guilty
Greg,I don't care that I have not played the game

Greg,The first two are basically RNG
Greg,wtf
Greg,wtf
Greg,I have no idea what to do
Greg,I'm so confused
Greg,
Greg,This is not what he is referring to
Greg,We played a game in class months ago where we stood in a circle and played some adding game
Greg,I do not remember the exact rules though
Greg,wtf is this class it sounds really retarded
Greg,It's public speaking
Greg,Not like you could figure that out from the test questions though lol
Greg,owch
Greg,You know something's up when you don't know even remotely what class someone is by looking at test questions
Greg,This is the least relevant test I've ever seen
Greg,Most of the questions are normal but like 20% are garbage like above
Greg,"I don't know if what I said sounded insulting, but believe me, I'm only insulting the test."
Greg,
Greg,ikd max but that sounds like an insult
Greg,I wrote it poorly
Greg,I was trashing the test
Greg,not you
Greg,if i had to take a guess i'd say its some type of philisophical course but like
Greg,lol
Greg,"Sorry Benson, I only realized it could sound like an insult towards you like 30 seconds after sending it"
Greg,Definitely was not my intention
Greg,non taken. just poking fun at your wording choice
