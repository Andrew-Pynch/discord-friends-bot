Jed,"Ok so all this server is a hub for friends to play games, chat, hangout, and genrally have fun. This server is ment to be a replacement for the orginal frostbite server that has become very large and unwieldy. The orginal frostbite server has also become very inactive and stagnate as a result of its size. That is why am hopeing to keep this community relatively small so that we can be active and have fun."

Jed,?

Jed,cause the other company got bought out
Jed,so now I can watch youtube
Jed,cause the new one doesn't block it
Jed,your parents blocked youtube?
Jed,yea
Jed,what
Jed,why
Jed,my parents have a router extension thing that has customisable filters
Jed,cause they don't trust me apperently
Jed,they were so caught up in what they could do that they didn't stop to think about whether or not they SHOULD
Jed,also what do they think you're doing on youtube? watching porn?
Jed,yup
Jed,I'm like 95% sure that's not something you can do
Jed,I'm gonna assume that youtube filters that kind of thing
Jed,also do they not realize there are much better sources of that kind of thing?
Jed,"besides, something I've learned from pranking friends on school computers is that it's impossible to block ALL of the porn"
Jed,although you might not want to tell your parents that
Jed,oh I know that
Jed,oh
Jed,I don't get their reasoning
Jed,but its not blocked now

Jed,I did
Jed,its the chronological order all the marvel movies take place in timeline wise
Jed,How was this timeline created?
Jed,people with alot of time on their hands
Jed,i mean it makes sense
Jed,starts with first captain america and ends with guardians of the galaxy
Jed,What the hell is Cloak & Dagger?
Jed,unreleased stuff
Jed,clock can travel into different dimensions and dagger kills people
Jed,its a little tv series that hasnt come out yet
Jed,"""clock"""
Jed,cloak*
Jed,lol
Jed,I wasn't doubting the validness(?) of the timeline
Jed,I was just wondering how they determined it
Jed,Because I am interested in that stuff
Jed,for the released stuff its kinda obvious
Jed,since they use specific dates in the actual movies
Jed,so you can jsut be like oh yeah
Jed,there it is
Jed,and for the unreleased stuff i think its jsut Theory Crafting
Jed,okay so the list of currently Released Movies we need to watch in Order is...
Jed,"Captain America 1
Iron Man 1

Jed,I gotta go to work but legit think about it maybe over march break @The Rona
Jed,not all in one day obv
Jed,I'm down
Jed,yo lit
Jed,ill try and figure out which ones are on netflix and which ones ill need to pirate
Jed,bad
Jed,???
Jed,Pirating things is wrong
Jed,it is stealing
Jed,and if everyone did it no more movies would be made
Jed,just think about that
Jed,http://puu.sh/ujKXT/d8381d16a8.jpg
Jed,and by pirating something when not everyone else does it is like saying you are better than them
Jed,most things you dont even need to pirate
Jed,you know photoshop?
Jed,and other adobe products
Jed,i have the files from adobe im using their files
Jed,not third party
Jed,i just know how to mess with the security on it and make my free trial go from lasting 7 days to 1000 days
Jed,that is stealing and wrong
Jed,no third party programs or software adobe jsut has really loose security for being such a large company
Jed,thats on them
Jed,if a store had no alarm system and just a bad lock would it be okay to steal from that store?
Jed,no becuase that is stealing not pirating
Jed,PIRACY IS STEALING
Jed,there is no a finite amount of computer programs or files
Jed,there is a finite amount of objects
Jed,but you still obtain something without payment to the creator
Jed,"Piracy is a Victimless Crime, Stealing is not."
Jed,NO
Jed,if you made something and everyone pirated it you would be very upset becasue you would make 0 MONEY
Jed,"if its a small startup or something like and indie game/film from a small company i will pay for their products and support them if i think its worth my money, but if its a large company like Adobe or Marvel where my 1 Aquisition without payment will not affect them then i feel no shame in doing what i do"
Jed,how can you even defend yourself? you know its illegal and wrong yet you try to come up with reasons why it is okay even though you know you wouldn't like it if someone pirated something you made
Jed,Big companies deserve money for their work just as much as small ones
Jed,im not trying to defend myself
Jed,am i doing something illegal? yes.
Jed,do i feel remorse? no.
Jed,Piracy is Comparable to Jaywalking
Jed,yeah its illegal but nobody cares
Jed,that is so untrue
Jed,@The Rona I mgiht be Busy March 11-15 but im free the other days of march break i believe
Jed,@here games bois?
Jed,maybe
Jed,i'm kinda enjoying my pokemon and chill session ive got going on tho
Jed,you should join me and chris for a pokemans nuzlocke challenge at some point
Jed,Yo boyd
Jed,In a work meeting
Jed,I'm literally never not pirating something
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL It's ok I support your pirating 110%
Jed,thanks fam
Jed,np
Jed,"to put my two cents in about pirating, yeah it's illegal, yeah it's morally wrong, but it's prevelant enough that most companies work it into their assumptions about how much money they can make and at that point it's become so standard that it almost doesn't matter"
Jed,but personally
Jed,Sylki join so we can play my game when doctor comes back
Jed,"I only pirate stuff like books I can get from the library but am too lazy to walk to, old games that I'd be getting second hand so the original creators don't make any money anyway, or software that I already own but it's on my old computer and a massive pain to transfer"
Jed,doc is back btw
Jed,and textbooks cause they're crazy overpriced and there's no way to know if you're actually gonna need them till like 1/3 of the way through the course
Jed,also I'm busy and I'm not gonna be able to play tonight
Jed,okay
Jed,also how do you even pirate a textbook?
Jed,@The Rona Older misha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tSZEMc1CVk

Jed,This picture reminds me of the infinite energy machine I proposed awhile ago.
Jed,Have you heard of M.C. Escher before Quick?
Jed,He's the artist of that picture
Jed,He has a whole bunch of stuff like that that breaks perspective and positioning and it's super neat
Jed,I've only ever heard of him as the person who drew this picture
Jed,I had never heard of him before now
Jed,His stuff is pretty cool
Jed,honestly he's one of my favourite artists
Jed,he fiddles with the ways you have to draw to give the illusion of a third dimension in order to make trippy geometrically impossible pictures and they're always super interesting
Jed,"so I'm studying for a test tomorrow, and the prof posts old tests, and when I was talking to one of my friends who took the course last year, they said this test was basically impossible and everyone did horribly, and I kinda throught they were exaggerating"

Jed,Whooooo

Jed,?
Jed,Go-to play overwatch
Jed,"What is this, a discord for owls?"
Jed,On YouTube
Jed,Send links
Jed,wow the alt fire sounds super OP
Jed,Yeah it does
Jed,She look really good
Jed,Also Bastion is getting a small nerf
Jed,"Instead of 35% damage resistance, they are lowering it to 20%"
Jed,Why do they gotta release the new hero when I have a test tomorrow ;-;
Jed,I don't think its for a while yet
Jed,Is just on ptr thou
Jed,She's on the PTR
Jed,The new hero sounds pretty bad
Jed,How so?
Jed,Her weapon slows her while firing
Jed,Also abilities just sound kinda useless in general
Jed,Non moving shields aren't that useful
Jed,Because people move a lot in overwatch
Jed,Fortify just sounds really dumb
Jed,If you slow down whole shooting
Jed,*while
Jed,Thoughts? @The Rona
Jed,How you gonna sit there and do my ass like that
Jed,I don't think the slowing while firing matters too too much
Jed,Especially since we don't know her damage right now
Jed,Depending on the shield cool-down the non moving might not be a problem
Jed,"The alt-fire seems pretty good, mini grav + hook, and it slows you"
Jed,I have more too add but I am in chem right now
Jed,I think that her abilities are counterproductive
Jed,Shut up
Jed,@Mr. Airplane The alt fire can be used to pull people off of high ground
Jed,also dva slows down when she shoots and she's pretty good
Jed,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Jed,900
Jed,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Jed,900
Jed,"So, her gun it pretty good"
Jed,it's a bit weird tho
Jed,looks like it should be hitscan
Jed,isn't hitscan
Jed,"Yeah, it's projectiles"
Jed,seems strong tho
Jed,"she could be good, we'll have to see"
Jed,i like the gravity thing she has
Jed,welp I was just on a team with a 76 and a mccree who couldn't kill their idiot pharah

Jed,new hero?
Jed,yee boy
Jed,seems pretty cool. I could see playing her with mercy on defense instead of ana
Jed,I'm pretty sure the damage boost from her ult doesn't stack with Mercy's
Jed,that would make since
Jed,I have a feeling she's going to be the go to second tank in a bastion meta
Jed,esspecially on defense
Jed,"I can see her + rein being really infuriating to deal with, cause you're got two decently sized shields with the whole team hiding behind them, if you get too close you have to deal with the rein hammer and if you stay far out you have to deal with her machine gun mowing people down"
Jed,does her grav thing pull through shields?
Jed,it goes through shields
Jed,I don't think her gun has falloff damage
Jed,"nah I mean if you detonate it in front of a shield, will it pull the people behind it?"
Jed,it does for sure
Jed,starts at like 25-30 meters
Jed,wait
Jed,maybe not
Jed,I think it might pull through shields
Jed,I'm pretty sure there is no falloff
Jed,It's just her spread
Jed,spread gets crazy there though
Jed,making you hit less
Jed,I could see people getting crazy environmental kills with her grav though
Jed,like indoor nepal
Jed,I wonder if it pulls through walls
Jed,like Zarya's graviton
Jed,I dont think so
Jed,it looks like it needs los
Jed,You could use it on that wall on Lijang
Jed,If it doesn't need los
Jed,you wouldn't need the wall just shoot it off the stage and detonate it
Jed,true
Jed,Also I don't know if you guys know this but when she uses her fortify ability she gets a 50% damage resistance (I think)
Jed,but that makes me think that it shouldn't be able to pull through shields

Jed,Incoming Ana nerfs

Jed,look at this shit
Jed,I didn't even think it was possible for a bomb to spawn like that

Jed,new sm4sh tier list!
Jed,ROB dropped 13 places
Jed,rip
Jed,gg ROB
Jed,wait actually only 5
Jed,was looking at the wrong old tier list
Jed,Good mistake
Jed,still he's now in the bottom half of the list
Jed,why is sonic 5th
Jed,there's like one player who does ok with sonic ever and he's actually a cloud main
Jed,only 1.5 people do well with falco in melee and he is second
Jed,1.5?
Jed,mango is .5
Jed,westballz is 1
Jed,I see
Jed,and even westballz uses fox for certain matchups
Jed,so maybe 1.2?
Jed,"TIL Samuel L Jackson likes anime

Jed,Samuel L. Jackson Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions | WI...
Jed,"yes, but there's a lot of decent falco players or players with decent falcos"
Jed,you look at the top 50 or so players and there are a lot of falcos
Jed,Isn't ppmd a good falco?
Jed,"you look at sm4sh top 50, first sign of a sonic is at 12th, and the guy barely plays sonic anymore, instead focusing on cloud, and even then he doesn't have particularly good results"
Jed,He's a Marth main yeah
Jed,and the other 3 sonics in the top 50 never make top 8
Jed,rarely make top 16
Jed,"and yet he's over 4 characters who have won majors (mario, mewtwo, marth, zss)"
Jed,also somehow bayo snuck out on top
Jed,she's definately high/top tier but not the best in the game
Jed,don't think bayo's ever done better than 4th or 5th at majors
Jed,yeah her best ever result at a major (even pre-nerf) is 4th and somehow she's considered the best character in the game
Jed,What is the criteria for the tier list  though?
Jed,"it's also funny looking at this tier list in relation to kingston sm4sh, where, based on our current PR (which admittadly has some odd parts), from #1 down through the honourable mentions, we play 28th, 35th, 38th (working on switching to 4th), 36th, 17th, 40th, 7th/43rd (and he's far better at 43rd), 12th, 47th, 23rd/11th, and then honourable mentions play 12th/6th, 6th/37th, and 4th"
Jed,everyone who plays a character in S or A tier (1-12) are all 7th or worse
Jed,Your number 1 player plays DK?
Jed,"I'm pretty sure the list is supposed to be based on how good the character is on paper, which imo is kind of dumb when in some cases there's little to no proof that they're that good in practice, and some characters who suck on paper have pretty good results"
Jed,yeah DKBill
Jed,"DK, Ike, Shulk (trying to get a sheik going), wario, villager, g&w, fox/little mac (way better at little mac, is gonna be climbing back up now that he's switched back), ryu, kirby, captain falcon/zss"
Jed,"not counting the guy working on swtiching to sheik, our only person who plays an s-tier is an honourable mention"
Jed,@Mr. Airplane overwatch comp?

Jed,chikon hard reads - ava and fusion facists

Jed,OMG HE WAS RIGHT
Jed,WHAT THE FUCK
Jed,Lmao lucky
Jed,"Kameron you literally said ""hard reads"" that's the worst possible way to get people to trust you lmao"
Jed,also you trusted smithy super hard and he was involved in every facist
Jed,Kameron that was so terrible stop this
Jed,you dont usually play this game straightfoward lmao
Jed,Kameron you threw
Jed,Eventually though if you play with enough people your goal is to categorize unknown players with know playstyles so saying you need to anticipate plaing with different people is a weak argument

Jed,@everyone It is possible that I have the flu and if I do I may be banished from the computer room although I do have discord on my Ipad. Just a heads up.
Jed,Why banished though?
Jed,so I don't get Ava sick
Jed,tell Ava to get bent
Jed,pull rank on her
Jed,you were there first
Jed,wait you are older right?
Jed,Ava and I hold the opinion that the sick person should concede their rights to the well person
Jed,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring
Jed,we have agreed on this in the past
Jed,I must honor my agreement
Jed,fair enough
Jed,Are you one of those older child supremacists?
Jed,are there any non-first-born older child supremacists?
Jed,just out of curiostiy
Jed,why not just not interact?
Jed,Doubtful
Jed,BECAUSE HE COUGHS IN THE AIR AND ITS
Jed,yes there are sylki
Jed,they are called the younger children
Jed,that's like being a black white supremicist
Jed,"Completely off topic, they are reverting the changes to Ana's heal grenade on the PTR"
Jed,boooooooooooooooooooooooo
Jed,And they are also removing the ability for Zen to apply discord orb through barriers
Jed,that kinda makes sense
Jed,nah im not an older child supremecist im actually the youngest in my family
Jed,i just run the house
Jed,then why did you need to mention that he is older?
Jed,cause he should pull rank on you
Jed,but he does not outrank me
Jed,"I made a youtube banner for my friends channel, any feedback or changes i should make before sending it to her?"
Jed,"nah, looks good"
Jed,"make sure the ""art and animation"" part has the same sized margins as the name"
Jed,cause right now they're tighter and it looks a bit odd
Jed,other than that it's lookin good
Jed,yeah thats my b I see it now too
Jed,also might want to make it not italicized
Jed,they were the same sized margins but then I made the aubtext italic so yeah forgot to account for that
Jed,it's up to you but I'm personally a fan of consistancy with this sort of thing so I'd keep it non-italic
Jed,well im using different fonts aswell for the titlw and subtext
Jed,im trying to break them up
Jed,I have no idea how it'd look but you might also want to try the same kind of text border thing you have going for hte main title on the subtitle
Jed,"different fonts works, but I prefer to keep them in a similar theme"
Jed,k thanks for the advice (not sarcasm)
Jed,"cause already you have different size, positioning, and font, adding the italics is just a tad too much imo"
Jed,"shrugs as always tho it's up to you, trust your own aesthetic sense"

Jed,"A student who was born female felt perfectly comfortable identifying as a man at Wellesley College — until people said he shouldn’t be class diversity officer because he is now a white male. Timothy Boatwright was born a girl, and checked off the “female” box when applying to the Massachusetts all-women’s school, according to an article in the New York Times. But when he got there, he introduced himself as a “masculine-of-center genderqueer” person named “Timothy” (the name he picked for himself) and asked ..."

Jed,I'm guessing armada dropped out
Jed,becuase the only good player on that side of the bracket is the moon
Jed,and shroomed
Jed,was it winners or losers?
Jed,that was winners
Jed,cause I've been mostly watching sm4sh cause there's more strong players in the bracket
Jed,damn that was a crazy sm4sh set
Jed,let's gooooo canada

Jed,but still for someone I'd never heard of
Jed,I don't know why he isn't
Jed,mango never went mario I'm pretty sure
Jed,prolly matchup familiarity?
Jed,like he's just more comfortable fox vs falcon
Jed,I don't think he's taken games with his sheik today
Jed,yes he has
Jed,"not sure tho, mostly been watching sm4sh"
Jed,he took 1 vs shroomed
Jed,and 1 vs hungry pidgeon
Jed,shrugs no idea then
Jed,whose your bet on the winner?
Jed,hbox of course
Jed,the safe pick
Jed,his only threat is m2k
Jed,no one else has even a small chance of beating him
Jed,hasn't m2k been beating hbox lately?
Jed,last set was summit where he lost
Jed,but prior to that was a local where they traded sets
Jed,could go either way
Jed,no player other than m2k can beat hbox
Jed,of moon and shroomed who do you think would do better if they make WF?
Jed,I think shroomed would have a better chance against both m2k and hbox
Jed,barring something insane (equivilant to that random wizzy over hbox) you're right
Jed,but I'm just gonna sit here and hope for more upsets
Jed,wizzy did it twice actually
Jed,once was vs a broken finger hbox though
Jed,I thought Armada was the best tho
Jed,"I woulnd't be super surprised if there were more upsets, it's been a fairly upset heavy tourney, in both games"
Jed,armada's not in the bracket
Jed,armada isn't attending

Jed,"Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world. Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves. All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people.

- George Bernard Shaw"
Jed,"Just playing devils advocate, based on his statement, stability and not being an asshole are the sole domain of the reasonable"
Jed,Which makes this a shaky argument for the unreasonable unless he enforced the importance of both
Jed,And you just didn't include the whole quote
Jed,"I think what is meant by this is that the people who ask ""so why isn't that possible"" are the unreasonable people because most people just accept it can't be done"
Jed,that is all of the quote I was given
Jed,if there is more that is my schools fault for not including the rest
Jed,Fair enough
Jed,I took it as a quote encouraging innovation and asking questions
Jed,which is something I appreciate
Jed,Based on the adapt to the world/adapt the world phrasing I think my point about the importance of both stands
Jed,I don't believe there is more to the quote
Jed,Adapting the world to you is the same as creating things to make your life easier
Jed,like making AC
Jed,the world is now whatever temperature I want
Jed,boom
Jed,Because if everyone tried to change the world to suit them we'd have a mess if t weren't for those who adapt to maintain it
Jed,world adapted
Jed,that is why most people are born with no sense of doing and are lazy
Jed,almost no one actually cares
Jed,Symbiotic n stuff
Jed,those who adapt to the world are mere followers
Jed,they can never make a difference
Jed,See a lot of you guys are very ambitious and want to have a huge impact with your job
Jed,Whereas all I really want is to get a good blue collar job
Jed,Not some field where I am a pioneer and I have to create and research new things
Jed,to each their own
Jed,"I'm not attacking the ones who make a difference, I'm just saying that both types are needed for those differences to become a part of a stable society"
Jed,You can't lead if everyone is a leader
Jed,true
Jed,I can lead but honestly I'd rather have my job clearly set out for me
Jed,but I believe that people are born in a proportion to what is needed by intelligent design
Jed,I get the work done and go home
Jed,"I'm reminded of a school trip I took back in middle school, at one point we had a motivational speaker talking to us, and he did a little ""repeat after me"" thing, going through stuff like ""I will live my life to its fullest"", ""I won't back down from a challenge"", etc, but then at one point he goes ""I will lead not follow"" and the whole room repeats this, with me and a friend just silently looking at each other and trying not to crack up"
Jed,"Most people are content as or would rather be followers, even if they'd say otherwise if you asked them"
Jed,that is accurate
Jed,see opinion above
Jed,"This was mostly in agreement with that (not a personal believer in intelligent design, but with the rest of it)"
Jed,"Personally, if the person I'm following is doing a better job than I could I'm fine not being in charge but if not Ill usually take charge"
Jed,The only issue with being a follower is making sure you are following the right leadee
Jed,"Which was a bitch for group projects in high school, where in my friend group I was at the top end of the bottom half, in terms of organization/leadership ability, so I'd always get stuck wrangling my super lazy/disorganized friends"
Jed,Sounds like every group project I've been in 
Jed,never done a group project but they sound horrible
Jed,They are
Jed,"Or consider our old tf2 team, where I main called for most of it just because I had more experience than you guys, despite not being a particularly great main caller and much preferring to manage a smaller chunk of the team (as roamer or scout I normally micromanage the flank, or as med usually just the combo) and let someone else handle the main strats"
Jed,us people who actually care get killed by those who are okay with a C
Jed,Any decent teacher groups you with people at your grade level or lets you choose your own groups
Jed,And the rare group projects with a good group are glorious
Jed,It's so dumb cause most teachers at my school assign groups
Jed,"One history project though I got the best group ever, like they were down to work on it outside of school and we ended up getting a 100% on it"
Jed,"Also, as a brief aside, some people who are happy with a C care quite a bit but just aren't equipped to do better (and yes they still drag you down but not for lack of caring)"
Jed,@Sak von Sak I invented a new melee crew battle format
Jed,it involves two teams of 6
Jed,and all the characters
Jed,in some way
Jed,"there's a guy in the kingston sm4sh discord whose current name is ""Darwid, Guac Master"""
Jed,what is that?
Jed,^
Jed,I DON'T KNOW
Jed,I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IT IS
Jed,wait actually it's probably derwood

Jed,that means you are on the road to adulthood
Jed,it's basically just that I ate lunch at 4 and I've been snacking all day so I'm completely not hungry
Jed,and as a result don't have the energy for actual food
Jed,Poor Sylki and his poptarts
Jed,what flavor poptarts though
Jed,asking the real questions
Jed,the pop tarts are great but they are symbolic of my life's slow but inevitable descent into chaos and madness

Jed,"lololololol apparently our premier (the person in charge of provincial-level governemtn, don't know what the US equivilant would be, governer maybe?) only has a 12% approval rating"
Jed,lol what a loser
Jed,Bush had a higher approval rating than that
Jed,"and I don't even know what she did wrong, I've heard of no controversial bills, no scandals, no one expressing a particular dislike, nothing"
Jed,fake news?
Jed,but clearly something has gone horribly wrong
Jed,maybe she isn't disliked that much
Jed,"I'm assuming that yeah, she's not the target of strong dislike, just not many people particularly like her"
Jed,alternatively since it's provincial level I just haven't heard much cause it's smaller scale
Jed,but DAMN 12% approval rating is awful
Jed,What's her name?
Jed,kathleen wynne
Jed,or something like that
Jed,dunno exact spelling

Jed,there are big melee tourneys this weekend
Jed,but nope he's going to a sm4sh tournament
Jed,he just got basically jv3'd by a top 20 player
Jed,he only technically didn't jv3 him cause he took 1 damage from being too far offscreen while killing bizz
Jed,does he play ganon?
Jed,of course he does
Jed,he even tried to uptilt

Jed,edgy long hair swordsmen?
Jed,i'd believe it
Jed,somehow neither of them is edgy in game
Jed,boi dunban is extra edgy
Jed,hello???
Jed,how is he edgy?
Jed,other than that he's metal af
Jed,err sorry not dunban i'm dumb
Jed,the other one is edgy
Jed,I mean I only just met him
Jed,he doesn't seem that edgy
Jed,dunban is not that edgy in fairness
Jed,oh oops no spoiling then
Jed,uh oh
Jed,suddenly very worried
Jed,ts nothing major just he becomes more edgy later on
Jed,aight
Jed,dunban is super metal tho
Jed,at least at the start
Jed,oh yeah totally
Jed,but he becomes less edgy as it goes on
Jed,"man burns out all the nerves in one arm fighting the good fight, waits a year, then comes right back in fighting with the other arm and giving zero fucks"
Jed,man runs straight down a cliff
Jed,yeah and then it turns out he's the mentor character like
Jed,
Jed,yup
Jed,the other dude (lao?) is kinda like the opposite
Jed,@Zain what was network id and passowrd
Jed,starts out chill and develops the badass/edgy-ness?
Jed,yeah basically
Jed,lao's got nuts dps
Jed,also true
Jed,"for a sniper dude who keeps going ""it's not my forte, but..."" every time I go for melee combos he's got some damn good melee arts"
Jed,and that one art that buffs everyone's ranged stuff is so good
Jed,especially when my main character does giant laser beams
Jed,yeah lao is super good at the point where you first get to use him
Jed,its been to fucking long since i played x tho liek actually
Jed,I just got it a few days ago
Jed,thus far loving it
Jed,i played it on release which was like a few years ago i think
Jed,yeah I was hoping the price would go down before I got it
Jed,its a great game tho
Jed,ran out of patience
Jed,oh unlucky
Jed,Lin is such a good character
Jed,shame her design is super uncanny valley and all
Jed,just remember she's 13
Jed,"""13"""
Jed,yeah I know
Jed,I'm not saying she's attractive
Jed,she's just really funny
Jed,no i'm just making fun of the super young tech nerd cliche but she's a well developed character
Jed,and she's also funny which is nice
Jed,there's something just.... off... about her model
Jed,it's super unsettling and I can't put my finger on it
Jed,she has bug eyes curved downward which make her look a little off sometimes
Jed,that might be it
Jed,the characters have fairly normal eyes but lin has really big eyes in comparison
Jed,I mean I gave my character purple and teal cat eyes and it's somehow less unsettling
Jed,(also don't ask how purple and teal work together but somehow they do)
Jed,idk mans
Jed,Still the greatest sin this game has is not allowing us to play as Tatsu
Jed,noooo tatsu's annoying
Jed,never been a fan of the nopon
Jed,we need to successor to the heropon
Jed,didn't really like riki either
Jed,riki was hype
Jed,he's comic relief and occasional emotional crutch for melia and beyond that he serves no purpose
Jed,reyn and riki together made it much better
Jed,and he's not even a good party member
Jed,Wait that's actually not true riki is easily one of the better ones
Jed,really? I never figured out how to make him any good
Jed,he's a magic tank and he's got like half the statuses
Jed,yeah but he can't draw aggro
Jed,so being a tank is useless
Jed,he focuses on statusing
Jed,statuses draw aggro i believe
Jed,moreso than big damage
Jed,I could never get him to hold aggro
Jed,dunno
Jed,its nbd unless you're going for like max difficulty runs or something
Jed,shrugs he never did any work for me
Jed,best party for me was dunban fiora sharla
Jed,mad jukes and on the offchance you get hit sharla's got your back
Jed,yeah
Jed,dunban fiora melia is good for most of the game up until you start hitting frequent enemies with strong AoE that just kills melia without her even having aggro
Jed,i kinda gave up on sharla because overheating is a terrible mechanic
Jed,just never play as sharla and you won't notice
Jed,no i notices because she just doesnt do anything
Jed,and she eventually gets a skill that halves the time it takes
Jed,yeah but by then i could just use melia
Jed,eh she just has less overall healing
Jed,yeah but she's got more than enough damage to make up for it
Jed,and in the late game stuff gets AoE that can one shot her without her having aggro and without getting a vision
Jed,and then once you revive her it takes ages to get heals back up properly
Jed,reyn melia shulk/dunban is  how i went most of the game
Jed,yeah that's true
Jed,how on earth did you run reyn melia? melia never seems to give enough heals to sustain him at all
Jed,if the enemies were being aoe happy i'd just play her and play super conservatively
Jed,also can we talk about how shit melia's AI is?
Jed,absolutely
Jed,its terrible
Jed,"if you've got melia in the party, you play melia"
Jed,also sustaining reyn wasn't that bad
Jed,skyfactoryfb
Jed,what elementals did you use?
Jed,"melia had slow heals but she did work, and whenever i ran shulk we had monado shield and stuff too"
Jed,I mean melia's great for 4/5 of the time she's in the party
Jed,I hoenstly don't even remember its been way too longs since I played chronicles
Jed,actually what i think i did was
Jed,i'd healing gift and then hide int he back with water elemental
Jed,and then just try and pooke with fire and electric
Jed,huh I did basically the same
Jed,but it seemed like healing gift couldn't really keep up
Jed,yeah sometimes reyn would get low so i'd have to burn a water discharge
Jed,it seemed like the main issue was just the cooldown
Jed,shrugs
Jed,melia dunban was nuts tho
Jed,i dont remember the specifics my last full playthrough of chronicles was easily over three years ago
Jed,especially if you did water+lightning+wind and he just gets even more agility
Jed,dunban made me feel guilty using him lmao
Jed,he's so good

Jed,2GGaming Playing Super Smash Bros. for Wii U - Twitch Clips
Jed,2GGC: Civil War - Climax - Clipped by Booyahman
Jed,doesn't show the end of the match but it was just a random bair at like 140
Jed,isn't samus bad?
Jed,yeah
Jed,also doesn't esam play pikachu?
Jed,but pika mario is apparently one of the worst high tier matchups in the game
Jed,"the terrible high tier mus are diddy > ryu, mario > pika, um"
Jed,apparently meta knight > rosa but I have no idea why
Jed,this would be like a hype mango vs armada themed tournament and hbox just wins
Jed,rosa > ness might be the worst matchup in any smash game
Jed,"this would be like, if at G3 mango went out to like abate and armada lost to like.... scar"
Jed,wow that extreme?
Jed,I have never heard of the guy who knocked zero out
Jed,then again he made top 96 so maybe a bit better
Jed,it'd be like if armada lost to trillium
Jed,or homemadewaffles
Jed,that would be super funny
Jed,the quivilant for armada to lose to like melee esam and then trillium
Jed,and then for mango to lose to like mafia and abate
Jed,who was ally's first loss?
Jed,trela
Jed,he's somewhere in the 40s I think
Jed,character?
Jed,ryu
Jed,oh actually he's 25th
Jed,what
Jed,oh it's almost a year outdated
Jed,was looking at the older rankings
Jed,trela's 42nd
Jed,"so if I'm gonna follow exact rankings, mang0 lost to Abu and Dizzkidboogie playing dk"
Jed,"actually going by position in the tier list, dkb's zelda"
Jed,and neither of the people zero lost to are ranked so I dunno how to compare it
Jed,there's also a link guarunteed at least 9th
Jed,that's the equivilant of a DK being guarunteed 9th at the most stacked melee tournament you've ever seen

Jed,this falcon player is by far the most fun to watch player I've ever seen in smash 4
Jed,dunno why they're outside
Jed,but yeah fatality's a crowd favourite for a reason
Jed,these are my two favourite players
Jed,I still want nairo to win tho

Jed,wow 3-0 comeback
Jed,hooooooly shit
Jed,fatality is soooo nuts
Jed,that pop off too
Jed,he's so hyped
Jed,that set was insane
Jed,that might have been the best set I've seen all year
Jed,that was also a really short set
Jed,is smash 4 usually that fast?
Jed,like games end quickly
Jed,nope
Jed,that's basically the peak of aggro play in sm4sh
Jed,if only the whole game was like that
Jed,"fastest players you're likely to see are nairo, fatality, SuperGirlKels (tho she's lower level), esam's pika, larry lurr"
Jed,also marss
Jed,forgot about marss
Jed,what about hax
Jed,sm4sh
Jed,not melee
Jed,only problem with fatality is he's really bad at slowing it down when he needs to
Jed,even if someone's doing a great job walling him out he'll keep bashing his head against it
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,I found the mythical 8
Jed,woah
Jed,"commentators currently discussing whether to call the mewtwo combo abandango invented ""The Aba-combo"" or ""The Combo-dango"""
Jed,aba combo is better
Jed,^
Jed,I'm partial to the combo-dango
Jed,that one kinda sounds inappropriate
Jed,so?
Jed,it's so much more fun to say
Jed,esports needs to be esports
Jed,aba-combo is easier to say
Jed,"various sm4sh combos are commonly called ""The hoo-hah"", ""The ding-dong"", ""The beep-boop"", etc."
Jed,"I agree, and it sounds better"
Jed,aba-combo
Jed,we don't do legit sounding names of things
Jed,"I'm not sure if you guys have heard how abadango is pronounced, but the dango part sounds pretty similar to combo"
Jed,it basically ends up sounding like combo-dongo
Jed,which is why it's easy to replace dango with combo
Jed,shrugs
Jed,still more fun to say
Jed,but I'll agree to disagree
Jed,also I kinda just hate you so you know
Jed,kinda have to disagree
Jed,
Jed,DK IN TOP 8
Jed,another top 10 player out
Jed,7/10 have been eliminated
Jed,"only one in top 8 thus far, two of them are in losers"
Jed,wow
Jed,I was watching the DK set
Jed,DK's duuuuumb
Jed,that MU looks brutal tho
Jed,cause sheik has such a hard time killing
Jed,and DK's so heavy and he's never gonna let her get rage
Jed,I don't think mr r got over 100% that whole set
Jed,if you're still watching witness my least favourite character
Jed,fuck ryu
Jed,why?
Jed,"man has a kill confirm at like 65-90 (rage dependant) off uptilt or downtilt, both of which are somewhere between frame 1-3"
Jed,plus it's safe on shield
Jed,and he's super heavy so he always gets a ton of rage
Jed,he has a fast shield breaker so you can't just shield
Jed,on bigger characters (like ROB) he can nairplane you across the stage into a spike
Jed,he has a cancellable super-armour move
Jed,that is also a free setup into his best kill move (aka you die at like 65 if he's got rage)
Jed,rob even has a decent matchup against ryu (pretty close to 50/50 imo) but he's just such a pain to fight against
Jed,"cause ryu has trouble approaching through projectiles, but he touches you and you're boned"
Jed,nairo why would you go to T&C and give ryu a lower cieling
Jed,you have to play so campy against ryu and it's so boring and also terrifying
Jed,noooooo fuck ryu
Jed,8/10 of the top ten eliminated before top 8
Jed,"silver lining, canada made top 8"
Jed,but ugh fuck ryu
Jed,9/10
Jed,9/10 of the top ten out before top eight
Jed,what the hell
Jed,4/5 of the top 5 out
Jed,jesus christ
Jed,who is the one still in?
Jed,dabuz
Jed,#4
Jed,My personal pick for who I want to win is captain zack because bayo is super cool
Jed,or fatality
Jed,hhahahaha clearly you've never fought a bayo
Jed,no I never play this game
Jed,yeah I know
Jed,cool to watch
Jed,like falco
Jed,falco is super bad in smash 4
Jed,too bad
Jed,I'm cheering for fatality or marss
Jed,"safe money is on dabuz, kirihara, or captain zack"
Jed,"but then again, safe bets have very much not prevailed this tournament"
Jed,at the same time it'd be so sick to see T or Hikaru win for the low tiers
Jed,it'd be like DK or Yoshi winning evo for melee
Jed,are they in the same approximate place on the tier list or same level of viability because I don't think that those two things are equal comparing smash 4 and melee
Jed,approximate tier list placement
Jed,basically just did ((sm4sh tier list placement) / (number of characters in sm4sh)) * (number of characters in melee) and rounded it
Jed,but honestly in terms of viability it wouldn't be much different
Jed,then again I guess you could argue that this shakes things up (ie if they're making top 8 clearly they're underrated on the tier list and in general considerations of their viability)
Jed,"to summarize, you see why I don't feel like I'm handicapping myself by playing 33rd on the tier list?"
Jed,"I made it on one team, but I have another tryout later"
Jed,gg
Jed,where is my mans @Mr. Airplane
Jed,@Max if you're not still watching we're in top 8
Jed,I'm watching
Jed,what is it with japanese players and covering their faces?
Jed,it's a thing you do when you're sick
Jed,yeah
Jed,kids at my school do it
Jed,thats nice
Jed,"or if people aroudn you are, and I'm assuming they're all mostly staying together so if one of them's sick they're all gonna cover up"
Jed,well the ones from most Asain countries that is
Jed,also captain zack's american
Jed,oh really?
Jed,rip i wanted to watch top 8
Jed,just physicall y janapense
Jed,but now I have csgo stuff
Jed,"even though I'm not a fan of bayo, I'm still cheering for captain zack cause I really want to see someone who's never won a major win the most stacked sm4sh tourney to date"
Jed,I don't like bayo either
Jed,so unless they fight each other I'm cheering against dabuz and kirihara
Jed,that combo was lit though
Jed,yeah
Jed,I'm a little behind you
Jed,should be caught up now
Jed,what character is that little doll that dabuz has with him?
Jed,I don't like bayo but I do like the way captain zack plays
Jed,I missed it I dunno
Jed,description?
Jed,pink hair yellow and black outfit
Jed,it will probably show up again
Jed,shrugs I'll keep an eye out
Jed,same color scheme as his rosa skin
Jed,but with pink hair?
Jed,yeah
Jed,no idea what the doll is
Jed,dabuz has the freest bracket tho
Jed,he's basically guarunteed 2nd
Jed,I wonder if links super lame style or falcons super fast style will be the dominant style of this match
Jed,T's actually pretty aggro for a link
Jed,but that's till not that aggro
Jed,my guess is that Link's gonna dictate the pace just cause it's Fatality
Jed,man has no chill
Jed,but it might not matter
Jed,we shall see
Jed,see? link's not that lame
Jed,I used to play a lot of link
Jed,wouldn't mind seeing him win
Jed,I'm still cheering for fatality
Jed,even if T might be better against dabuz
Jed,cause a) fatality's awesome and b) rosa link would be soooo slow
Jed,do bombs have kill potential?
Jed,sort of
Jed,bombs themselves don't kill
Jed,but they can set up into kills
Jed,T's nuts
Jed,T's nuts
Jed,fucking insane
Jed,true
Jed,what % chance would you give him vs dabuz?
Jed,I have no idea what the matchup's like
Jed,hm
Jed,70-30 in dabuz's favour
Jed,maybe 65-35
Jed,"I can see the sword being able to contest rosa's range, but then also link can't cover his landings with dair cause rosa's up air is so disjoined"
Jed,I wonder if bombs on shield will mess with luma
Jed,I honestly have no idea how the matchup's gonna go
Jed,the more I think the better it seems for T
Jed,"dabuz is a studier and a learner, and I'm gonna assume he didn't really look at T or Link"
Jed,I'm gonna end at 60-40 dabuz
Jed,my god zack what was that combo
Jed,that was disgusting
Jed,and why are you surprised they ranked this character first?
Jed,yes
Jed,due to the lack of results
Jed,I don't think it's reasonable to say someone's the best character when none of the best players play them
Jed,think about the last 2 years of melee. the top fox placing in a tournament is usually 2nd or 3rd while peach's is 1st and fox is still ranked 5 places higher
Jed,and she may have mad punishes but she loses some pretty key matchups and can struggle to approach (did you see how much trouble he was having getting anything started on dabuz)
Jed,I'm not saying you should do it purely by player ranking
Jed,but it's definately a way to get a partial judgement
Jed,"the fact that there's only one puff and one peach in the top 20 or so (I forget where macD is, possibly top 30) should tell you that they aren't as good as their best players make them look"
Jed,whereas there's a ton of fox
Jed,or the characters are seen as boring by the general public so the people attempting to play them are much fewer in number
Jed,which is actually true
Jed,if you look at the distribution of mains
Jed,oh my goodness the disrespect
Jed,CZ gives no fucks about his opponants' feelings
Jed,zero fucks whatsoever
Jed,I missed it what happened?
Jed,"taunted in game, taunted in real life"
Jed,he's taunted so many times
Jed,fthrow taunt is a true combo
Jed,is her taunt an attack?
Jed,no
Jed,he just throws people and then taunts
Jed,let's goooo fatality
Jed,that was probably a hype set too bad I missed it
Jed,I saw the final kill
Jed,and thats it
Jed,fatality's nuts
Jed,kirihara almost reverse 3-0'd him
Jed,and then fatality turned up out of nowhere in the last 30 seconds or so
Jed,@everyone anyone want to play secret hitler tonight
Jed,maybe
Jed,depends how long this tourney goes
Jed,cause this might be the hypest sm4sh tourney I've ever seen
Jed,I agree with that because I find it interesting and i usually don't care to watch smash 4
Jed,a lot of unexpected aggro players doing really well
Jed,I'm hoping the meta evolves this way in the future
Jed,so apparently T has beaten kirihara (the other best rosa) so he might have a chance here
Jed,how much money does the winner get?
Jed,not sure
Jed,not something I really pay attention to
Jed,did you see how much shield damage that fair did? that's like half the shield
Jed,"on an unrelated note, kingston sm4sh discord has seen the return of our most cancerous community member"
Jed,haven't seen him since last year
Jed,the most toxic person I've ever talked to
Jed,the guy who basically stole from me
Jed,"he hosted a tourney at his house, I knocked him out at 4th, got 3rd, he declared only top 2 get money, then on the drive home (with 1st and 2nd) they counted their money and there a chunk missing"
Jed,and now he's back and already trying to start shit
Jed,just kick him from the discord then
Jed,if everyone agrees he is toxic
Jed,except not everyone does
Jed,and he's surprisingly good friends with one of our community leaders
Jed,and the guy who owns the discord
Jed,also I don't want to start shit with him
Jed,and there are even people who argue that the trash talk and stuff is good for the community
Jed,"""your popoff sucks"""
Jed,from the crowd
Jed,lololol
Jed,everyone hates dabuz for some reason
Jed,I love kingston sm4sh discord tho
Jed,"one guy (actually the melee zelda main) comments that, while he doesn't have a winning record against a lot of people, he couldn't think of anyone in the discord that he hasn't beaten"
Jed,then out of nowhere
Jed,"top player in ottawa shows up like ""yo what up?"" and has apparently been here for like half an hour just watching the conversation"
Jed,top tier lurking
Jed,what I want to see more than almost anything right now is fatality to 3-0 zack then give him the irl show me your moves
Jed,but I don't think he's that mean
Jed,let's gooooo fatality
Jed,that was crazy good
Jed,fatality's nuts
Jed,you almost got to see the fatality combo but T was juuuuust too low percent
Jed,that stomp footstool stomp footstool thing?
Jed,yes
Jed,so good
Jed,fatality in grands let's gooooooo
Jed,if he wins that would be so hype
Jed,he could do it
Jed,hard but doable
Jed,this guy makes smash 4 interesting to watch
Jed,these commentators are too loud
Jed,DMs ARE A THING
Jed,USE THEM
Jed,there used to be three of us watching
Jed,sorry
Jed,@here overwatch?
Jed,@Max almost done with tourney?
Jed,possibly
Jed,could be anywhere from one to seven more games
Jed,*one to eight
Jed,no one to seven
Jed,I have not finished my placements
Jed,I'm bad at math
Jed,can't play comp with you
Jed,booooo
Jed,fatality lost
Jed,it was so close but that early kill in the last game ate all his momentum
Jed,still crazy that he got 2nd
Jed,who won the whole thing?
Jed,dabuz
Jed,ah
Jed,"I am 57,358 of all faceit users"
Jed,"out of the 200,000 some that play"
Jed,VP just went 2-13 at half to overtime now
Jed,what map?
Jed,train
Jed,isn't train pretty one sided? didn't we do a similar thing the one time we played train?
Jed,eh it can be
Jed,where we got destroyed CT and then did pretty well on T?
Jed,but still
Jed,13-2
Jed,still impressive
Jed,both teams destroyed ct side though
Jed,shrugs

Jed,Competitive overwatch: episode 1
Jed,so apparently back in the '90s my university's student government had a 3-hour debate on whether or not to approve a campus Star Trek club because their constitution had a policy banning Klingons from being club members which the student government thought failed to promote equality
Jed,wat
Jed,http://kingstonherald.com/news/klingon-equity-queens-university-2010310319
Jed,"Klingon ""Equity"" Cited in Free Speech Grade for Queen's Universi..."
Jed,"AMS ""Student Union actions & practices"" gets a B in national report"
Jed,and yes that is a picture of a klingon photoshopped onto a picture of part of our campus
Jed,@Sak von Sak Thats super dumb
Jed,who cares
Jed,that's a good question
Jed,really funny tho
Jed,yeah
Jed,also proof that it's not just millenials who do weird things in the name of equality
Jed,in your country it started much earlier
Jed,oh don't give me that
Jed,I'm sure if you dug around the states you'd find stuff
Jed,yes
Jed,but you guys have been more progressive from farther back in time
Jed,"yeah, but I don't really qualify this as ""progressive"""
Jed,"more as ""slightly insane"""
Jed,its progressivism taken too far
Jed,although from the article I gather the issue was more about that other actually exclusive clubs could crop up using this as a precedent
Jed,oh that makes sense
Jed,"I mean I feel like it'd be pretty easy to make an argument against that working (""banning a fictional group is very different than banning an actual one, doesn't count as a precedent"") but at this level stuff like this has some legal standing so I can understand the caution and not wanting to have to have that argument"
Jed,My mic wasn't working
Jed,I'm pretty sure sm4sh wario mains have some of the best tags around
Jed,when I was in quebec over the summer there was a guy whose tag was WAHrrior and apparently there's some guy whose tag is EnigWAH
Jed,r/place has ended ;-;
Jed,"so I had this bright idea that cause I'm feeling pretty stressed I'm gonna work while listening to the upbeat/relaxing chunks of the chrono cross ost, and now I'm stuck cause I really just want to go play chrono cross and if there's one thing I really don't have time for it's a ~60 hour rpg"

Jed,it's actually not as bad as I'm making it sound
Jed,I just got called the king of organic chemistry by my teacher
Jed,my part of the term project is done and the course with the assignment I'm donig well enough that I can just not do this assignment and focus on the test (which is worth a much larger chunk of my mark for that course)
Jed,"and then I just have two more assignments, a test, and exams (one of which I'm horribly behind in the class and I'm gonna have to go in for a ton of help, but I've got time)"

Jed,@Bitmin
Jed,Anyone wanna play RoA?

Jed,@Bitmin can you log into bnet caz i cant
Jed,yup
Jed,New update and I'm stuck on vacation FEELSGREATMAN
Jed,oh no the horror of being stuck in california on vacation
Jed,I feel so bad for you
Jed,Thanks me too
Jed,it's the first week since november that we've had decent weather and I'm too busy to go out and enjoy it
Jed,glances outside oh hey it's started raining maybe being in here's not so bad
Jed,@here how's the new update?
Jed,its too cool for you
Jed,I'm too cool for this update
Jed,its pretty lit
Jed,the uprising event takes a while tho
Jed,I'm so bummed out rn
Jed,don't be
Jed,like its just a few cool skins
Jed,and new lore stuff
Jed,I don't like going on vacation
Jed,^
Jed,like just over a 100 pieces of new content
Jed,it's boring
Jed,honestly
Jed,Vacations are exhausting
Jed,vacations are supposed to be relaxing are u ok
Jed,Home is relaxing
Jed,@Mr. Airplane games are relaxing
Jed,@bois
Jed,@Max
Jed,lets play the new update
Jed,@Feral Nebula
Jed,"@Mr. Airplane I started learning C#, very interesting!!!"
Jed,if you want to play join a channel
Jed,@Trapezoider
Jed,I don't know C# at all @Trapezoider
Jed,@Mr. Airplane Rip dweeb
Jed,wait where did everyone go
Jed,@Zain
Jed,What is everyone doing in here? @here
Jed,nothing really
Jed,just playing the new update
Jed,Am sad
Jed,yuuuuus my linalg prof is so good
Jed,he just put up what every single question on the exam is going to be (not the specific numbers and graphs but what they're gonna be)
Jed,this is so helpful
Jed,linalg?
Jed,Good guy professor
Jed,linear algebra
Jed,super neat math stuff
Jed,Today Ava and trap are going to play a best of 5 rivals set to see who is better
Jed,ooh ooh tell me before it happens I want to watch
Jed,Gg
Jed,alright
Jed,I swear the math profs at queens are all so good
Jed,"best profs I've had these two years have been differential+integral calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math (only in second year, first year discrete math the prof was pretty bad)"
Jed,so math profs are pretty good then I guess
Jed,it's a pretty well funded department cause it overlaps with so many other ones so I assume they can afford really good ones
Jed,"but they're all really good at explaining stuff, have tons of office hours if you need to go in for help, do extra help stuff for tests and exams, have really comprehensive online resources, etc etc etc"
Jed,and as good as it is I kinda wish the prof quality was spread a little more evenly cause some profs suuuuuuck
Jed,possibly the most frustrating is this one guy who's a top guy in his field (his field is pretty specific) but he just can't teach it for shit
Jed,sad
Jed,If anyone was wondering
Jed,
Jed,ABSA IS BAD !?
Jed,Every character is close I just think absa is the worst
Jed,still totally viable
Jed,loud crying
Jed,just my opinion
Jed,others may say different
Jed,me being wrastor may influence that
Jed,YEAH YA THINK?
Jed,also we need to do the maypul vs orcane cuteness poll

Jed,but
Jed,its bowling
Jed,"XD If you have fun with it, get good and be the best"
Jed,"Welp I opened the door to my bathroom and a fucking two and a half inch long centipede comes zooming out, I actually almost pissed myself and may have woken up all my housemates"
Jed,Also I have an exam in five and a half hours and I'm wide awake
Jed,
Jed,So apparently the song I analyzed was anti war but I wrote the analysis being pro war cause that's what I thought it was 
Jed,Oops
Jed,Anything can mean anything if you say it loud enough
Jed,Truw
Jed,FREEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOM

Jed,that sucks
Jed,sadbois
Jed,  
Jed,@Sak von Sak I learned a shadow combo
Jed,nice nice
Jed,need to make sure I can do it both ways now
Jed,as in both directions
Jed,yeah that's always important
Jed,Good I can
Jed,Fight?
Jed,working on packing and cleaning right now
Jed,maybe later tonight
Jed,okay
Jed,Random question
Jed,http://www.strawpoll.me/12830647
Jed,Which would you rather have control the world?
Jed,Vote Now! [Nazi Germany] [Communist USSR] 
Jed,"I mean, seeing as I'm jewish this is a pretty easy question"
Jed,I'm assuming that very few of us are jews but for you yes its a no brainer
Jed,@Mr. Airplane @waowder wanna do some lockeed practice at around 8:30ish
Jed,@Rotomotorz  im down
Jed,sure
Jed,@waowder
Jed,yo
Jed,http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Codequest+2016+problems
Jed,LMGTFY
Jed,"so I'm skimming parts of the xenoblade x soundtrack, there is a song that is actually just called ""z37b20a13t01t08le"""
Jed,What???
Jed,I HAVE NO IDEA
Jed,by the way new sg character should be fully practiced and ready in a few days
Jed,nice nice
Jed,you're probably gonna surpass me soon
Jed,nah
Jed,I don't have any characters that are actually good other than double
Jed,I thought ms fortune was a good character
Jed,I'm not good with her tho
Jed,oh I see
Jed,also airdash cancling is super easy
Jed,grumbles
Jed,you made it sound impossible
Jed,I don't have the fast hands for it
Jed,you just input a ground dash
Jed,or I'm just doing something wrong mentally
Jed,in the air
Jed,tap foward twice
Jed,then do a move
Jed,yes but I can never seem to do it fast enough for the combo to keep going
Jed,"maybe it's a tighter window on fortune than whoever you're learning (if it's not fortune I'd assume filia, but if it's fortune then I just don't have the hands for it)"
Jed,maybe
Jed,I'll have to try whatever combo your doing and see
Jed,"I'm probably gonna drop fortune, focus on the parasoul (sure her combo's hard but I think with a bit more practice I'll be able to get it) plus I'm way more comfortable with her neutral and openers"
Jed,I do not like fighting characters that outrange me by a significant degree
Jed,this is why I need big band
Jed,she's basically marth with samus missiles
Jed,it's great
Jed,so dumb
Jed,I did a thing
Jed,
Jed,I am a totally different person without hair and it's kind of scary
Jed,So did i
Jed,lol what is that?
Jed,Getting stitches soon
Jed,No games 4 me
Jed,ouch
Jed,Yup
Jed,wait what happened @Jed
Jed,Was working on a model rocket and xacto knife slipped
Jed,I cut pretty deep
Jed,It was a new blade though so that's nice
Jed,yay for not getting tetanus
Jed,although an old one might not have cut as deep
Jed,Yeah
Jed,rip octagon
Jed,also wow I never knew what Sylki looked like
Jed,Yeet
Jed,"Most of my pc parts have been delivered, I'm just waiting on my case and operating system"
Jed,"In case anyone was wondering/cared, which, no-one does..."
Jed,why u throwing urself a pity party there
Jed,@Mr. Airplane
Jed,Are you prepared to build it
Jed,The first one is always scary D:
Jed,DONT WORK  ON CARPET DO IT ON A COUNTER
Jed,MAKE SURE TO TOUCH THE CASE A LOT TO AVOID STATIC FRYING TF OUT OF YOUR MOTHER BOARD
Jed,just use a static grounding glove its not that bad
Jed,But thats an extra thing to buy and is annoying
Jed,Not really?
Jed,subjective.org

Jed,Nice job kameron
Jed,zz
Jed,good luck with the PC at least you were gone during my finals week
Jed,quick what game are you playin rn

Jed,this is simulator simulator
Jed,renamed it

Jed,Kameron is forced to study for his exams in Junior year how about that
Jed,its as if Kameron was blessed by the gods

Jed,this is most certianly false
Jed,lies
Jed,this should.... probably be in the memes channel
Jed,you think this is a meme?
Jed,the probably is there because I'm not sure I wanted to read that regardless of where it was
Jed,triggered
Jed,LOL
Jed,is Sylki offended
Jed,less by the content than the style and the intentional amount of cringe
Jed,he tried to take credit for writing that
Jed,I did?
Jed,no trap
Jed,I suck at green texts @Sak von Sak
Jed,The only one I tried to write go no comments on 4 chan
Jed,:[
Jed,you poor soul
Jed,Green texts = favorite memes though

Jed,who made this server and can I please become  a master meme
Jed,memer
Jed,no
Jed,why dad
Jed,kys
Jed,it's fusion's server I think
Jed,aye
Jed,alright cool
Jed,I thought it was chikons
Jed,But then I realized he doesnt have the highest tier role
Jed,I think old frostbite was
Jed,also I'm pretty sure he's a master memer too
Jed,:[
Jed,also why do you want to be a master memer? what would you do with this untold power?
Jed,Nothing I just want to be up there with you guys
Jed,:[
Jed,the only thing I've used it for is to add the  emote
Jed,I would add a meme emote? and monitor the memes channel to ensure safety of users
Jed,what meme would you use to encapsulate the entirety of meme-hood?
Jed,Holy shit
Jed,P.E.P.E
Jed,actually
Jed,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CekwfI7VL._SX300_QL70_.jpg

Jed,Praise his name forever on high
Jed,This is lord kek
Jed,THe mightiest of all memes
Jed,He only appears one in every 69^(infinity) memes
Jed,I'll reserve judgement and leave it up to fusion
Jed,@Zain
Jed,I am the highest tier memer here
Jed,"also I'm considering changing my tag for smash at least, should I go to Young Irish Stew or Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer?"
Jed,Can I have a role that shows up above master memers that has no powers but says master master memers
Jed,Y O U N G I R I S H S T E W
Jed,! ! !
Jed,@everyone I want an opinion
Jed,I like Young Irish Stew
Jed,Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer is a mouthful
Jed,^
Jed,Yung without an o
Jed,just for the meme
Jed,"if I do it like that I'd have to shorten every word a bit, I can't thing of a good way to shorten Irish and Stu will make people think that that's my name"
Jed,I guess I could do Yung Irish Stoo
Jed,but I don't think it's as good
Jed,The other name is longer though
Jed,How would you shorten it?
Jed,probably just to Lermon Squerzer
Jed,and the shortening of this one was to have consistency with Yung instead of Young
Jed,@Mr. Airplane are you done building your comp

Jed,"no dungeons, supid quest system, terrible story, no cool items, and way too much just wandering around trying to find your next objective"
Jed,I think they focused on the open world part way too much
Jed,YES
Jed,and there's a lot of random grinding for no reason
Jed,I hate the fact that it is non linear
Jed,it makes it hard to tell a good story and properly scale difficulty
Jed,I keep running into enemies that kill me in one hit
Jed,why
Jed,git gud solved yo problem
Jed,did you know that your opinion of open world games is negative does not mean the game is objectively bad
Jed,^
Jed,@Sak von Sak chill avec moi
Jed,Young Irish Stew is typing...
Jed,"For example, what you just described is part of what I like about xenoblade x - they tell you right out the gates that the world is incredibly hostile and you're constantly hearing about people getting attacked and killed by super strong monsters and then it happens to you and you're kinda like ""damn.  Fortunately unlike these sucker npcs I can revive at checkpoints"" and it adds to all the world building"
Jed,"Also I can't right now, maybe later tonight"

Jed,Gyazo

Jed,what
Jed,I need this next year
Jed,I don't remember exactly how it works but if you make an amazon account with a student email you can get free prime
Jed,OP
Jed,within canada at least
Jed,so if any of you non-uni kids in canada want to order stuff off amazon you can probably do it through me (although paying me back would be complicated)
Jed,"oh also of note, that free shipping is free ONE-DAY SHIPPING"
Jed,woah
Jed,Yeah just make an account with your student email
Jed,free for a whole year
Jed,pretty sure I've had it more than a year
Jed,really? mine ran out after a year

Jed,@Bitmin
Jed,"toronto weather has gone from ""comfortably cool in jeans and a sweatshirt"" to ""sweating in shorts and a tshirt"" overnight"
Jed,No kidding
Jed,I was dying yesterday
Jed,I was kinda hoping it'd be a one day thing but it seems like it's sticking around
Jed,I feel no sympathy it's hot here all the time
Jed,it's not so bad when you're used to it
Jed,if it was this hot during the summer we wouldn't be complaining
Jed,but it jumped twenty degrees celsius overnight and that's bullshit
Jed,Around here this is basically considered part of summer
Jed,We get summer weather from May to October
Jed,"in fahrenheit, it went from 50 to 86 overnight"
Jed,that's not ok
Jed,86 is comforable
Jed,I wish I had heat
Jed,Comfortable*
Jed,"86 is slightly too hot, but when you're not used to it it's brutal"
Jed,also it's super humid
Jed,Ideal to me is 78
Jed,What humidity number is it?
Jed,69%
Jed,It's even worse when your AC isn't on
Jed,ahahaha our AC's semi busted so it doesn't get everywhere in the house
Jed,Okay I feel sorry for you guys now no ac is rough
Jed,Rip
Jed,fans have become a crucial commodity
Jed,I'm so tired
Jed,I fell asleep at like 3 last night
Jed,So I drank a monster and i was good for a whilr
Jed,But now I am tired again
Jed,I'd say my perfect temperatures are 22 (72ish) or 13 (55ish) depending on what I'm doing
Jed,also ouch
Jed,just force yourself to stay up as long as you can
Jed,Monsters are death in a bottle I would advise against drinking them
Jed,Nah
Jed,eh energy drinks are only bad if you drink like 5
Jed,I mean I don't drink them every day
Jed,admittadly I've never had energy drinks but so long as you don't go crazy with how many you drink and develop a dependancy you're fine
Jed,same with coffee
Jed,I know someone who drinks an energy drink every day and he just went to the dentist and apparently he has a cavity in every tooth
Jed,"when my mum was in college she also worked a night shift, and they had a coffee machine with free coffee and one day she realized that she couldn't function without 13 cups of coffee"
Jed,If I have lot of work to do sometimes I will get a drink with 6 shots of espresso 
Jed,Little bit Overkill but it does the job
Jed,I can stay up super late and focus with no assistance from coffee or monsters
Jed,You also don't go to school
Jed,Being social take a lot of energy
Jed,"Patch Notes For 1.3
Time Counters- Name changed to charge counters.
Knight- Added to the game and ability changed from drawing cards upon killing a creature or hitting a player to paying 2 to draw a card.
Spirit- Removed from the game.
Anti-Mage, Spearman, Grand Arbiter, Stasis Chamber, Sage, Guardian, Blacksmith, Zombie, Sword, The Power of Time, Archives, Thundersurge, Dig, Poke, Silence, Foundry, and Forbid- Added to the game."
Jed,The biggest MCG update yet
Jed,2 new pages of cards
Jed,"I can focus late without caffeine or energy drinks, but not for more than two, maybe three days in a row"
Jed,also Octagon feeling the introvert struggle
Jed,I feel your pain
Jed,I'm not even an introvert
Jed,It's just that being social is a lot of work
Jed,that's the actual definition of introverted
Jed,you can be a super social introvert
Jed,it just takes a ton of your energy
Jed,wanna play games?
Jed,@here
Jed,maybe later tonight
Jed,@everyone Looking for beta testers for MCG 1.3 on tabletop simulator!

Jed,@chikon
Jed,@Mr. Airplane
Jed,Can I get help with one permutations problem
Jed,@everyone
Jed,In how many orders can four students be lined up against a wall if there are six to choose from
Jed,that makes no sense
Jed,I think 6P4
Jed,360?
Jed,it's been awhile since I did permutations and combinations
Jed,im so confused fml
Jed,I think its 360
Jed,"l;'kadfs;'klafds'lk;fkasd;'lk;l'afdsl;'kkl;'fadslk;'dfaskl;'rewqoip[reqwio[preqwio[prqewio[preqw[iopreqwio[pvcxzm,./cvxzmn.,cvzxnm,.zcvxnm.,zvc"
Jed,if I remember correctly it's 6P4
Jed,if that's an option on your calculator
Jed,thats the equation for permuations taken at a time
Jed,there should be an nPr thing
Jed,tell me if it ends up at 360
Jed,I don't think it's going to
Jed,it doesn't matter that they're taken all at once
Jed,it'd be the same thing if you picked one at a time
Jed,I'm 95% sure it's just 6P4
Jed,"(which actually is 360, either max is a god or he just plugged it in)"
Jed,I did not use a calculator
Jed,I did it in my head
Jed,actually not true
Jed,but I didn't use a P function
Jed,I'm gonna assume you know the full formula for it tho?
Jed,its 6x5x4x3
Jed,easy
Jed,suddenly realizes I've been using the overcomplicated version for if you have repeated elements
Jed,goddamn it higher education for making me forget about simple solutions to stuff
Jed,lol
Jed,figured out why my ping was bad
Jed,I have 2 exchange students staying at my house
Jed,and they are both simultaneously using their phones and laptops
Jed,gg
Jed,rip
Jed,dumb chinese people
Jed,jk
Jed,Does anyone here think its normal to call your friends by their last name?
Jed,I think first name is more friendly so yeah last name is a little wierd
Jed,why?
Jed,someone is trying to convince me it is normal but nAH
Jed,I want opinions of people who arent homeschool though
Jed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gia6en2R0Q&feature=youtu.be I heard you guys like sick tracer highlights
Jed,sick tracer highlight
Jed,we still lost that push and the game :)
Jed,we still lost that push though and the game 
Jed,It is normal in some culture
Jed,And I'm sure if ur name is something hard to say like Uvuvwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwembubwem Ossas then people would probably call you by urn last name
Jed,Some of my friends call me by my last name occasionally
Jed,@Feral Nebula it can be used kinda like a nickname
Jed,Like you don't always call the by their last name
Jed,But sometimes
Jed,I think we need a wall between China and the us
Jed,it very much depends on the person
Jed,"it's rare, but some people prefer last name or middle name to first name"
Jed,there was a guy at my elementary school who everyone called Mac and I didn't learn until grade 4 that that wasn't his actual name
Jed,Our school have a guy we call max but that isn't his realy name
Jed,also a lot of asian kids have a legal name and a given name and would much prefer if you used the given one
Jed,"for example, I have a friend whose actual name is Xenswe, but we all just call him Ben"
Jed,(might be a bit off on the spelling it's been awhile since I've actually seen it)
Jed,It happens a lot in sports too. Probably because your last name is what's on all of your stuff
Jed,also in sports some people's last names are just so clearly better than their first names
Jed,like Stan Warinka
Jed,@waowder csgo?
Jed,Aren't you in school
Jed,no
Jed,we had a test today
Jed,@Jed
Jed,play with us too
Jed,I'm sorta in school though
Jed,What is up my dudes
Jed,Does anyone here find shoulders to be sexy or distracting
Jed,no
Jed,lol no
Jed,literally no one does
Jed,my high school was HILARIOUS(ly dumb) about it tho
Jed,"Can't wear: Shirt that exposes your shoulders or stomach
Can wear: Shirt that exposes a solid 50% of your boobs"
Jed,"I mean if you're gonna bring up the whole distraction thing, boobs are clearly way more distracting than shoulders"
Jed,They tried to send me home
Jed,"but even then, NO ONE IS ACTUALLY IGNORING CLASS TO STARE AT PEOPLE"
Jed,Wait they tried to send you home because you were exposing your shoulders?
Jed,wait they tried to send YOU home for exposing your shoulders?
Jed,Yes
Jed,your a dude
Jed,WAIT WHAT
Jed,why
Jed,hahahaha
Jed,Yup
Jed,that's amazing
Jed,thats so dumb
Jed,your school is a trainwreck
Jed,like are you just wearing a tank top?
Jed,Apparently 2 teachers told the office person that I was wearing a tank top
Jed,Like come on don't be a little bitch just dress code me yourself
Jed,Sorry I am a little heated
Jed,I mean I totally would be to
Jed,dress code is dumb enough already
Jed,the shoulders thing is even dumber
Jed,but I've literally never heard of a GUY getting dresscoded for shoulders
Jed,"""oh no his sculpted physique is distracting the class"""
Jed,wait octagon showed his shoulders in school what a slut
Jed,Ha
Jed,I know I'm a whore
Jed,But get this
Jed,Girls are allowed to wear tank tops
Jed,you should have told them it's within your rights to embrace your physical attractiveness
Jed,WAIT WHAT
Jed,Yup
Jed,why is your school so dumb
Jed,Do you understand my frustration now
Jed,thats so wierd
Jed,I mean I understood it before
Jed,but it just keeps getting worse
Jed,WHAT IS YOUR SCHOOL

Jed,Who knows
Jed,"in general, I would say either have no dress code whatsoever or do uniforms, don't half-ass it"
Jed,"and yeah, uniforms kinda suck but there are arguments to be made for it, and most places would just not have a dress code"
Jed,but god damn your school actually sounds like it has the worst implemented dress code I've ever heard of
Jed,Yes it also is dependent on if the office people like you or not

Jed,if you want a good team at least

Jed,congrats u can read
Jed,proud
Jed,@Bitmin
Jed,picking my degree tomorrow and super stressed about making the wrong choice
Jed,@The Rona what degree are you going to go for?
Jed,Some type of science
Jed,I was thinking of doing science but given my current interests and skill set I think I might do business
Jed,I basically get to design my courses for the first year or so before picking what I want
Jed,cool
Jed,You have to pick something that you're going to enjoy doing in the future
Jed,So keep that in mind I guess
Jed,That was the main reason I decided I probably shouldn't do a science job because I don't really enjoy doing math and I don't want that to be my job
Jed,What type of business do you want?
Jed,business management I think
Jed,don't have to decide the specific type until year 3
Jed,That's pretty cool
Jed,but the general look of the course seems like something I would enjoy and be good at more than the engineering degrees I was looking at before
Jed,Mine is the same
Jed,It is the same in that the specific doesn't come until year 3?
Jed,"Yeah, I have until year 3 to declare a major"
Jed,But I can do it whenever
Jed,Anniversary event
Jed,new sym skin bois

Jed,and the other team isn't letting me play cause I have silver experience from two years ago
Jed,"welp I just rang for a team, and I knew they sucked, but damn they just kicked their roamer cause he didn't know how to rocket jump"

Jed,why does it cost so much to attend GOML?
Jed,venue fee mostly
Jed,wow thats a big venue fee
Jed,"$45 for three days of venue fee, twenty dollars for two events, tax"
Jed,the venue fee at TGC the biggest tournament I ever went to was like $5
Jed,"it's pretty rare to see more than 5-10, but I'm not surprised it's more for a major"
Jed,"they have to cover the venue somehow, and I'm sure booking somewhere this big for a whole weekend isn't cheap"
Jed,Done with finals and got a 100% on my last one
Jed,noice noice

Jed,@everyone Question 6 is up
Jed,Who is the person who answered ambidextrous?
Jed,"@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Any opinions before I officially change the cards?            Patch Notes For 1.4 
Necromancer- Cost reduced from 4>3. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 1 creature at night was removed. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 2 creatures was restricted to night time only. 
Poison Pump- Name changed to Catapult.
Soldier- HP decreased from 4>2
Barbarian- HP decreased from 2>1
Tribesman- Attack decreased from 2>1
Field Medic- Attack increased from 0>2
Break- Added effect “If this card is countered shuffle it into your deck instead of discarding it.”
Counterspell- You now lose 3 life if you play counterspell by sending a card to the void.
 Extract- The player who played extract now chooses which card gets discarded.
Banish- Added effect “You may not have more than 2 banishes in play at a time”.
Knight- HP increased from 3>4.
Spearman- HP increased from 3>4 Attack decreased from 2>1 Damage dealt by ability increased from 3>4.
Stasis Chamber- HP increased from 2>3
Sage- Cost increased from 1>2 Ability changed to “When Sage destroys a creature or damages a player you may add a spell or instant costing 2 or less to your hand”. Rather than playing the card for free and shuffling it back into your deck.
Zombie- HP increased from 1>2 Attack decreased from 3>2. Now only resurrects if you pay 1 resource.
Thundersurge- HP of creatures killed decreased from 3>1 cost decreased from 3>2.
Dig- HP gained by opponent decreased from 2>1.
Sword- Attack gained by equipped creature increased from 3>4."
Jed,I was fond of old necromancer but I think that's why he's getting nerfed
Jed,old necromancer was OP
Jed,"I don't think soldier was all that good, maybe do 4->3 instead, cause otherwise he's almost too squishy (and you've not got that many cards with more than two hp)"
Jed,18/27 of my creatures have more than 2 HP
Jed,"one necromancer tweak I think would be interesting would be something like you have to sacrifice creatures such that the total health of your sacrificed stuff equals the number of resources you'd need to summon the thing you're bringing back, and maybe half that during the night, cause I liked that aspect of him"
Jed,join voice if you can
Jed,so basically you can drop a creature with only two health left to summon one that would require 2 resource to summon
Jed,I can't
Jed,there are two reasons I didn't do that
Jed,also I don't think barb/tribesman were OP
Jed,1 is there isn't enough room on the card to describe such an effect
Jed,2 is that creatures with high attack on low HP would be to good with it
Jed,how so?
Jed,"you're not doing health -> health, you're doing health -> effective resources"
Jed,oh in that case wall would make that super OP
Jed,true
Jed,didn't think of that
Jed,I think the counterspell nerf is unecessary
Jed,me neither
Jed,also I haven't played with or against a bunch of the cards you're tweaking so I'll leave those up to you
Jed,I'm considering how to make necromancer more interesting in the future but for now I just wanted him to not be OP so we can use him
Jed,he is one of the more unique cards
Jed,also I vote changing the name of poison pump to swarm
Jed,ooh I like that
Jed,thats good
Jed,I'll use that
Jed,cool-cool my work here is done
Jed,I think I'm going to reduce the nerf to soldier and counterspell
Jed,I like the extract change
Jed,but doesn't it mean that you see the other person's hand? or you just pick randomly?
Jed,New changes Soldier- HP reduced from 4>3 Counterspell- Lose 2 HP instead of 3 as I plannned before
Jed,you see the other persons hand
Jed,I feel like that makes it really good then
Jed,not as good as before
Jed,it used to be unquestionably the best card in the game
Jed,and it controlled the meta
Jed,then I nerfed it so hard that no one has really used it since
Jed,I'm trying something new in the hopes that extract will become a good but not OP card
Jed,getting ready for that extract banish combos tho
Jed,oh I didn't think of that
Jed,now I'm glad I nerfed banish a little
Jed,rip my cool ideas
Jed,having half of your deck be dead is an unwinnable position
Jed,also your idea still works
Jed,"yeah, if you can get both in your starting hand that is really good"
Jed,Patch 1.5 might include new cards. If so you guys can recommend some ideas for them.
Jed,time to start working on my storm cycle deck which I will of course be calling storm warning
Jed,lol
Jed,@Rotomotorz league
Jed,dude... wall + sword = op?
Jed,maybe
Jed,wall fury was a deck in the original version of my game
Jed,nice
Jed,Also I forget a patch note
Jed,Archives- Added effect “You may not use this ability on cards that can be recasted”
Jed,MCG V1.4 is now live!
Jed,@Mr. Airplane I made a storm warning deck
Jed,but I was gonna do that tho
Jed,you can also do one
Jed,k
Jed,I just wanted to see the different designes we could come up with
Jed,"did you use like scout, dig, visions, wall and stuff"
Jed,some but not all of those
Jed,cool-cool
Jed,My deck can be reduced to I think 4 cards
Jed,all others banished
Jed,although that may not be necessary
Jed,nice dude
Jed,we can test it later
Jed,"as in like, a different day, I'm bouta go to sleep"
Jed,Cool card idea: Watch 3 (Equipment)- Target creature exists in its own time which can be chosen and changed at any time by whoever controls the Watch.
Jed,I like it
Jed,@everyone Question 7 is up! This one was suggested by aeiou.

Jed,"for my brother's uni graduation, he realized twenty minutes before leaving that he didn't own black socks, so he stole a pair of mine and then lost one in a lake"
Jed,LOL
Jed,rip sock
Jed,Who wears socks in a lake

Jed,@waowder quickplay?
Jed,TooLegend#11911
Jed,can confirm - fewer things are worse than going through someone else's poorly commented css and trying to figure out what everything does
Jed,saem
Jed,css?
Jed,"stands for cascading style sheet, it's basically what manages colours and fonts and a million other little things on webpages"
Jed,"in general, html says what goes where, css says how it looks"
Jed,and I'm digging through someone else's css and trying mostly by trial and error to figure out what affects what
Jed,and it's brutal
Jed,@Bitmin want to play overwatch in like 30 minutes?

Jed,"also an unrelated question for all you americans, do ketchup chips actually not exist in the states?"
Jed,i have no idea what a ketchup chip is
Jed,nah i'm pretty sure ketchup chips are just a canada thing
Jed,I don't even like ketchup chips but I cannot imagine them not existing
Jed,like
Jed,"literally any time anyone is getting chips for a party or something, you can't NOT bring ketchup chips cause someone there is going to love them"
Jed,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Jed,17 quadrillian degrees dude
Jed,Is it a ketchup flavored chip?
Jed,nah it's chip flavored ketchup
Jed,yeah there's like a ketchup powder thing on it
Jed,that feel when you remember bitmins name used to be bitshock
Jed,WHAT
Jed,I THOUGHT THOSE WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
Jed,well it took the temperature going up to 34 for my family to turn on the AC but at this point I'm just glad it's on
Jed,(also for you americans that's like 93 fahrenheit)
Jed,It's supposed to get that hot in a few days where I am
Jed,And I'm excited
Jed,I love hot weather
Jed,this is too hot for anything other than going to the beach
Jed,ideal temperature is 15-22
Jed,(basically 60-70)
Jed,I prefer between 70-80
Jed,that's probably the second best range
Jed,"also -10 to 0 is pretty nice for winter stuff, cause there's still snow but it's not actually all that cold"
Jed,We rarely get snow FeelsBadMan
Jed,Though we did this year and schools were closed multiple days for like 3 inches
Jed,lololol if canadian schools closed for three inches we'd be off from like mid december till mid march
Jed,with a few weirdly warm days in the middle
Jed,@Jed I'm at a lake so we can use our boat
Jed,"USA and  Canada World Cup teams will be revealed this Thursday at E3 at 5 PM PST, will play against each other in showmatch"

Jed,I was driving through LA yesterday
Jed,And I realized 2 things
Jed,1. Driving in big cities sucks balls
Jed,2. E3 is happening in LA this week
Jed,@Mr. Airplane meme with me
Jed,no
Jed,pls
Jed,no
Jed,y
Jed,how could you
Jed,ur not a tur fren
Jed,tru*
Jed,not on computer
Jed,So???
Jed,I'm sulking
Jed,meme on phone then
Jed,too busy sulking
Jed,lameo
Jed,"He got dumped ok, let him sulk in peace"
Jed,can't spell kameron without name
Jed,cuz his name is trah lmao gg
Jed,i cry
Jed,and also sulk
Jed,that too
Jed,shulk?
Jed,monando
Jed,no
Jed,nintendo's presentation kinda sucked btw
Jed,did we get anything on xenoblade 2?
Jed,ye
Jed,some anime trailers
Jed,no gameplay really
Jed,E3 was pretty lacking this year
Jed,agreed
Jed,suddenly remembers that a) I don't have a switch and b) they're like $600 and c) I don't have $600 to spend on a switch
Jed,nothing was really stand out in any of the presentations
Jed,My friend just got one today
Jed,He went to ebgames during lunch and they had 3 in stock
Jed,naisu
Jed,still not worth tho
Jed,no games
Jed,also he should sell it and profit
Jed,And it was only ~$550 including Zelda
Jed,kameron they have a 40 minute xenoblade gameplay video
Jed,that is a lot of gameplay
Jed,that's not the presentation bruh
Jed,and goddamn it they kept the main character's hella dumb design
Jed,ye
Jed,the game is honestly pretty ugly
Jed,man is wearing hollow harem pants with short shorts under them
Jed,why
Jed,also yeah it doesn't look great
Jed,like ps2.5 graphics
Jed,literally looks worse than x
Jed,which has the terrifying uncanny valley people
Jed,"looks almost as bad as the original, but they don't really compensate with cool looking stuff"
Jed,"but the environments just aren't great in this one, and sure the stylization for the characters means they don't look bad graphically, but they just look awful aesthetically"
Jed,ye
Jed,also the fuck is that girls bust
Jed,I'm 95% that's not how boobs work
Jed,what are you some kinda doctah?
Jed,remembers Fiora and Sharla and basically every female character other than Melia ok I guess that's always kinda been there
Jed,doctor ur supposed to respond because I mentioned medical professionals
Jed,starts watching the trailer THAT IS THE CHRONO TRIGGER OPENING YOU JUST STOLE
Jed,after a brief double check it's the same composer so I guess it's fine
Jed,also HYPE it's the same composer as chrono trigger
Jed,I have not been super hyped for a game and then actually liked the game in such a long time
Jed,last game may have been rivals of aether
Jed,literally after looking at what they have to show the only thing I'm hyped for in xenoblade2 is the soundtrack
Jed,also the boat is still broken rip
Jed,seriously the world looks pretty awful and the character design is actually horrible
Jed,"I swear to god the previous games have so many good character designs (if occasionally poor implementation cause meh graphics), and then SERIOUSLY WHAT IS THIS SHIT https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/e/ee/Switch_XenobladeChronicles2_E32017_character_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20170613180929"
Jed,I left my computer ok man
Jed,DO YOU REALLY NEED ALL THOSE BELTS
Jed,no
Jed,Those belts aren't even holding anything
Jed,Except for the one around his waist
Jed,"and the main female character is made of fanservice - super skinny, giant boobs, basically no clothing, and shorts so short they barely even qualify as shorts"
Jed,thats just sad
Jed,I mean there's always been a bit of fanservice in this series but that's taking it up a few too many levels
Jed,they're basically at the level before kill la kill and THAT SHIT WAS A PARODY OF OVERDONE FANSERVICE
Jed,I'm ok witht eh guy design but the pyra girl whatever is a little much
Jed,"that also somehow managed to slip some actual good character designs in around the fanservice, which xenoblade 2 is very much not"
Jed,"I was kinda hoping they'd do something about the characters after the first trailer came out way back when and everyone kinda went ""wow those characters look terrible"" but nope"
Jed,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Jed,"on the plus side, unless they pull their shit together I no longer have a reason to drop $600 on a switch"
Jed,Splatoon 2?
Jed,Mario Odyssey?
Jed,Kirby Switch?
Jed,FE Switch?
Jed,can we talk about mario oddesssy for a second
Jed,Arms?
Jed,arms is bad
Jed,Metroid 4?
Jed,the free trial was 0 fun
Jed,and how fucking bizzare a cartoonish character looks in a moderately (or at least anatomically accurate) world?
Jed,But it doesnt even look that bad
Jed,I'm not sold on it
Jed,it's a pretty clashing visual style
Jed,"both can work well on their own, but together it's just weird"
Jed,it'd be like anime characters showing up in american cartoons
Jed,also why does nintendo keep making dynasty warriors style games
Jed,"sure hyrule warriors was kind of a cult classic but I feel like a lot of that was people following the LoZ train, and they're kinda boned doing it with series with smaller fanbases"
Jed,Fire Emblem has a respectable fanbase
Jed,"Fire Emblem, sure, but why are they making a Fate/ one? no one actually likes anything other than the animes and the vn"
Jed,they'll lose it if they only have awakening fates and marth so
Jed,"lol ""respectable fanbase"""
Jed,maybe if they added some of the other games
Jed,it'll probably still sell fine with just awakefates + marth
Jed,I mean they got a decently spread cast for heroes (sure it's pretty skewed but at least they got SOME from other games)
Jed,Lmao these Splat Tim memes are so good
Jed,huh?
Jed,In the splatoon tournament at E3
Jed,Tim is a us memeber who got like a 3v1 doubel
Jed,and now the chat memes whenever he does something
Jed,he's not even the best player on the US team but he's a good meme
Jed,(I know nothing about splatoon but that seems cool)
Jed,oh boy the US won
Jed,does this mean the US is finally good at an esport lmao
Jed,@Rotomotorz league
Jed,Actually
Jed,looking at Pyra she's not much worse than fiora
Jed,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Jed,no
Jed,kys
Jed,will do budy
Jed,am not your buddy pal
Jed,am not your pal buddy
Jed,your not my friend unfriended on bnet get fucked lil bitch
Jed,oh......
Jed,com'on man that was too far...
Jed,good god the final mission of xenoblade x is hard
Jed,I mean I might be like 5 levels lower than the boss I'm trying to fight but still
Jed,I keep knocking off most of his health and getting so damn close and then he kills me
Jed,"fuck you, fat man in a large mech"
Jed,"FUCK IT I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW A FEW LEVELS HIGHER AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHOSE BIRTHRIGHT IS PAIN, ASSHOLE"
Jed,lol someone is a little upset
Jed,bastard has so much health
Jed,and he keeps spawning stuff that has lots of health
Jed,and then he goes invincible AND REGENS HIS HEALTH
Jed,AND THEN SPAWNS MORE THINGS
Jed,wow that sounds terrible to play against
Jed,I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S THE FINAL BOSS I'M ONLY ON PART 3/5 OF THE MISSION
Jed,also it's actually a pretty fun fight
Jed,but I'm really feeling the AI handicap
Jed,I feel like if somehow I could have three additional humans handling my party members I could win this fight
Jed,Is that possible?
Jed,nope
Jed,but hey at least the ai's not as bad as in the original
Jed,and at least the music's hella badass
Jed,@Rotomotorz league?
Jed,sure hold up i'm patching
Jed,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch

Jed,congrats
Jed,also there was a twist where I had almost the right idea and I'm so mad
Jed,I almost predicted it
Jed,my logic was so almost but not quite correct
Jed,was it a good game?
Jed,yee
Jed,"definately have some issues with the game, but overall good"
Jed,(also I'm hella nitpicky so most of the issues are pretty minor)
Jed,Going to attend the MCG conference tomorrow?
Jed,probably yeah
Jed,can't wait to be back
Jed,also I swear they saved like all the best songs for the last little bit
Jed,pre-final boss - awesome music
Jed,final boss - awesome music
Jed,"cutscene in between the two of those, hella pretty"
Jed,credits theme - damn good
Jed,"most of the rest of the game - occasional scattered good songs here and there but the ones you hear a lot (normal battle theme, hub area, etc) kinda crappy"
Jed,aw really you're gonna end it on another twist and leave some stuff totally unexplained
Jed,dammit
Jed,you'd better make a fucking sequel
Jed,that looks better than xenoblade2
Jed,Still a good game

Jed,it's raining THAT hard
Jed,wow
Jed,work?? I thought school was out
Jed,"work, as in I have been hired to do a thing"
Jed,"although in this case ""hired"" is a loose term"
Jed,"basically a friend of my brother's is like ""yo make me a website and if it's good I'll pay you"""
Jed,and they also haven't emailed me back about a whole bunch of stuff for like two weeks -_-
Jed,rip thats pretty unprofessional of them
Jed,"I mean they have an actual full-time job and stuff, this is just for a side thing they're doing"
Jed,"""and if it's good I'll pay you"""

it went something like this: What do you call a blueberry that made a mistake while filming?
A blooperberry
why"
Jed,What is a smokers favorite kind of berry?
Jed,A rasp-berry
Jed,oh my god
Jed,I am the pun king
Jed,@Zain can I make a daily pun text channel?
Jed,sure
Jed,NICE
Jed,Oh I forgot to say last night about the Your Eternal Reward that your cloak drains 50% faster
Jed,@Max @Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak
Jed,wow that's awful
Jed,I mean no one used it anyway
Jed,but why encourage people to not use it even more
Jed,That's what I'm saying
Jed,I like how it is now
Jed,"It's supposed to be a fun gimmick, not a viable weapon"
Jed,@here ovahwatch???
Jed,@Bitmin @Zain
Jed,@Mr. Airplane level up that alt man
Jed,mmmmk
Jed,Rip computer
Jed,IM DECAYING :[
Jed,@Mr. Airplane @Zain 6 wins and 2 losses so far in my placements.
Jed,I think my mother board is dead
Jed,wow that sucks
Jed,didn't you just get a new computer
Jed,Well it isn't new
Jed,The motherboard was still stock
Jed,And had been used somewhat
Jed,@Bitmin 5 mins
Jed,oh shit I though the life is strange sale was $5 per chapter but it's $5 for the whole thing
Jed,I MUST GET IT
Jed,that is cheap
Jed,"Did you paly the demo, Quick?"
Jed,no
Jed,I still haven't finished the demo but I'm liking what I've seen so far (and yes I know that wasn't directed at me)
Jed,but 5 dollars for the whole thing is worth it
Jed,"it's on sale till the 5th, give the demo a shot first"
Jed,"Also by demo, it's actually the full first episode"
Jed,Also I got a Switch today!
Jed,
Jed,cool-cool
Jed,nice nice
Jed,SYLKI HOW DARE YOU STEAL MY SAYING AFFIRMATIVE WORDS TWICE THING
Jed,thats my thing
Jed,I SAY NICE NICE ALL THE TIME
Jed,THATS A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Jed,YOU'RE A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Jed,THATS NOT VERY NICE NICE TO SAY
Jed,also code geass is really good
Jed,yeeee
Jed,how far are you?
Jed,curently on episode 15
Jed,and the code geass binge continues
Jed,it's impossible to not binge your first time through
Jed,feelsbadman?
Jed,I watched the whole thing in four days
Jed,both seasons?
Jed,and the first 46 episodes in 3
Jed,yeah the whole thing
Jed,wait how many seasons are there?
Jed,just two right?
Jed,just the two
Jed,c2 is confusing
Jed,they're doing a third but there's a decent chance it's just a cash grab cause apparently the studio's not doing so well and it does seem odd that they'd suddenly rejuvinate the series like 9 years later
Jed,WOW CHIKON YOURE SUCH A WEEABOO
Jed,yur bad at overwatch
Jed,ok
Jed,at least I'm not a filthy weeb
Jed,OH WAIT XDDDD
Jed,yeah I was gonna say
Jed,you have an animoo profile picture
Jed,shhh
Jed,we dont talk about that
Jed,at least you're not like the closet weeb from kingston
Jed,"apparently, changing his tag to Kaneki ""wasn't a weeb thing or anything"""
Jed,LOL
Jed,"but at the moment his profile picture is Rem from re zero and that whole ""not a weeb thing"" is looking even less plausible than before"
Jed,he just needs to accept it
Jed,being a weeb is fun
Jed,hear hear
Jed,"(don't kill me kameron, hear hear is a thing that needs to go twice)"
Jed,lol
Jed,YOU SHALL BE PUBLICALLY EXECUTED SYLKI FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST MY IDIOSYNCRASIES
Jed,OBJECTION!
Jed,you can't make me
Jed,"also, @Mr. Airplane @The Rona @Rotomotorz you guys want to try starting the race over tonight?"
Jed,Maybe
Jed,If I'm not caught up playing Zelda :L
Jed,Maybe as well
Jed,"Look out for a Discord user by the name of ""Kazuto Kirigia "" with the tag #2169 .

Jed,@Zain
Jed,Can you review a vod for me later
Jed,Im uploading it to youtube and could really use some feedback on this particular loss 
Jed,sure
Jed,@Zain
Jed,"Thank you im uploading it now. I played mostly mcree, but threw in some stall heroes at the end"
Jed,
Jed,@everyone
Jed,so close to my season high
Jed,Oh wait this belongs in the memes channel
Jed,@everyone i lent trap my adblocker account and he won feelzgoodman
Jed,Feels good man
Jed,"don't know if anyone here still plays fe heroes but the voting thing is crazy close - they're apart by ~1.2 million points, which seems like a lot execpt that the scores are both almost thirty BILLION"
Jed,aka they differ by 0.012%
Jed,voting on what?
Jed,it's basically waifu wars
Jed,"(this time at least, normally it's not JUST girls)"
Jed,who are the two characters being voted on?
Jed,this time around it was basically who's the best healer character and it's ended up narrowed down to elise and priscilla
Jed,and given that I never used priscilla in fe7 I'm backing elise
Jed,we're down 1.2 million
Jed,So your supposed to vote on character strength?
Jed,naw just how much you like the character
Jed,So even if one is clearly better you could still vote for the other just because you like them better?
Jed,yeah
Jed,also all the healers kinda suck in this game
Jed,so you're not really voting for whoever's the strongest
Jed,and while you do get slightly better prizes if you win it's not really that significant
Jed,i am confirmed masters player

Jed,I remember when he died I had two thoughts. #1 Hooray a dangerous terrorist is dead. #2 Oh darn this will make Obama look good (I think the election was soon to occur).
Jed,is making Obama look good a bad thing?
Jed,I wanted him out
Jed,why?
Jed,because his political opinions didnt align with his
Jed,Too many reasons to explain in text but to put it simply I am a Republican and he is not so why wouldn't I want him out.
Jed,I mean being a Republican doesn't mean you have to dislike a Democratic nominee.
Jed,A nominee which I disagree with on 90%+ of issues is not going to have my support.
Jed,^^^
Jed,truth
Jed,Well what did you not agree with him on?
Jed,nearly everything
Jed,Remember the part where he said there was too much to explain over text
Jed,^^^
Jed,"also I wasn't trying to disprove your statement, just bringling light to the fact that the ""He's Democrat i'm Republican"" thing doesn't hold much weight on it's own"

Jed,I was trying to end this conversation.

Jed,time to spam andrew with voicemails
Jed,lol
Jed,do it
Jed,you won't
Jed,lol
Jed,already did it
Jed,I just had the dumbest shift of my life
Jed,shift was 300-530
Jed,"I get paid by the delivery, and no one orders food during that time period"
Jed,normally I'd get two or three deliveries for that
Jed,"I got one delivery, and I had to wait till 445"
Jed,wow that sucks
Jed,delivery fee - $7
Jed,tip - $21
Jed,I'll take it
Jed,"so basically I sat around for two hours, worked for twenty minutes, made almost $30"
Jed,sounds like a weird job
Jed,like not profitable very much
Jed,or am I wrong?
Jed,yeah it's super not profitable
Jed,"it pays well per hour, especially if you can get a dinner shift (530-830 is suuuuch a good shift to get), but there aren't many shifts"
Jed,seriously the 530-830 pays about $20 an hour

Jed,@Master Memers we should get more dude Bros in here
Jed,why though
Jed,IDK
Jed,Why does hyp keep getting kicked
Jed,He doesn't do anything wrong
Jed,because no one likes him
Jed,???
Jed,Mrd do you like hype
Jed,"To me, it seems like he doesn't care about us. Maybe? Dunno."
Jed,No he likes being in here. He really wants to be involved
Jed,that's too bad
Jed,Who keeps kicking him?
Jed,he is banned
Jed,Really?
Jed,yes
Jed,fusion was the one who kicked him the first time and trap invited him back
Jed,I honestly have no clue.
Jed,Why is he banned
Jed,What did he do
Jed,@Jed
Jed,I did have one experience where he just joins a channel other people are in and just leaves.
Jed,I do that
Jed,Maybe invite him back and ask him
Jed,"And if he gives a valid reason, ban him again, unless you hate him"
Jed,
Jed,Okay okay point taken!
Jed,it was agreed upon by many people to ban him
Jed,so it stands
Jed,I didn't hear about that so I didn't know.
Jed,Nah
Jed,That's not valid there wasn't a vote
Jed,When fusion gets back we're taking a vote
Jed,no
Jed,max is admin
Jed,Yes
Jed,For now
Jed,Then ask him
Jed,I will talk to Fusion about this when he gets back for now I will drop it
Jed,4 of the master memers agreed
Jed,fusion kicked him in the first place
Jed,4 out of 8
Jed,That's not even a majority
Jed,"(for the record I just kinda shrugged my shoulders and didn't vote, but I'm not against it, I can see why he rubs a lot of people the wrong way)"
Jed,and the others don't even know him
Jed,That doesn't include the other members
Jed,"also let's be fair, smithy and bitmin are hardly around, fusion's gone and left max in charge"
Jed,"All I'm saying is when fusion gets back, I'm going to ask to have this reconsidered"
Jed,"He's my friend, and I really like having him around"
Jed,That is all
Jed,/End
Jed,woah
Jed,private calls are a thing
Jed,who knew
Jed,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Jed,/End
Jed,"Who knew, weaponized autism is a thing that infects over 69 million 8 sided shapes a year"
Jed,༼ つ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ  that's where you're wrong kiddo
Jed,aight if this keeps devolving into throwing shit at each other I'm gonna have to request that you just do it in pms
Jed,when you lose control of a situation it automatically shoots to insults huh
Jed,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Jed,I'm done
Jed,also I realize I could have done a sick pun with pms and PMs but I wasted the opportunity
Jed,dang
Jed,"""If you guys are gonna go all PMS on each other I'd appreciate if you did it through PMs"""
Jed,boom
Jed,what a missed opportunity
Jed,rip
Jed,I'm not the one who started with a bad attitude about this. Also okay @Sak von Sak I'll move this so I don't end up bannerinod
Jed,"wasn't a threat, just a request so we don't clog the chat with you two having a discussion mostly meant for each other"

Jed,@Trapezoider
Jed,newt films?
Jed,one of the things I love about one of the webcomics I'm reading is that everyone who reads it has been conditioned to it being depressing so that any time something nice happens we all get really scared
Jed,even though nothing particularly bad has happened for like five chapters (of seven)
Jed,but you can't just kill off half the cast two chapters in and not expect people to be constantly nervous
Jed,@Jed thank you yes
Jed,yeah boi

Jed,I need to create a new Facebook
Jed,yeah

Jed,@Jed
Jed,The feeling when you skip your families arbitrary religious weekly ceremony of church so your parents unplug the router and lock the door leaving you home alone without internet
Jed,But then you discover you have an lte hotspot your pc can connect to
Jed,Feelsgoodman
Jed,Can't you just plug the router back in?
Jed,The door to the router is locked
Jed,I don't know where the key is
Jed,:(
Jed,Use a Bobby pin
Jed,How tho
Jed,Is it ez
Jed,??
Jed,It's just one of those little hole locks right?
Jed,Ye I think so
Jed,Lemme check
Jed,Yeah
Jed,I used to do that all the time as a kid
Jed,if you have enough data to get on discord you have enough data to look up how to pick locks
Jed,^
Jed,Okay
Jed,Let me discover a Bobby pins
Jed,Pin*
Jed,although you may end up convincing your parents that you're basically just slowly backing into the depths of hell and you'll be in even more trouble
Jed,just a warning
Jed,Yeah if you plug it back in they'll be angry
Jed,Risk/reward
Jed,My parents think I'm going to hell because I subscribe to evolution as the most practical model of biological origins
Jed,So that's a good point
Jed,I mean aside from the hell thing you'll still probably get in more trouble
Jed,They half jokingly talk about it like that. Not sure if they mean it
Jed,Feelsvadman
Jed,Pc thrown in trashcan 
Jed,Lol
Jed,I would kms
Jed,And sabotage my dad
Jed,oh yeah that was just fantastic when it happened
Jed,I just used it as a metaphor/emphasis thingy/whatever you would call it dammit it's been too long since I took english as a class
Jed,Wait
Jed,Jed will tweezers work?
Jed,I can't find Bobby pins
Jed,Probably not
Jed,if you're talking about a regular locked door a screw driver works
Jed,That too
Jed,at least my type of doors
Jed,A tiny one?
Jed,I have a tiny one
Jed,try it
Jed,Does it need to be flathead?

Jed,I love seeing different people's expectations for what's going to happen after this latest Sleepless Domain page. The next page is Good IMO https://t.co/vEKM2QRguf

Jed,they must be small scissors
Jed,Yes
Jed,Also now my mother hates me for not going to church

Jed,and they locked you out for not going to church?
Jed,Ye
Jed,They r dumb
Jed,Are they in the house right now?
Jed,Yes
Jed,I wouldn't lockpick with them there
Jed,thats risky
Jed,I confronted my dad and got yelled at basically

Jed,Gotta wait
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,he left
Jed,How good are you with web elements
Jed,You mean like website coding?
Jed,Yes

Jed,so terrible
Jed,Okay
Jed,I'll wait for fusion xd
Jed,"Dang shroud makes almost 250,000 a year just off twitch subs"
Jed,Assuming they are all the cheapest sub option
Jed,Wow thats what most houses cost where I live

Jed,@here cs:go in a lil bit?
Jed,or rivals
Jed,or anything
Jed,@here
Jed,anyone good with wordpress??
Jed,I am possibly down for things
Jed,sure
Jed,http://newtfilms.com
Jed,Newt Films
Jed,The Future of Filmmaking
Jed,@here
Jed,what do you guys think so far
Jed,NOt done
Jed,Just general theme n stuff
Jed,"it looks nice but one small thing, why is youtube green?"
Jed,All the bright colors make me feel like its and ad
Jed,maybe that's just me
Jed,they're not that bright
Jed,You got a reason why blue green yellow purple are your main colors
Jed,im gonna try and figure out how to change the stuff to red black and white
Jed,Thats our colors
Jed,I agree that youtube should be red for recognizeability
Jed,yeah
Jed,Cant figure out how to do it with the assets Im using
Jed,said bois
Jed,Oh in that case it's fine then
Jed,also a newt film logo or something instead of the cavern maybe?
Jed,thats why I asked if anyone is good with wordpress
Jed,or something film related at least
Jed,ALso thank you for feedback
Jed,okay our logo actually looks like ass
Jed,No if those are you colors then it makes more sense to stick to those instead
Jed,whats wrong with your logo?
Jed,I thought it was fine other than the art maybe having a few minor mistakes
Jed,
Jed,that just looks so ugly to me
Jed,Bleh
Jed,Put the newt on top of films
Jed,
Jed,This one looks good
Jed,On business cards
Jed,Just elegant
Jed,Simple
Jed,Not so IN YOUR FACE BYATCH
Jed,Eh
Jed,"I think if you put the newt on tip of films, starting from the right edge of the F and then extending to the end of the S, it'll look fine"
Jed,lol that logo took our guy like 6 months because hes a lazy piece of shit. I hardly want to ask him to do another thing. Gotta find another guy tbh
Jed,does anyone have the old frostbite logos. Also thank you @Rotomotorz
Jed,"However also make the height of the word newt taller than the gap between the top of the F and the top of the I, so it doesn't look like Fnewt films lol"
Jed,lmao gonna steal them 
Jed,no just curious
Jed,Lol frostbite
Jed,I built a new pc
Jed,So I lost them
Jed,be there soon octagon

Jed,Mob Psycho 100
Jed,"Eighth-grader Shigeo ""Mob"" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks. In order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Reigen Arataka, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Jed,no nerd
Jed,why
Jed,doc = too tired
Jed,gg
Jed,I'm super tired man
Jed,doc is a dork
Jed,.org
Jed,where did that joke originate?
Jed,Umm guys
Jed,Umm trap
Jed,@Rivals of Aether Someone play against my ori
Jed,@ me anytime to play
Jed,oh shit that's out?
Jed,goddammit I'm still stuck with my terrible internet
Jed,When do you think you'll be back?
Jed,shrugs
Jed,he's not getting better as fast as he was supposed to (largely because he's super stubborn and not doing all the stuff he's supposed to to help him get better) so I can't even really follow the doctor's estimate cause that was supposed to be sunday
Jed,is he fun tho?
Jed,yes
Jed,However I'm still in the SDing when going offstage due to not knowing when I can jump out of my arials phase.
Jed,lol
Jed,His recovery is definitely the best in the game if you are high and definitely the worst if you are low
Jed,well actually wrastor is probably better high
Jed,All around air is just as good as I thought it would be
Jed,he seems pretty nuts from what little I've seen
Jed,and I feel like he's gonna be one of the those characters with a steep learning curve
Jed,aka I'll probably suck at him
Jed,From what I can tell his weakness is having 0 kill setups
Jed,still gonna give him a shot once I'm back home
Jed,I think I'm going to try and get good at him
Jed,wait that seems kind of crippling
Jed,or does he just have enough stuff that can kill that it doesn't really matter?
Jed,His smash attack hitboxes are REALLY BIG
Jed,like BIG
Jed,its insane
Jed,like etalus big?
Jed,bigger
Jed,the fuck
Jed,etalus fsmash actually covers 1/4 - 1/3 of the stage (depending on the stage)
Jed,That is because he moves
Jed,not because the hitbox is big
Jed,it covers less space than etalus fsmash but the hitboxes on upsmash and downsmash are huge
Jed,so basically big band? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/276801025258684416/288837755247525889/bb-cmk.png
Jed,but with a small hurtbox
Jed,not that big
Jed,at some point we eventually need to play more SG
Jed,(I say while trying to learn blazblue)
Jed,Ori will be good at edgeguarding etalus
Jed,he has a move that is almost exactly like wrastors down smash
Jed,return of the downsmash vs tech wars of early 2017
Jed,@Sak von Sak I think Ori is going to be one of my favorite characters
Jed,@Jed ROA?
Jed,in a bit]
Jed,@ me when ready
Jed,@Max
Jed,@Max what are the best melee ai?
Jed,Link and captain falcon in vanilla
Jed,umm
Jed,But probably fox on the latest 20xx since he has actual tech skill
Jed,that's not what max said he said gannon was best
Jed,i don't remember the other one though
Jed,Max has done several ai tournaments and pretty sure link has won them all almost
Jed,Luigi
Jed,Wait.falcon may have been bad
Jed,Yeah Luigi and link I think
Jed,Me
Jed,Yeah kameron too

Jed,thats false
Jed,welcome to oregon
Jed,in the winter
Jed,there was a break yesterday for a few hours
Jed,and its only been three days
Jed,too bad its rain and not snow xd @ oregon
Jed,we actually had snow last year
Jed,but also rain
Jed,mostly just rain
Jed,I've seen it snow enough in a single night that it practically shut down the city for about a week
Jed,yay canada
Jed,woah
Jed,same
Jed,"except it was like 4"""
Jed,still basically shut down the city 
Jed,Yeah seriously
Jed,Oregon drivers are pussies
Jed,yeah thats pathetic
Jed,Gets single snow flake
Jed,to be fair
Jed,west salem is hills
Jed,"""SHUTDOWN WHOLE DAMN ROAD"""
Jed,and it was ice under snow
Jed,Ava Texans are no better with snow xD
Jed,also we have like what 1 snow plow?
Jed,"well there is no snow to speak of, ever"
Jed,"it was some weird freak of temperature and stuff where it snowed a ton, rained a bit, then the rain froze, the whole city was under like a foot of ice, massive power outages across the city, technically drivable but horrifyingly unsafe roads (which we used anyway to make it somewhere with power)"
Jed,at least in southern texas
Jed,one of my friends who lives three blocks from me had no power for three weeks
Jed,aaaAAAA
Jed,no power makes me wanna die
Jed,"no internet, no a conditioner/heater, to way to make food"
Jed,try no power and temperature below freezing
Jed,how did you live
Jed,we ran away to somewhere with power
Jed,"if you couldn't do that, layers and layers of clothing and blankets, use of fireplaces, sharing body heat, etc."
Jed,sounds terrible
Jed,sometimes im salty I never get snow but then I hear about how bad snowy places have it
Jed,"""sharing body heat"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Jed,"that's by far the worst I've seen, usually it isn't so bad"
Jed,but honestly snow's not all it's cracked up to be
Jed,it's nice for the first month or so
Jed,then it's kinda annoying
Jed,my childhood dreams are crushed
Jed,and come february/march you just want nothing to do it anymore
Jed,
Jed,yeah its novelty wears off fast
Jed,"skiing and skating and sledding and snowball fights are still fun, but you kinda stop doing any of that after the first bit"
Jed,I love ice skating but the nearest rink is like an hour away
Jed,rip
Jed,nowhere I've stayed in canada has had a rink more than like a fifteen minute walk away
Jed,time to move
Jed,15 minute WALK?
Jed,yeah
Jed,How many ice rinks must there be to have one so close to everyone
Jed,shrugs welcome to canada
Jed,also generally I've only stayed in family-focused residential areas so those tend to have rinks nearby
Jed,"To be sure of hitting the target, shoot first and call whatever you hit the target."
Jed,some quote ^
Jed,That sounds so awesome
Jed,I'm really into skating sports
Jed,I'm kinda good for a novice
Jed,Lodda fun
Jed,I'm pretty awful at em but they're a good time
Jed,@everyone let's do the Meetup in Canada
Jed,no
Jed,yeah
Jed,"I can't go to Canada, no way my parents would let me"
Jed,too far
Jed,good we don't want you
Jed,jk
Jed,depresso
Jed,that means max wouldnt go either
Jed,nah max is an adult
Jed,he's 17
Jed,and living at home
Jed,but will be 18 by the time we go anywhere
Jed,yeah but I'm sure our parents will still stop him
Jed,I'm just sad we don't have enough west coasters to justify going somewhere where there's in&out
Jed,yeah
Jed,I mean if you guys want to come out I wouldn't be opposed
Jed,eh transport'll be way more
Jed,and this way I don't have an excuse
Jed,they have them in texas
Jed,thats the furthest east I think
Jed,This is getting insane
Jed,I saw someone riding a jet ski on a road I sometimes drive on...
Jed,oh god that's amazing
Jed,Not if you live here and may have to evacuate.
Jed,We might be running out of roads to leave on.
Jed,true
Jed,So are you gonna leave soon
Jed,are things still good where you are?
Jed,We just learned that leaving is impossible at this point. So it looks like we are going to have to camp on our second story if things get bad.
Jed,For the moment though things are still okay.
Jed,but you mostly live up there anyway so...
Jed,True but we will have to cut the power to the house.
Jed,Well shoot
Jed,Stay safe man
Jed,that sucks
Jed,yeah stay safe and keep us posted
Jed,I'll update you guys if things get worse
Jed,Thanks for the support
Jed,np
Jed,Yo if you have to cut power you won't have discord right?
Jed,don't die
Jed,I have a phone now
Jed,do you have data tho?
Jed,yes
Jed,That's my number
Jed,(oh right it's the states data's way cheaper)
Jed,"@Max  question, if you do have to camp on the second floor, would it be possible just to cut power to the first floor?"
Jed,I'm not sure
Jed,woah what an idea
Jed,that could save my sanity
Jed,i ask cause one of my friends is in the same situation you might be in and they only cut breakers to the first floor
Jed,Ava it's literally flooding and you worry about wifi
Jed,it isnt about wifi

Jed,Still okay
Jed,that's good
Jed,mrd where are you at?
Jed,cause don't you live near max?
Jed,I doubt we'll get hurt. More likely our things will be ruined with water. Luckily we have flood insurance so that is covered as well.
Jed,"yeah, besides I've been EXTEMELY lucky for my street or anywhere near my house not to be flooded"
Jed,@Trapezoider am ready any time

Donald J Trump sits straight up in his interview chair. In his pitifully tiny hands, he hold a smartphone. He is using the front facing camera to check himself out, and preen himself up as he prepares to be on camera
TRUMP (TO SELF)
You're a winner Donald, a winner I tell yah
Donald winks to himself and clicks off the phone, and puts it into his pocket
DIRECTOR
President Trump, are we ready to roll yet sir?
TRUMP

You bet it James! 
Trump says as he winks
TRUMP
Are the incredible men and women on this set ready to capture my fantastic appearance today? 
JAMES
Yes President Trump. We have been preparing for this shoot for a few weeks. Were all very eager to get this over with.
TRUMP
Fantastic!
James walks out of frame and trump sits up extra straight in his seat.

Camera heads swivel into posistion

Action!
A slate man appears in front of the main camera and clicks the slate board.
James nods to trump
TRUMP
I will never forget, the day I won the election in 2016. It was amazing, truly fantastic. Really shows that america is a nation of faith, a nation of faith in me. Donald J trump. 
Trump looks down and takes a deep breath through the mouth
TRUMP
Sadly folks, crooked Hillary is trying to bring me down this election cycle. Shes trying to say I worked with Putin, really great guy by the way, to win last years election. That's why I need your help. I need you, and the rest of America to come together, and make this election great. So that I can win, and keep crooked politicians like Hillary and Berney out of office! They would make a huge...
Trump suddenly gets distracted and pulls his phone out of his pocket.
TRUMP
Hehe, Megan Kelly responded to my apology tweet
TRUMP
In Megan Kelly Voice Impersonation Mr Trump I find your lewd comments, rude and offensive
Rolls eyes at camera
TRUMP
I demand you make a more formal and respectful apology, I am uphalled!

Jed,"JAMES
whispering Donald, we need to get this back on track!
TRUMP
Oh, right
Trump puts the phone back into his pocket
TRUMP
And that is why I need your help to keep berney and Hillary out of office by voting me in instead. I promise, if you vote for me, I will literally buy all of your children I phone 8's. I have HUGE amounts of money because of how successful and fortunate I am! I swear if I wasn't for TRUMP brand I couldn't count a dime to my name, but I swear to God, you put my name and some god damned gold on a building, and you will be rich out of your mind
James can be seen making huge x motions with his hands
TRUMP
James why are you doing that with your hands
James walks into frame, and on set. 
JAMES
Donald, we talked about this extensively before hand. This is network television, you cant swear and say whatever the hell you want! I need you to tone it back, or were going to have to cancel this broadcast.
TRUMP
...
TRUMP
You know what James. I'm going to make you an offer.
James sighs and shakes his head in regret
JAMES
Whispers to self Oh lord what this time...

Jed,"TRUMP
 James, M gonna make you an offer, here it is. I will buy your entire studio and network, and you let me run this cast how I see fit. I have a HUGE message I am trying to get to the american people James.

You know what Donald, you do whatever the hell you want. You have infinite money, if you fuck up this broadcast, and get me in trouble with the network, I will let you handle it.

Jed,Brilliant example of how to make a great single player experience
Jed,yup
Jed,literally my main complaint is that that one semi-automatic rifle was kind of op but not super exciting to use
Jed,The carbine?
Jed,I think so
Jed,Yeah that thing was busted
Jed,yeah its was
Jed,I only use the pistol in machine gun for the first half of the game
Jed,Then shit got way too hard so I started using real guns
Jed,yeah the difficulty ramps way up in the last third or so
Jed,Now my go play Bioshock and BioShock 2 right
Jed,I should probably play those too
Jed,I bought the package all three remastered for 20 bucks

Jed,also imo the most fun gun combo is hand cannon + that rebel shotgun that lights people on fire
Jed,That thing didn't have any ammo though
Jed,yeah they're both pretty low on ammo
Jed,I wish I'd had more money on my plate through cause then I could have got more cool upgrades
Jed,I didn't say it was practical
Jed,I think we can all agree the repeater was booty though
Jed,which one's that?
Jed,It was like the machine gun but with the less ammo in the slower rate of fire. It was a vox gun
Jed,yeah
Jed,and takes fire up to be accurate
Jed,dude the insane asylum part was spooky
Jed,when ben franklins head rolled out i paused and walked away

Jed,Jed
Jed,Gaymez?

The demo is available to download through battle.net. It doesn't matter if you are new to the game because if we manage to get a big enough game the large number of players will balance out the more skilled players as they can be teamed against. I think this could be really fun so I hope enough of you are willing to give it a try for us to play! Confirmed players so far: Me, Sylki."

Jed,tuesday is hell tho

Jed,Ouch
Jed,yikes
Jed,6.5 hours of class spread haphazardly across 12 hours of time
Jed,HaA
Jed,Sucks for you mAtE
Jed,also what kind of whack scheduling led to this being a thing https://gyazo.com/66af9112c8a2d59d60c1de02a293ddcc

Jed,Gayms when I get home Bois hype
Jed,"two 1.5-hour segments of the same class, an hour and a half apart, in different lecture halls"
Jed,"on the flip side, for winter term (january-april) I have 7 fewer hours of class per week"
Jed,and no classes friday
Jed,seriously winter term is a joke for me https://gyazo.com/f2346dd6cd66473f5a2477a1cbe7f2a1
Jed,Gyazo
Jed,"12 hours a week, no friday classes, one online course"
Jed,Why would you get your classes so far apart?
Jed,Mine are 10 minutes apart
Jed,although for one of those I'll have to cross the campus in those 10 minutes oops
Jed,"cause these are all the only timeslots for these classes, or I used these specific ones in order to not have friday classes"
Jed,"also I like having spaced out classes, gives you time to relax and do nice things like eat or chill at the library in between"
Jed,I'd much rather have three hours of class with 3 hour gaps than three hours of straight classes with ten minute breaks and the rest of the day off
Jed,and honestly I'd put up with a lot for perpetual 3-day weekends
Jed,"which will probably translate to me doing a lot more out of town smash tournaments, especially if I can find people to carpool with -_-"
Jed,@Max how was your first day of college?
Jed,It was fine
Jed,Had to park super far away from my class
Jed,How were the classes tho
Jed,First day was just learning about the course
Jed,no real work
Jed,"oh yeah you've never had syllabus days before, have you?"
Jed,expect that for the whole first week
Jed,That's how it usually is
Jed,Whole first week?
Jed,"One of the first things my EDUC prof said to us is ""I like to cuss a lot so if that offends you please switch classes""."
Jed,yeah profs are also an interesting mixed bag
Jed,EDUC?
Jed,It is a required course where you learn about college and how to succeed in life
Jed,"also yeah for uni it's usually the first week, cause you've got your courses spread out by day (you start doing stuff in some courses but it's mostly review of previous material)"
Jed,seems like an easy A
Jed,that sounds either really useful or incredibly boring

Jed,@Sak von Sak stop playing psp and play rivals with me
Jed,"I'm not really in the mood (kinda platform fightered out, playing badly today and I'm frustrated)"
Jed,lets play a different game then
Jed,i need someone to hang out with
Jed,"housemates are already going to sleep, can't talk either way"
Jed,  
Jed,
Jed,@Mr. Airplane are you an uber driver now
Jed,no
Jed,oh lol
Jed,^
Jed,my stats prof opened our first class by just kind of playing jazz over the speakers for the first five minutes
Jed,but why
Jed,cause he's a super chill old guy
Jed,haha early classes
Jed,I already had an 830
Jed,and I have classes today until 8pm
Jed,tuesdays are hell
Jed,My mondays suck
Jed,But your tuesday seems worse than my monday
Jed,All my days are the same
Jed,I have class from 8:30-6:50
Jed,I've only got 6.5 hours total but they're spread out and I'm basically stuck on campus all day
Jed,That's the same with me
Jed,all my classes are like an hour apart
Jed,"I've got some half hour breaks, some hour and a half, some two hours, but never at convienient times to go back home until the end of the day"
Jed,You need that briefcase setup
Jed,"He just put up a slide that just says ""How not to fail STAT263 and any non-fakeable course"""
Jed,shots fired
Jed,"he just showed us his first year transcript, his highest mark is a 67 and he failed some"
Jed,what a baller
Jed,"and now he's literally going ""english.  I could fake that.  Calculus, not so much"""
Jed,his average was a 48
Jed,How did this mans become a professor?
Jed,he's telling the story of how he turned his life around
Jed,"and he actually just said ""I'm probably the only person teaching right now who had a year like this"""
Jed,"he says he's willing to print out a certificate that says ""For what it's worth, this is to certify that [YOUR NAME HERE] is, in fact, smarter than Professor Charles Arthur Molson"""
Jed,man gives no fucks
Jed,"""What I hope to hear said about me is 'Damn, that dumb son of a bitch can really teach'"""
Jed,and he's now pulling bad reviews from his own ratemyteacher page
Jed,"""if you're sleeping in my class, that's fine"""
Jed,now he's using a picture of grafitti from a queen's bathroom stall to demonstrate statistics
Jed,what a god
Jed,he's planning to use the distribution of cell phones ringing during his lectures as something we're going to study
Jed,"""When the grim reaper comes for you, you will never get these stat263 hours back"""
Jed,"""Ha! And you were wondering what scary thing to dress up as for halloween? LURKING VARIABLES"""
Jed,I figured three hours of stats every tuesday would suck but this man is great
Jed,"man has started cracking borderline dad jokes 
""Helen - the face that launched a thousand ships, and from whom we get the objective measure of beauty;  the milihelen, enough beauty to launch one ship"""
Jed,what a gOD
Jed,someone in one of my classes has the most fantasy-sounding first name I've ever seen - their name is literally Bronwyn
Jed,that is awesome
Jed,no idea if it's a guy or girl
Jed,"@Liberals Out of curiosity which of these people would be considered the most privileged, a gay white male, a straight black male, or a straight white female?"

Jed,yo anyone want to play l4d2 or csgo or something?
Jed,maybe
Jed,NO
Jed,Ava how do I get gud at pay
Jed,Osu
Jed,Jk osu is for gay retards with autism
Jed,"how did you manage to mispell osu as pay?  it literally requires not only both hands to be in the wrong place, it then requires one hand to overcorrect and end up in a different wrong place"
Jed,it's only three letters
Jed,that is honestly impressive
Jed,@trap kys
Jed,osu is for cool weebs
Jed,'cool weebs' is an oxymoron
Jed,uH no
Jed,you're a weeb too sylki
Jed,did I ever profess or pretend coolness?
Jed,o h
Jed,Sylki on on mobile
Jed,O is next to P
Jed,S is next is A
Jed,U is next to Y
Jed,Also auto correct
Jed,"the point was that o->p would put you towards the right, and u->y to the left"
Jed,but mobile autocorrect makes sense
Jed,Sylki
Jed,Can you become my basement space
Jed,lol
Jed,Slave
Jed,To do my hw
Jed,God damnit auto correct
Jed,the hell is going with your autocorrect
Jed,IDK bro

Jed,@Trapezoider @Sak von Sak Don't forget that we are going to try some SC2 tonight
Jed,k
Jed,bruh i think I'm tripping on acid or something
Jed,I felt something moving around in my headset and I took it off and saw a big earwig
Jed,so i threw it down
Jed,and now its gone
Jed,not in the headset or anywhere around it
Jed,wtf
Jed,and now its gonna take me 4 years to get the pads back on
Jed,update I am not on drugs I found the earwig and killed  it
Jed,I also only have 1 earpad on so far
Jed,gg
Jed,the task is done
Jed,literally 20 minutes later
Jed,I hate cloud 2's
Jed,0/10 don't use if you have anger problems

Jed,gross
Jed,that was in my headset
Jed,please delete your headset
Jed,@Max @Trapezoider when are we gonna starcraft?
Jed,I'm good whenever
Jed,or just do something in general
Jed,I vaguely remember we played once and you actually know what you're doing so I'm gonna advocate waiting for trap before we start
Jed,thats fine
Jed,@Trapezoider
Jed,@Sak von Sak I steam messaged trap and we should be good to go when he is done with H1Z1
Jed,sounds good
Jed,What is your main race?
Jed,protoss
Jed,white
Jed,dabbled in zerg but I don't really remember most of it
Jed,I usually play Terran but I've considered swapping to Protoss
Jed,i too dabbed on zerg
Jed,my brother played terran and I vaguely remember swarms of marines and medevacs that were a bitch to deal with as protoss if I didn't have templars
Jed,that can happen
Jed,medivacs I think
Jed,"shrugs I wouldn't really know, I was just mashing medicine and evacuate together"
Jed,Evil Emperor Zurg?
Jed,Woah
Jed,also if I remember correctly the reason I ended up mostly not playing zerg was cause my brother and dad both played a lot of protoss and used mostly flying stuff that I couldn't seem to beat cause the only big zerg units could only hit ground -_-
Jed,I'm sure there's a way around that but I have no idea what
Jed,Hydralisks
Jed,Corruptors
Jed,Vipers
Jed,"everying zerg is a -lisk, you'll have to remind me what all these things ar"
Jed,are hydralisks the flapping things that shoot bouncing shots?
Jed,no
Jed,those are mutalisks
Jed,those suck at anti air
Jed,they are flying anti worker mainly
Jed,shrugs for now I'll stick to protoss
Jed,you should because if you do we will have all 3 races in our ffa
Jed,noice
Jed,diversity
Jed,Diversity is our strenght. Socialism our goal. Equality our ideal. WE ARE LIBERALS!
Jed,Yo Kameron you wanna play some Overwatch @Mr. Airplane
Jed,a little bit later
Jed,in prac rn
Jed,sad
Jed,I'll continue with my spanish then
Jed,d'accord
Jed,I'm slightly bothered by the fact that he was talking about spanish and you repsonded in french
Jed,I'm slightly bothered by how long that took you to type

Jed,I have an 8:30 tomorrow
Jed,;-;
Jed,I have a 130 tomorrow and nothing else

Jed,I have 4 or 5 classes tomorrow

Jed,alright
Jed,hopefully you and trap finish around the same time
Jed,@Sak von Sak @Trapezoider Before we start I'm going to give you guys a refresher on invisible/flying units so someone isn't crushed due to not knowing how to beat either of those things

Jed,@Sak von Sak Is it possible to use a calculator to solve matrix's?
Jed,You would probably need a sophisticated calculator to do so
Jed,if you've got a graphing calculator
Jed,there's definately some online stuff that'll do it for you tho
Jed,My friends calculators have them
Jed,well rip I don't
Jed,"also, matrices is the plural of matrix"
Jed,^
Jed,whatever
Jed,I've been at this for like 4-5 hours
Jed,Is this graded?
Jed,I think I was intended to use a calculator but I didn't know that
Jed,yes
Jed,"just google ""online matrix solver"" and roll with that"
Jed,@Sak von Sak couple more games of rivals?
Jed,i need to prove myself
Jed,"naw, p5ing"

Jed,like holy shit
Jed,this game is amazing
Jed,What platform is that game on?
Jed,ps3 and ps4
Jed,"seriously tho, the story's getting super awesome, plus I'm currently in a position gameplay-wise where I'm having to pull out all stops to try and not die and the way they're coinciding is making everything even crazier"
Jed,"goddammit I'm basically out of mana and running low on mana-replenishing items, so I'm working with my team of mostly physical attackers and the boss KEEPS CASTING A THING THAT LETS HIM REFLECT PHYSICAL ATTACKS"
Jed,I DID IT

Jed,"It’s helpful of the college to provide financial aid to students who otherwise couldn’t afford school. I don’t know any veterans who are college aged, but if I did I would definitely tell them about the veteran’s benefits they can receive. Getting a good job is probably the most common goal for college students. Everyone with this goal should pay a visit to the CASA building to see career counselors and advisors. The CASE building is definitely a fun place to hang out and play video games!"

Jed,he had partial ownership of a goat while he was in the military and he loved it
Jed,it was his platoon's goat
Jed,Why does a platoon need a goat?
Jed,no idea
Jed,"but I vaguely remember it's a thing, at least it used to be"

Jed,was not a fun proof
Jed,I despise any subject which requires proofs
Jed,I actually really like proofs
Jed,but this one was terrifying
Jed,"I much prefer traditional equations, inequalities, and graphs."
Jed,proof are pretty much just applications of all of those things
Jed,but yeah I can see why you don't like em
Jed,I hated proofs initially
Jed,but I'm always a sucker for puzzle styled stuff so once I started getting the hang of them I had a good time
Jed,@Max
Jed,yeah?

Jed,@here gamezzz?
Jed,rivals?
Jed,sure
Jed,be there in a second
Jed,@Rivals of Aether any1 d0wn
Jed,@Max
Jed,be there in a second
Jed,I just got home and I've got early classes so I'll pass
Jed,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/177839064/
Jed,"Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share"
Jed,"Make games, stories and interactive art with Scratch. (scratch.mit.edu)"
Jed,I am a master game dev now go try out my newest title 
Jed,@Jed This gave me a 404 error
Jed,oops
Jed,idk
Jed,Your game is broken bro
Jed,I want to plaY it
Jed,404 for you too?
Jed,Ye
Jed,What's it about
Jed,try now
Jed,works now for me
Jed,its a work in progress
Jed,did you actually make this?
Jed,yes
Jed,the jump distance seems to be inconsistent
Jed,each jump goes the same height
Jed,or did you mean the pipes?
Jed,jumps
Jed,nope each jump is 10 pixels
Jed,I still have to add a scoreboard element and a background change
Jed,Now I want to try making something
Jed,scratch is fairly easy to learn
Jed,no actual writing code
Jed,its all in blocks for you to put together
Jed,how do you get it to restart without reloading the page
Jed,the green flag
Jed,oh
Jed,I could make a start button but that would be too much work
Jed,l a z y
Jed,wow this game is very hard
Jed,its flappy bird
Jed,but memes
Jed,i am aware
Jed,so my exam schedule just came out
Jed,I didn't quite pay attention to which of my classes do and don't have exams
Jed,"but as it turns out, I only have one exam"
Jed,so that worked out well
Jed,@Sak von Sak play rivals with me
Jed,"in a bit, studying for a midterm atm"
Jed,I will tho
Jed,get in here jed
Jed,ya big nerd
Jed,@Max play the ow halloweeb event with us we need a fourth
Jed,doing homework
Jed,@Sak von Sak nice name
Jed,cheers
Jed,I figured I'd go with the theme
Jed,but now that you're not supply depot anymore we need another supply depot
Jed,I'm back to that
Jed,yee
Jed,lol
Jed,@here ayy you guys wanna play some cs?
Jed,maybe yesterday
Jed,"gotta study and eat, but maybe later tonight"
Jed,I'm checking out dust_new
Jed,wanna queue with me?
Jed,instead of checking out dust new
Jed,Later maybe
Jed,I might play
Jed,In like a while
Jed,RIP my awesome winter term schedule
Jed,"dropped one of my courses for this term, replaced it with a different one next term (that everyone says is easier and the prof's not an ass, and where I can take either for my degree), and now I've lost my super easy schedule and no friday classes"
Jed,Rip
Jed,"on the flip side, at least this term should be manageable"
Jed,cause that one course was occupying like half my time and I was doing terribly
Jed,and I'd already gotten in a mini-fight with the prof
Jed,Yeah that's no good
Jed,What class is this?
Jed,"digital systems, it's basically agressive circuitry and the nuts and bolts of how computers are put together"
Jed,which should be super interesting
Jed,I agree
Jed,"but the prof subscribes to this ""innovative"" teaching model which is really good in theory - the dry lecture learning stuff is done outside of class, then class time is for application of what you've learned and you can ask questions and stuff really easily"
Jed,the problem is that he kinda forgot about the whole applying stuff in class part
Jed,"so it's pretty hard to make sense of anything cause a) first class after readings is a test on the readings without an opportunity to ask about anything you're confused about, then in between that and the other class of the week there's an ""in-class assignment"" which isn't done in class, and he doesn't reply to email questions about it so you still don't really know what you're doing for it, then the second class he takes up the test and stumbles around trying to answer questions about the actual content we're confused about"
Jed,"on top of which, there's labs every couple of weeks, which are even more complicated, and by terrible scheduling, I have other lectures during almost all the open lab sections where you can show up and work with the TAs to get stuff done (the only one that I can show up to I can only show up to half an hour of it, which isn't enough), and the software we have to work on is super buggy on my computer and periodically just freezes and deletes whatever project I was working on if I kill it with task manager"
Jed,"and when I asked him for an evening-long extention in light of this (was due at 4pm, but there was an open lab for it from 5-7 that night which I could go to), not only did he not give an extention, he also just gives instant zero to a late submission"
Jed,and that was going to happen pretty much every lab
Jed,so we got into a bit of an argument about that
Jed,this is also the course where everyone is slowly bailing
Jed,"I started out in a 5-person group, two people dropped, he mashed the remaining three together with two other groups so we then had an 8-person group, which has now dwindled to a 5-person group (4 now that I've dropped)"
Jed,"td;dr - cool sounding course, prof butchered any reasonable chance of understanding it and is also stupidly rigid in how he handles things, about half the class has dropped and I'm incredibly happy to be part of that half"
Jed,Sounds like hell
Jed,Meanwhile I am sitting here trying to be productive during my unexpected 1 hour break by writing out code on my phone
Jed,
Jed,you really need a laptop
Jed,Check it out
Jed,I really do
Jed,This is kind of painful
Jed,I can imagine
Jed,but seriously how are you doing the whole uni thing without a laptop?
Jed,are you taking notes by hand?
Jed,Yeah
Jed,It's not too bad
Jed,It just sucks when I have these breaks
Jed,"get a cheap laptop, do work during breaks"
Jed,I spend most of my breaks off the corner of one of the libraries doing assignments or studying
Jed,it's honestly really good for productivity
Jed,you can probably get a laptop that does what you need for a couple hundred bucks at most
Jed,somewhat related but Android studio makes me want to rip my toenails out
Jed,@Sak von Sak I approve the switch back to your old (and obviously superior) profile picture
Jed,eh I like them both but this one shows better in the discord bubble
Jed,@Rivals of Aether games?
Jed,I'm in
Jed,Girls can now join the boy scouts
Jed,...
Jed,Yup
Jed,I happen to remember something called the girl scouts existing so this seems pointless
Jed,Girl scouts leadership ran it into the ground
Jed,@Rivals of Aether games?
Jed,in a few minutes
Jed,"well rip me, 2-0'd one of my melee demons only to immediately lose my next two matches and not even make top 8"
Jed,"on the flip side, my record against sasquatch is now 3-15"
Jed,a marked improvement
Jed,also I had a weird run through like all the people I usually fight
Jed,"please let me fight someone other than sasquatch, dayman, and milk"
Jed,I almost always fight two or more of them per tournament
Jed,3/4 tournaments I've fought dayman and at least one of milk or sasquatch
Jed,holy shit one of the compsci academic advisers here is named Erin Gunsinger and that might be the most badass name I've ever heard
Jed,oh snap
Jed,thats lit
Jed,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Jed,COLLEGE APP DUE TOMORROW YOU FOOL
Jed,don't worry about it i believe in doing everything at the literal last second
Jed,SCREW YOU
Jed,@games here?
Jed,@here
Jed,im down later
Jed,@Jed gamezzz?
Jed,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Jed,did you deafen me fusion?
Jed,I got through the entire starcraft brood war soundtrack (47:50) 3 and a half times while doing homework. Why must it be so long.
Jed,are Koth maps bo3 now ? in comp ?
Jed,indeed my dude
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,anime
Jed,my dude
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,SLEEP
Jed,SOON
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,LEAVE ME ALONE
Jed,@Sak von Sak sleep is for the week
Jed,@Sak von Sak would you rather sleep or watch anime i already know its watch anime to comoooon
Jed,grumble
Jed,what would we watc
Jed,"black clover, my hero academia, monster"
Jed,I've already watched like all of mha
Jed,at least all that's dubbed
Jed,"ew Sylki, you refuse to watch subbed even if thats all there is ? ? ?"
Jed,no that's not what I said
Jed,I've watched a lot of things that have only sub
Jed,sounds like it
Jed,and a lot of subs for stuff where I didn't like the dub
Jed,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Jed, An error occurred: Error: socket hang up
Jed,"also ava just to clarify that discussion cause I wasn't paying a ton of attention (and was also like half asleep), MHA has simultaneous sub and dub, the dub is really good but delayed by about a week, which I'm willing to wait"
Jed,o h  I see
Jed,Is being straight kinda gay
Jed,i mean think about it
Jed,you're into someone who sucks dick
Jed,@Sak von Sak rivals in 30?
Jed,Yes
Jed,eh sure
Jed,we could do a 4 man tourney if @Max is down
Jed,yee
Jed,@Max you down my dude?
Jed,octagon why
Jed,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Jed,I can't tell if you just did that as a counterpoint to my name or if you're carefully avoiding Zack Attack
Jed,Doing school reading. We'll see if i can play or not.
Jed,the world may never know
Jed,people only play ori now and its annoying as hell
Jed,ori's kinda broke
Jed,and easier rushdown than wrastor
Jed,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Jed,"kk, gonna make a bathroom run first"
Jed,Can't sorry busy with school work
Jed,just play anyways
Jed,read while playing=profit
Jed,do school later
Jed,no
Jed,ez
Jed,
Jed,also if we do a tourney you can play during offtime
Jed,@Max doki doki literature club?????
Jed,what?
Jed,it says you're playing it
Jed,It's more important than his schoolwork
Jed,I just finished my school work
Jed,then join us my dude
Jed,eh
Jed,mini tourney
Jed,I only have like 25-30 minutes of free time before I need to start on more school
Jed,that's enough time
Jed,ye
Jed,Ava's comments on this game make me want to continue
Jed,we wanna see where everyone stands in skill rn
Jed,and octagon's like good at this game now
Jed,keeping it close with me in kragg dittos
Jed,I know I've played him a lot
Jed,come on you can play it whenever
Jed,Also I'll lose because you are all warm and my first 5 or so games I suck
Jed,wrastor is hard man
Jed,we'll open with round robin
Jed,"and then top two play for 1st, bottom two play for 3rd"
Jed,Another time
Jed,bruh
Jed,I don't feel up to it right now
Jed,and I know it will take longer than I have
Jed,30 MINUTES HUH
Jed,dear friendo
Jed,if you don't want to play with us
Jed,just say so
Jed,don't make them excuses
Jed,Miraculous Youngster is a beast ow team

Jed,"@Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane I started my assignment at 11:00 which is almost exactly 30 minutes after I sent my message. I do not lie and I did indeed have a school assignment to do. After I finished it, you guys were playing csgo which I had no interest in therefore I didn't feel the need to say anything about finishing. I don't make things up or lie. If I simply didn't want to play I would have said so, like I do whenever Overwatch is suggested. In those cases I'm sure you can remember many ""no I don't want to""'s. If you want I can even screenshot my ceritficate of completion of the assignment that I am emailed if you do not believe me."
Jed, best emote
Jed,
Jed,"K fair @Max, you can understand our assumption tho"
Jed,"Yeah I understand, I just wanted to clarify my innocence."
Jed,Idk still seems shday to me
Jed,"on an unrelated note, who's down to do a 5-queue with our names as Zack Attack, Zack Defense, Zack Sp. Attack, Zack Sp. Defense, and Zack Speed? @Cs:go"
Jed,"not now, but like, tonight some time"
Jed,I call Zack Speed
Jed,Yee
Jed,also I have more work tonight so maybe not
Jed,we'll see
Jed,I'm doing math now but I have a paper later
Jed,we'll see I guess
Jed,try to get as much done as you can
Jed,btw I'm going to be carving my profile picture into a pumpkin for halloween
Jed,the terran crest?
Jed,yes
Jed,that's pretty sweet
Jed,Its probably my favorite faction logo of all time
Jed,"all the sc ones are pretty sick, personally I prefer the protoss one"
Jed,go figure
Jed,its also cool
Jed,"I'm also pretty partial to the persona 5 player faction/crew logo, though it's not the kind of thing you can engrave on a pumpkin, at least not easily"
Jed,thats in interesting one
Jed,it's also kinda weird cause you don't actually get a character who wears a hat until pretty late in the game
Jed,and it's not even really a top hat
Jed,@Sak von Sak  I just started doki doki and i'm so on edge because the only thing i've heard about it is what you put in the memes channel
Jed,lol
Jed,I haven't gotten far enough for anything to actually happen either
Jed,but I'm terrified of everything
Jed,Its quite an experience
Jed,and there's this tiny part of me that thinks it might all just be a huge meme and it's actually a totally normal story and they just got everyone to say it goes hard in the psychological horror
Jed,which would be really funny
Jed,but I'm hoping that doesn't happen
Jed,
Jed,oh dang I have to write a poem?
Jed,yup
Jed,it doesn't have to make sense
Jed,just do what I did and choose your favourite word from each page and see where it ends you up
Jed,or be super tactical and choose the ones you think will impress your future waifu(?)
Jed,you guys gotta pick words to please a specific girl!!
Jed,^ was about to say that
Jed,yea
Jed,WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBS
Jed,"yeah I noticed, but they jump when I pick darker words"
Jed,I picked based that way and 16/20 seemed to make the purple hair girl happy so.... shrugs
Jed,
Jed,I think they jump for the stuff they like
Jed,yes
Jed,
Jed,THATS STILL SPOOKY
Jed,also I've barely gotten past the poem bit so don't say anything that happens after that
Jed,got it
Jed,"except maybe who ended up the happiest from your poem, cause curiosity"
Jed,spoiler-free catholic discord
Jed,yeah I wanna know too :0
Jed,whoever you choose the most words for you spend the day with at the club before reading poems
Jed,well obviously i'm going for yuri because she's best girl
Jed,nO
Jed,ew
Jed,Natsuki > Sayori > Yuri
Jed,wow
Jed,i guess it's ok to be wrong
Jed,Sayori > Natsuki > Yuri
Jed,Natsuki is a weeb and a tsundere ! ! Tsunderes are funny characters
Jed,natsuki is trash
Jed,Yuri is trash
Jed,no u
Jed,chill
Jed,in the small portion I've played I'm gonna have to agree with smithy here
Jed,oh boy
Jed,aaAAAAA
Jed,not necessarily on the best girl part cause I'm not far enough to have an opinion on that yet
Jed,but on the fact that natsuki seems annoying
Jed,shes funny imo
Jed,shrug
Jed,I don;t like tsunderes
Jed,"the general archetype works fine, it's just when it's played totally straight that it's annoying"
Jed,"you can either use it as a small part of the character (see: kurisu in steins gate), or blow it wildly out of proportion for comedic purposes (see: nichijou)"
Jed,"wait, who's the tsundere in nichijou?"
Jed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQq5d6v59xg
Jed,Nichijou - Clean Up
Jed,Nichijou - Clean Up Scene from Episode 18 Episode 18: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pj5IoTz_cU&list=PLosfF8MlHstRb3DaUmdL5iIhdTf2A0w7I
Jed,oh right I totally forgot about her lol
Jed,literally the most tsundere character I've ever seen
Jed,welp
Jed,"in an epic lack of proper group communication (my fault as well), two separate group members each did about half of the project"
Jed,now we're gonna have to compare and see whose stuff to keep
Jed,You mean you split into 2 teams and each did the same half?
Jed,naw we just figured we'd get started on it before discussing it with the group (I didn't bother telling them cause they didn't start early last time and I just dropped a 2/3 finished project on them and said do the rest and that worked out just fine)
Jed,but we both decided to start and not tell anyone
Jed,oh okay
Jed,Mine would have been funnier
Jed,and cause it's programming it's entirely possible that even if we did exactly opposite halves we won't be able to just mush them together
Jed,well it does look like we did nearly opposite halves
Jed,so at least it'll be easier than if we'd both done totally different parts
Jed,"@Rivals of Aether My opinions on each characters worst matchup                                                  Wrastor>Maypul
Zetterburn>Wrastor
Absa>Kragg
Etalus>Zetterburn
Orcane>Etalus
Kragg>Orcane
Zetterburn>Absa
No apparent counter>Forsburn"
Jed,btw Good in matchup>Character being countered
Jed,not sure about the kragg > orcane thing
Jed,In my experience it is true because he can power through bubbles
Jed,his only way to power through bubbles is sideb
Jed,which is really easy to counter
Jed,thats enough
Jed,you can get through and immediately put yourself in a terrible position
Jed,worst matchup does not mean bad
Jed,its cause max always beats me in that matchup 
Jed,I don't think orcane has any matchups that are very bad at all
Jed,altought i agree that kragg counters orcane for the following reasons
Jed,all of his moves slightly outrange or outprioritize orcanes options
Jed,"I feel like zetter, absa do better against orcane"
Jed,orcanes biggest strength is edgegarding and kragg cant be edgeguarded
Jed,you can't out-camp absa with bubbles
Jed,orcane beats both of them imo
Jed,the weight matchup is wierd
Jed,rocks>bubbles
Jed,and I dunno if zetter's actually good but I randomly pulled my half-decent zetter and beat kameron
Jed,if you get hit by kragg as orcane you're pretty much dead
Jed,eh only if he's got the right setups in place
Jed,like only if I can bully you offstage into rock rock rock rock
Jed,Kragg gets huge punishes of almost everything
Jed,^
Jed,you just have not figured it out yet
Jed,yes but I feel like he blows at getting in
Jed,his biggest weakness is his approach sucks
Jed,i kinda disagree
Jed,eh
Jed,His approach is fine
Jed,my defense on orcane is just good
Jed,speaking of rivals anyone wanna play
Jed,im down after dinner
Jed,I'm down
Jed,lol maybe in a little bit
Jed,4 man tourney les go bois
Jed,maybe we'll get that 4-man tourney going
Jed,surprised one challenged my forsburn statement
Jed,i have to do it soonish tho
Jed,none of us know forsburn
Jed,^
Jed,i think he gets countered by iceguy
Jed,he can combo etalus really well but maybe
Jed,"generally speaking though, my general reasoning for why kragg >>> orcane doesn't entirely hold up is just from fighting kameron a ton, going more or less even with my kragg and then doing about the same with my worse characters"
Jed,which doesn't quite make sense
Jed,you put orcane >>> etalus and my etalus usually does alright
Jed,Kameron plays against 3 Kragg players and is just good at the matchup
Jed,well i have tons of practice against kragg
Jed,fair
Jed,also yeah we have all kind of gravitated over to the rock beetle
Jed,I'm going to make a more detailed ROA stats/opinions list shortly
Jed,also I've gotta say I love octagon's kragg
Jed,it's got the same dumb reads I get only more
Jed,although as soon as I started reading his reads things went downhill
Jed,cause he goes for the same reads a lot
Jed,ill be there at 7 and then we can do a 4 man tourney
Jed,@Sak von Sak GET IN HERE BOIIII
Jed,finishing a bagel then I'm in
Jed,@Sak von Sak how long does it take to eat a bagel?
Jed,long time
Jed,is actually several bagels
Jed,with a bunch of stuff on them
Jed,"I just got my first ""ending"" and I don't know how I feel"
Jed,"good job, queen's 
http://www.cp24.com/news/330-charges-laid-33-arrested-during-homecoming-at-queen-s-university-1.3634572"
Jed,"330 charges laid, 33 arrested during homecoming at Queen's University"
Jed,"Police say they laid hundreds of charges during Queen's University homecoming celebrations in Kingston, Ont., over the weekend."
Jed,"and I'm assuming one of those would involve one the brother of one of my housemates, who got stabbed in the face"
Jed,"(he's fine, more or less, but he'll probably have a scar)"
Jed,good old homecoming
Jed,props on them for doubling the numbers
Jed,on them?
Jed,to them?
Jed,I think 'to them'
Jed,^
Jed,yeah
Jed,unfortunatley I care not enough to fix my bad grammar
Jed,@Sak von Sak friendlies?
Jed,sure
Jed,get in here nerd
Jed,"sec, bathrooming first"
Jed,"This is very important
Some guy on our team was 1-13 and we're like ""Darius you're shit at this game""
AND THIS MAN GOES ""Oh yeah well i can speak 2 languages"""
Jed,"like good for you, you still suck ass at league dont play ranked"
Jed,Gottem
Jed,Welp today's the day we get new rivals characters and I've got lectures and meetings till 930 and a few tests to study for
Jed,rip
Jed,I actually have my first class off
Jed,So I'm testing the new characters right now
Jed,Clairen is super fun
Jed,Ranno as seems fun
Jed,general playstles?
Jed,Clairen looks like she will be a all around character. Her neutral and punishes both look good. Ranno looks to be a powerhouse on stage that will be easily gimped.
Jed,first impressions
Jed,I have a feeling there is going to be at least 1 character (I'm thinking absa at the moment) who is going to do AWEFUL against Clairen.
Jed,do either of them have the nice movement à la zetterburn?
Jed,"mostly clairen, I enjoy not getting gimped a ton so I feel like I'll probably like her more"
Jed,Froggy boi seems op
Jed,"all in all, we need more non-kragg mains in this discord so maybe this will help"
Jed,Yeah I'ma get the dlc
Jed,"we basically have two and a half kraggs, one and a half orcanes, and a wrastor"
Jed,I'm kinda an everything
Jed,yeah but your kragg's probably your best
Jed,"maybe I'll adjust down to just two kraggs - me, kinda you, kinda max"
Jed,@Rivals of Aether If anyone wants to help me test Ranno and Clairen just @me.
Jed,The amount of creative potential present in Clairen's increased hitpause on tipper is huge.

Jed,;_;
Jed,
Jed,eh I'm not complaining
Jed,we needed a hype falcon
Jed,nah
Jed,too many falcons
Jed,two?
Jed,two is too many?
Jed,yes
Jed,I'm pretty sure S2J has never done better than 0-2 at summit
Jed,he really shouldnt go
Jed,i just wish pewpewu got the w
Jed,what about the eight foxes (and m2k's kind of a fox)
Jed,that's literally half the summit

Jed,"character breakdown (including dual mains):
Fox - 8
Falco - 1
Marth - 1
Sheik - 3
Puff - 1
Peach - 1
Falcon - 2
Luigi - 1
Yoshi - 1"
Jed,the best part is that a fox probably wont win
Jed,unless you count armada
Jed,which I did
Jed,the real dream is amsa winning
Jed,no
Jed,"the highest paying tourney, ever"
Jed,m2k winning is the dream
Jed,"just, surprise yoshi wins"
Jed,"rough order of what I want to see: Amsa, Plup, Hax, Blea Gelo, S2J, Axe"
Jed,pulpW
Jed,@Sak von Sak rivals in 30????

Jed,@Sak von Sak get in here famerino
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,I'm still eating
Jed,i cry
Jed,it's only been like 25 minutes
Jed,I'm torn between finishing this and not
Jed,cause it's so good
Jed,but I'm so full
Jed,and it's so salty
Jed,what is it?
Jed,there's like no moisture left in my mouth
Jed,I made the most badass sandwich
Jed,"i say, toss it in da trash"
Jed,and come play with me
Jed,"I cooked a bunch of beef and mushrooms in garlic butter, those + turkey + boursin on a pretzel bun"
Jed,unbelievably good
Jed,you know whats even better
Jed,playing roa
Jed,fine I'll do a quick bathroom run then fight you

Jed,Same
Jed,I want to drop it so bad
Jed,colour me throroughly confuzzled
Jed,Shh it's fine
Jed,I'm confused too
Jed,Bout why we have a league channel
Jed,I think foosion still plays every now and then
Jed,But with who?
Jed,inappropriate name
Jed,actually his name
Jed,oh yeah I've seen him a few times
Jed,I thought you just like didn't want to type his name 
Jed,@Max
Jed,yeah?
Jed,your dad and I have something new to get along about
Jed,Factorio

Jed,World's Best Smash 4 Player Is Worn Down By Haters And Harassment
Jed,"For 13 minutes, Gonzalo “Zero” Barrios’ face barely moved. It was the Grand Finals match of a Super Smash Bros. Wii U tournament, and Barrios, the best Smash player in the world, was squaring off against a formidable opponent. A few feet away, Barrios’ bodyguard kept a lookout for a man who’d threatened to be there, in wait, with a gun aimed at the champion gamer."
Jed,@Mr. Airplane Someone asked me to tutor them how much should I charge?
Jed,"I don't know what a reasonable amount is, but make sure you start by asking what they'd be willing to pay first, in case it's way more than what you were gonna ask for"
Jed,also depends on what you're doing
Jed,i charge people $5 to look at their completed code if it doesnt work and i fix it
Jed,one guy literally just forgot to indent something
Jed,i hit the tab key once and got $5
Jed,but if its something more important and difficult like physics definetly raise ur price
Jed,also little haggling tip if they tell you to make an offer always ask more than you want
Jed,that way when you lower your price to what you want they feel like they're getting a deal
Jed,@Rivals of Aether games?
Jed,@Max
Jed,What is it?
Jed,@Jed
Jed,rivals?
Jed,not until my rehabilitation (spelling?) is complete
Jed,oh
Jed,@Sak von Sak play some RoA with me my dude

Jed,so that one of us doesn't have to sit out?
Jed,oh right max isn't playing
Jed,max isnt gonna play
Jed,nvm

Jed,I'll be in in like 5 minutes
Jed,mmmk
Jed,aye boiz I'm in top 500 of rivals

Jed,@Max I now am able to accept the rivals skill gap as you have 198 hours compared to my 39
Jed,well I got to my first ending in doki doki literature club
Jed,conclusion - should not have done this right before going to bed
Jed,What did you think of the game?
Jed,also did you see the title screen after finishing
Jed,Yup
Jed,Title screen was fucked
Jed,I  don't really consider that me finishing the game
Jed,I'm not letting it end like that
Jed,yeah you gotta play more
Jed,it only gets better from here
Jed,canada cup's looking pretty damn good
Jed,"we've already got armada, leffen, m2k signed up"
Jed,why do we need blea gelo at summit when the best luigi in the world is already attending
Jed,because the best luigi in the world doesn't play luigi
Jed,this is true
Jed,wait are we even refering to the same person who are you talking about

Jed,and I'm kinda all smashed out
Jed,and hella salty
Jed,I just did worse than I ever have at a kingston tournament
Jed,and then proceeded to play like two hours of salty fox dittos
Jed,I have reached an impressive level of simmering anger at this point
Jed,nah just do it
Jed,play me fool
Jed,I GOT 17TH
Jed,I DID WORSE THAN SENDO
Jed,AND I LOST TO BUCKTOWN
Jed,yeah but you can get first in the 1v1 against me in rivals
Jed,AND QUINCY
Jed,QUINCY WAS 22 SEED
Jed,the two hours of salty fox dittos did help me get my fox back on track
Jed,but I really can't face more platform fighters right now

Jed,yeah but like

Jed,ecksdee
Jed,still pretty annoyed because I'm usually super consistent and I just played like ass today
Jed,and there's a monthly tomorrow and my confidence has gone down the drain
Jed,"lololol I was on commentary for a bit on the stream, I watched a bit and due to our shitty mic it sounds like I have some super weird accent that's a blend of like scottish and australian"
Jed,@Rotomotorz do you want to do 5 tp mission
Jed,i already did
Jed,@everyone Sylki and I are currently hosting a creative writing project. In this project we are going to be agreeing on a basic story premise and taking turns writing chapters after that. We already have 4 people and are looking for 1 more so please PM me if you're interested. We are looking to make a serious story so if you plan on meming your way through it don't bother signing up.
Jed,"Sylki, that's just how you sound normally"
Jed,What do you mean?
Jed,look up a couple of messages
Jed,I was replying to his earlier statement
Jed,"also, I did better at the monthly (waaaay more stacked) than the weekly -_-"
Jed,wait the pyro has a jetpack now\
Jed,ok
Jed,It's shit
Jed,It's really really bad
Jed,okay but like
Jed,still
Jed,I've been playing all of yesterday and today
Jed,@Max I met a good wrastor
Jed,"welp at the monthly, top 8 was initially 5/8 kingston people, and now we've reached top 3 and it's just the out of town people"
Jed,"also top two seeds from my pool both made top eight, backing up my claim that I got the hardest pool"
Jed,"except maybe the ryan ford, sandman, sasquatch pool"
Jed,that one was pretty viscious
Jed,@everyone I need a new headset anyone have any legit suggestions
Jed,"I've got a razer kraken, it's pretty good"
Jed,thats what i got right now
Jed,i was gonna get another one unless i got a better suggestion
Jed,get some sennheisers
Jed,Cloud 2's are good

Jed,@Sak von Sak fight me rivals lets go
Jed,in a bit
Jed,nah right now
Jed,lets go
Jed,ok fine later
Jed,@Max what were you gonna say my dude
Jed,I was going to say you should know not to disturb those in the literature club
Jed,im guessing you dont want to play rivals
Jed,Hyperx cloud 2's
Jed,MAX YOU'RE SCARING ME
Jed,why?
Jed,I just meant that most people playing DDLC don't want to stop because they want to see what happens
Jed,this game's scary enough without slightly suspect phrasing outside it too
Jed,@Jed fite me
Jed,no
Jed,@Max i downloaded starcraft
Jed,"Doing something, I'll be there soon"
Jed,not too soon though
Jed,Sylki and I can teach you
Jed,I barely get what I'm doing
Jed,but I can help
Jed,@Trapezoider Kameron is learning starcraft if you want to help educate him
Jed,Lots of quotes tonight eh?
Jed,doctor
Jed,more like
Jed,test proctor
Jed,gottem
Jed,rekeronied
Jed,@Rivals of Aether I beat someone on the ladder who had around 1200 rank points!
Jed,Noice
Jed,"My group for one of my classes is writing a report, one section is on ""issues and lessons learned"", and one thing that happened was we asked our assigned TA - a guy named Hang - for help and advice on part of our presentation (which was a required thing) and he didn't get back to us for like a week, literally until the evening before the presentation and after we'd handed in the slides and couldn't change them anymore.  We're having a dilemma on whether we should phrase that problem as ""he left us Hanging."""
Jed,Fucking Hang
Jed,he was actually super nice
Jed,"but at the same time, he'd better be given that he left us hanging for a week and we ended up handing in slides with a few major mistakes"
Jed,"also, high quality google docs recognizes all of these names except one"
Jed,how does it recognize Sandarusi but not Mallany?
Jed,the glock is better than the deagle because it has more bullets
Jed,Is that why the zeus is the worst weapon
Jed,
Jed,yeah
Jed,thats why you never buy armour
Jed,it has 0 bullets
Jed,True
Jed,Yo
Jed,You wanna help me code
Jed,Tru
Jed,no
Jed,Go away Jed
Jed,gottem
Jed,what do you need help with?
Jed,"""I don't see why you have such a huge problem with this, it's super common""
""So was the plague."""
Jed,I am making a timer thingy
Jed,in what language tho
Jed,processing
Jed,
Jed,xd
Jed,i would help but i gotta do college apps
Jed,@Sak von Sak help doctor
Jed,You baited me
Jed,but i said no tho
Jed,Baited
Jed,I'm writing a report atm
Jed,big group thing
Jed,Double baited
Jed,can help him later tho
Jed,never used processing tho
Jed,The logic of the code still applies
Jed,chudat fox
Jed,ez
Jed,vs m2k ganon
Jed,Woah
Jed,ye that actually happened
Jed,AND NOW ITS MANGO MARIO VS AXE YUNG LINK
Jed,Of all the days to have a 5-hour group meeting and then go to the gym
Jed,Sounds like I'm missing some hype stuff
Jed,axe op
Jed,why is he sticking to falco
Jed,i dunno
Jed,oh
Jed,nvm
Jed,lets go
Jed,monkaS
Jed,oh

Jed,that sopo is spicy
Jed,ye boi
Jed,rip chu
Jed,@Jed
Jed,happy birthday tomorrow bro
Jed,Update your steam wish llist
Jed,FeelsBirthdayMan
Jed,
Jed,Happy 17
Jed,but for real update that wishlist boiiii
Jed,I do not require games
Jed,this match is nuts
Jed,I've been thinking and I think its possible we will have more fun at a meetup if we don't go to an event. Does anyone else think this may be the case?
Jed,"the meetup might be more fun, but if I'm paying for travel and a hotel I'd prefer to get both that and an event out of it"
Jed,if we need to schedule it so that we can all come and it doesn't line up with an event I'm fine with that too
Jed,im kinda with max on this one
Jed,but an event would be fun tho
Jed,would it have to be an event with melee tho?
Jed,probably since that is the only game that enough of us play
Jed,also the only game we could enter as well as spectate
Jed,Someone could bring their laptop for rivals?
Jed,I could
Jed,I'm sure someone else could as well for multiple setups
Jed,That's be dope
Jed,Idk if I can come though
Jed,i could prolly run roa on my surface XD
Jed,I could bring mine
Jed,but me being able to go is gonna depend on a whole bunch of stuff
Jed,I'd need to get an internship over the summer and be able to take some time off
Jed,Depends on the price for me
Jed,well we should try to make it happen bois
Jed,we've been planning something like this for 1.5 years now
Jed,agreed
Jed,Yeah I'm saving up to move out though so I have to decide if I'm willing to spend
Jed,And set myself back
Jed,to move out???
Jed,why would you move out
Jed,I'll be 18 in a yeat
Jed,yeah but why would you want to move out
Jed,I'm ready to be independent
Jed,you've got a free home w/ utilities and food and everything
Jed,Yes
Jed,its not ideal but it is super practical
Jed,I mean basically I get rekt if my parents find out
Jed,So if that happens leaving will be necessary
Jed,it's something you should take advantage of until you have a consistent source of money that can cover your rent and food and utilities
Jed,Thats called addiction folks
Jed,Willing to alter your life for a substance
Jed,No
Jed,That's one reason
Jed,also that's not the definition of addiction by a long shot
Jed,^
Jed,addiction is defined by a physical and mental dependance on a substance
Jed,I'm aware thats not the definition
Jed,If I get a roommate or 2 I could cover rent rn
Jed,I'm just ready to be on my own
Jed,"also, just a recommendation, don't just drop this on your family out of the blue"
Jed,Idk my family is great and I love them
Jed,so tell them
Jed,don't make it a surprise
Jed,I will
Jed,or they'll be incredibly pissed
Jed,OR just dont and stay with them
Jed,Breaks over boiz
Jed,breaks?
Jed,I'm loving how all the dreamhack trophies are breaking
Jed,did Hbox's break?
Jed,someone's buying cheap trophies
Jed,yeah
Jed,the base came off
Jed,lol
Jed,https://twitter.com/LiquidHbox/status/922288824620695553
Jed,sigh
Jed,also do you guys think hbox is #1 in world rn?
Jed,yes
Jed,me too
Jed,yeah he's going pretty ham
Jed,also s2j definitely top 10 at this point
Jed,even though I think he's boring
Jed,but do I really wanna play doki doki
Jed,also @Mr. Airplane I was on break at work
Jed,Play it
Jed,Play it
Jed,@The Rona How far are you?
Jed,This is a fun game
Jed,Yuri is coming over to my house today
Jed,hawt
Jed,❤
Jed,I chose Natsuki
Jed,Ew
Jed,We got to make cupcakes
Jed,so this is a dating sim?
Jed,it looks like one but it really isn't
Jed,its a psychological horror game
Jed,It needs to be played blind so don't look up stuff about it
Jed,is it a sound based game?
Jed,smell?
Jed,its a visual novel
Jed,do I need to provide my own blindfold?
Jed,how do I play a visual novel blind?
Jed,bad game design imo
Jed,you really don't need to take that out of context
Jed,yeah
Jed,but it was funny
Jed,btw @The Rona I only chose Natsuki because Sayori wasn't an option. She was my favorite.
Jed,why the heck is everyone so obsessed with Yuri
Jed,shes dumb
Jed,I'm not sure
Jed,Once everyone has completed the game I'm going to make a poll
Jed,Yo I read a book with Yuri ok
Jed,best girl poll?
Jed,She liked my poem
Jed,You do things with whichever girl liked your poem
Jed,So if a different one had you would have done something with her
Jed,shhhhhhhh
Jed,Maybe
Jed,not maybe its a fact
Jed,I wanted Monika but then I realised that she wasn't an option
Jed,;-;
Jed,lol
Jed,@Rivals of Aether someone fight me real quick
Jed,Fuck me this game
Jed,Oh poor doctor
Jed,You ain't seen nothing yet
Jed,how long is the game?
Jed,This just got super weird
Jed,It's a few hours

Jed,Happy birthday @Jed
Jed,Happy birthday!!  @Jed
Jed,they grow up so fast 
Jed,Can it be considered growing up when Kameron's testosterone levels stay negative every year
Jed,"so for a big group project, we have do peer reviews where we basically give all our group members marks based on how good they were, and we have to write a paragraph or so for each of them explaining why we gave those marks"
Jed,which is a pain
Jed,but at least the sample paragraphs are hilarious
Jed,here are a few samples:
Jed,"""Candorsnaffity Hixelbröd was an annoying teammate"""
Jed,"""he agreed that he'd do the sushi-ionization module by Sunday afternoon"""
Jed,"""Prosnitau Sgrachita de la Mnirhoihoi was good, helpful and co-operative."""
Jed,"""V'snl'chm'tkn!k of the Fortress of Doom (that's me) was an effective worker in this
assignment"""
Jed,"also I just skimmed over the way you're supposed to break down marks (that I totally ignored initially), which contains this gem: A mark of seven indicates someone who leaps tall buildings in a single bound, walks on water, and solves NP-complete problems in linear time."
Jed,@here gamerinos anyone???
Jed,Yee
Jed,@Sak von Sak play dem games with me and birthday boi
Jed,@Max you too
Jed,gotta finish these stupid peer reviews
Jed,just do it later
Jed,boom problem solved
Jed,it's due tonight
Jed,I already left it to the last minute
Jed,Doki Doki is okie doki
Jed,     
Jed,same
Jed,"My stats prof: ""Just then, you assumed that I was telling the truth, because what I was saying was plausible.  Just like how you assume I have the credentials to teach this course."""
Jed,Same
Jed,The teachers are on strike where I live and i am not getting compensation for the missed school even though i paid for it if you guys can take like 1 minutes jsut to fill out this petition giving students compensation for missed days i will personally suck your dick and give you a high five at the same time https://www.change.org/p/college-employer-council-students-demand-a-tuition-refund-for-each-day-missed-in-case-of-an-ontario-college-strike/nftexp/ex15/v6/818679301?recruiter=818679301&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial.combo_new_control_progress_bar&utm_content=ex15%3Av6
Jed,Sign the Petition
Jed,College Employer Council: Students demand a tuition refund for each day missed in case of an Ontario college strike
Jed,damn they're on strike again?
Jed,"not as sure about college profs, but for uni and high school they have an insanely good setup"
Jed,"as in high pay, low hours, good benefits"
Jed,and they still strike
Jed,"the people a year older than me got screwed for uni applications cause the public school board teachers aren't legally allowed to strike, so the union just strongarmed all the teachers into stopping extracurriculars so basically everyone who was applying to post-secondary stuff had a big empty extracurricular section on all their applications"
Jed,the worst part is that most teachers didn't even want to do it but you can't teach in a public school without being part of the union so they had no choice
Jed,and the union's pretty screwed up even when no one's going on strike
Jed,"one of the major things is that your ability to get placed where you want is based 100% on seniority, so if you're an awful teacher who's been around for 30 years you can teach what you want, where you want, and if you're a brand new teacher living paycheck to paycheck you probably can't even get a job"
Jed,"one of my uncles has been a teacher for six years, he couldn't get a job for the first three years except as a substitute teacher or an LTO (long term occasional, basically if a teacher goes on maternity or sick leave for awhile he would come in and pick up a poorly documented class for a few months then he'd be out of a job again), then he got a really good slot for a year.... only to get kicked out by someone with more seniority and he had to spend the next two years at a place for kids who've been expelled or are in juvie but can't technically not get school (read: everyone's an asshole and/or doesn't give a fuck and it's in the middle of a super dangerous area) before he's finally managed to get a decent placement and who knows how long that's gonna last, cause based on their system by the end of the year he'll only have 4 years of seniority"
Jed,Teachers unions are just terrible
Jed,Looks like we agree on one more thing
Jed,"some unions are alright, especially in dangerous jobs (like factory work), but a) unions in public funded areas are generally terrible cause they're fairly essential services where it has a large, negative impact on society if and when they strike, b) teachers already have a pretty damn cushy gig and really, really don't need a union, and c) this union in particular has a tendancy to kinda sorta work against the best interests of its members in an attempt to make things marginally better for a small handful of them"
Jed,holy shit
Jed,I leave this chat for a couple weeks and come back to find deep discussion on politics
Jed,nice
Jed,Welcome back
Jed,hey boys
Jed,yee
Jed,@Max

Jed,Its going good
Jed,Is there a new build I could play tonight?
Jed,ooh ooh play with me later
Jed,I was planning on patching it soon
Jed,maybe I can get the new build together today
Jed,yes @Sak von Sak
Jed,I can't now tho
Jed,just took an hour-long melee break
Jed,and I've got a midterm at 7
Jed,is anyone here getting destiny 2? It looks kinda gay but im down if you guys get it
Jed,oh
Jed,rip
Jed,how difficult are exams?
Jed,also @Max @Sak von Sak college life is crazy
Jed,gotta love it though
Jed,I just took a midterm and it was pretty easy
Jed,"I'm not that worried, I've done a ton of old midterms and I basically know every questions he's gonna throw at me"
Jed,we're allowed a cheat sheet too
Jed,thats OP
Jed,I want a cheat sheet
Jed,honestly I'm usually more worried about tests where they let you have a cheat sheet
Jed,cause that means it's hard
Jed,true
Jed,"and it's gonna be more questions testing your understanding and application than your knowledge, which is really all the cheat sheet helps with"
Jed,I got a cheat sheet for my math midterm and I didn't even need it
Jed,@Trapezoider Even if I don't make a new build today the build we are on will be new for you
Jed,@Trapezoider you should get a copy of the cards and make a few decks before we play
Jed,I sent him the pdf
Jed,"just to warn him tho, there's a few cards with two versions in the pdf (at least if it's the same one I've got) and a bunch of unimplemented/banned cards"
Jed,woah
Jed,"from what I remember, knight, scholar, goblin, and berserker are banned atm due to being more than a little OP, there's two versions of stasis chamber (I think the actual one is the one with 1 attack), two grand arbiters (3-cost one is the real one), wild magic is banned, power cultivation might be banned, replicator is banned or at the very least it's getting removed next patch, time walk shouldn't exist anymore, and once there stop being pictures for stuff everything unimplemented"
Jed,at least in my version
Jed,Power cultivation isn't banned
Jed,He has the same version as you @Sak von Sak
Jed,oh I thought it was
Jed,my bad
Jed,Tonights games will probably be the final testing before 1.18 is implemented
Jed,I found another good wrastor
Jed,he wrecked me the first few games but I brought it back
Jed,The mythical good wrastor player
Jed,many deny the very existence of such a player
Jed,@Sak von Sak @Trapezoider @me when you want to play MCG and I'll set up the server
Jed,"I just finished my midterm, I'm gonna get a pizza (which will put me over budget for the week but fuck it I deserve a pizza) and then I'm down to play"
Jed,"it won't actually put me much over budget cause pizza pizza has a clutch deal - large pizza, 3 toppings, dipping sauce, $13 including tax"
Jed,and I can just bring the couple of leftover slices for lunch tomorrow and save some there
Jed,pizza pizza coming in clutch
Jed,@Trapezoider fight me mcg
Jed,@Trapezoider you're letting me down
Jed,@here games?
Jed,I'm waiting on @Trapezoider to come play mcg with me

Jed,@Sak von Sak I think I've figured out a better way to deal with your trap from yesterday
Jed,there's a lot of good ways around it
Jed,but even if you block it I force you to waste a turn blocking it
Jed,and I get at least a knight and a bishop out
Jed,Raven ate the entire stem off of one of our pumpkins lol
Jed,Eww
Jed,Why did you just call her Raven?
Jed,ha
Jed,thats my dog's name
Jed,Oh
Jed,No that's Ava
Jed,Stop lying
Jed,I didn't mean Ava if some of you thought that
Jed,We all know she craves pumpkin stems
Jed,I totally thought you meant Ava
Jed,lololol
Jed,Yeah me too
Jed,I was pretty sure you meant ava
Jed,did ava name herself after the dog or the dog after ava?
Jed,Ava named her online alias after the dog

Jed,God bless my architecture prof and his wonderful curves
Jed,I live to study another day
Jed,"I finally finished persona 5 last night, man that was a game"
Jed,"Indeed, it is a game"
Jed,"I'm still cracking up that I told kameron I was halfway through the final boss at around 830, which was 100% true, and the game wasn't actually over until 11"
Jed,game's ending was longer than most movies
Jed,and it made me feel a lot of things
Jed,That's like the ending of Pokemon sun and moon
Jed,most of them good
Jed,I hate it when you think you are gonna beat a game
Jed,Then the ending takes a million hours
Jed,And you end up staying up all night
Jed,god the ending was so good though
Jed,@undertale
Jed,I wouldn't have cut any of it out
Jed,It's like 30+ minutes of unskipable cutscenes
Jed,this was about two hours
Jed,two glorious hours
Jed,What game is it sylki?
Jed,Nice
Jed,scroll up a wee bit
Jed,you'll see
Jed,Persona 5 you drunk
Jed,Sorry
Jed,I was thinking about rough completion times for most rpgs
Jed,and it's like
Jed,pokemon: 20-30 hours
Jed,chrono trigger: 30-35
Jed,chrono cross: 50ish
Jed,@bois I'm becoming a PI today. Get to go investigate a sketchy corp and acquire police reports and records from the capitol of my state
Jed,xenobladeX: 65
Jed,persona 3: 75
Jed,@wolfstein 20
Jed,xenoblade: 80
Jed,"persona 5, according to my game file, 94 hours"
Jed,that is insane
Jed,Those are looking like my CSGO hours
Jed,Except mine are like +60
Jed,So
Jed,Not that close actually
Jed,"at least on steam, the only games I've played more than 94 hours are tf2, csgo, and rivals"
Jed,"seriously though, incredible game"
Jed,and all I want to do is start again
Jed,try and get all the stuff I missed
Jed,WHOS HYPED FOR NEW WOLFENSTEIN
Jed,I didn't play the first one
Jed,there's a whole bunch
Jed,Oh
Jed,I've played none of them
Jed,I have also played none of them
Jed,"one of my favourite things about studying is coming up with really, really shitty acronyms for things, only for them to actually be useful if only because I'm amused by how terrible they are"
Jed,I sometimes make acronyms too
Jed,"current highlights are SDVE (pronounced like ""Steve""), and SCURP (which is just fun to say)"
Jed,bonus points to myself for figuring out the Steve thing cause the acronym has to be in that order
Jed,nice
Jed,@Rivals of Aether @Cs:go games?
Jed,fuuuuck I missed it
Jed,"m2k's in toronto for canada cup, showed up to a weekly"
Jed,grands was poop m2k

Jed,why am I like this
Jed,yur dumb
Jed,"it's like, five or six hours in a nearly hundred hour game is not all that long, and when's the next time I'm gonna have the opportunity to a) choose first and last name for a characters, and b) have the name 'Locke' be thematically appropriate?"
Jed,"I'm not gonna do it, cause those five or six wasted hours aren't worth the shitty joke"
Jed,I'll save it for if I ever run a rogue in D&D
Jed,"lol ""Guys, the audio seems delayed because light travels faster than sound. The stream is coming from Canada so the difference in speed is magnified."""
Jed,real talk the canada cup stream is messed up in so many ways right now
Jed,"the game audio was a good five seconds delayed for awhile, they also messed up the overlay so the sidese of the game video don't match up with the sides of the box alotted to it"

Jed,that was sick
Jed,and n0ne's playing crazy too
Jed,but he's against armada so he's still losing
Jed,he's moving tho
Jed,that was depressing
Jed,n0ne's offense was incredible
Jed,but armada's defense was even better
Jed,"like n0ne was moving insanely fast and getting really neat followups but anything that wasn't 100% guarunteed just wasn't hitting, ever"
Jed,"welp kage's getting m2k, rip canada"
Jed,@here games?
Jed,
Jed,essential if youère gonna be in this server
Jed,heh
Jed,I mean
Jed,okay
Jed,"they need to include some mix of @ here and the tags, so you can @ here + a specific game tag"

Jed,is that better @Eric Working From Home
Jed,you didn't give it to yourself lol
Jed,I gave it to him
Jed,oops
Jed,so uh games or what?
Jed,watching canada cup
Jed,poor kage's got his third straight sheik after this
Jed,did he play gay sheiks before?
Jed,kirbykaze then android
Jed,"3-1, 3-1"
Jed,but now he's got m2k
Jed,who is a very different beast
Jed,Did you not get his joke?
Jed,prolly ignored cause it was a dumb joke
Jed,oh lol
Jed,that took me a few seconds
Jed,my god they're both nuts
Jed,that was way closer than I was expecting
Jed,"and then n0ne just kinda goes ""oh shit it's game five last stock, better turn up"""
Jed,honestly kage did better than I expected
Jed,lolol they're singing him happy birthday
Jed,"well top 4 is gonna be hype : armada, leffen, m2k, n0ne"
Jed,"lolol street fighter is doing crews, the grand finals is Team Japan 2 vs Team Japan 3"
Jed,"street fighter crews seem weird cause nothing carries over between matches, so it's entirely plausible to just send out your best player first and have them sweep the whole other crew"
Jed,rip n0ne
Jed,that poof kill was so sad
Jed,I'm personally glad to see m2k re-mastering his vs falcon game
Jed,"cause n0ne kept it even all the way till that, and was outplaying him after it, but he died at like 40% and he wasn't playing well enough to bring it all the way back"
Jed,I honestly don't feel like m2k was playing that particularly well
Jed,yo m2k with the quick classic - weak upsmash to tipper fsmash
Jed,Good to see the player I always copy copying me for once
Jed,yo that was awesome
Jed,M2K catches the close range stitch and kills armada with it
Jed,YESSSSSS
Jed,4th time
Jed,that was quite the pop off
Jed,first time ever in a game 5
Jed,he just vanished from the playercam for a good 5-10 seconds
Jed,I missed the stitch catch tho and that makes me sad
Jed,i dont think that there is any doubt now that hbox > armada
Jed,are leffen and plup gonna surpass the other 3 gods tho?
Jed,m2k pogchamp
Jed,m2k's feeling himself
Jed,hopefully he can keep it up for both sets
Jed,I think if he wins it would be his biggest win of all time
Jed,WHAT
Jed,THESE TECS
Jed,Repeat of the 6-0 meme?
Jed,OH MY GAWSH
Jed,HES CRAZY
Jed,He is definitely above plup this year if he wins
Jed,who?
Jed,m2k
Jed,leffen or m2k
Jed,possibly also leffen
Jed,"i mean, plup beat leffen like 4 times"
Jed,h2h doesn't really matter as much in melee
Jed,chu is up 4-1 vs m2k but no one says he should outrank him
Jed,this is true
Jed,good god m2k's going ham
Jed,60-40 XD
Jed,NA crowd
Jed,imo its 50-50
Jed,i know the crowd is chanting 60-40
Jed,it's weirdly stage dependant tho
Jed,yeah I heard
Jed,FD it's like 65-35 for marth
Jed,dream land 60-40 fox
Jed,"it seems like except for hbox, the top 6 is really a toss up right now"
Jed,m2k's going haaaaaaam
Jed,calm down m2k
Jed,Lets go 6-0
Jed,DAT UPSMASH THO
Jed,lol there's one guy cheering for leffen in the crowd
Jed,rip 6-0 dream
Jed,i cry 
Jed,bad melee

Jed,Was this the conservative girl?
Jed,well
Jed,politcally conservative yes
Jed,You know what I meant
Jed,yeah was clarifying
Jed,Welcome back
Jed,this was the girl who seemed kinda sketchy about the whole relationships thing?
Jed,she just kinda ignored me all the time
Jed,after I asked her out
Jed,"(on an unrelated note, someone in the crowd for sfv at canada cup has a massive sign that just says 'SORRY')"
Jed,yeah that seems like a good call
Jed,she didn't ignore me when I said we were done though
Jed,and she sent a snap of her drinking with some dude
Jed,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Jed,lol
Jed,Don't respond
Jed,FeelsBadMan
Jed,No
Jed,"I think that's supposed to be a ""I don't need you"" kinda thing"
Jed,That's what your supposed to feel
Jed,which is a massive dick move
Jed,but seeing as you kinda already figured she didn't give much of a fuck about you
Jed,hopefully it's not as bad
Jed,I know I made the right choice and had good reasons but I still feel bad
Jed,"not for her, just bad in general"
Jed,I know that feel
Jed,relationships are weird
Jed,^
Jed,akwardly sits with absolutely nothing to add
Jed,it's honestly made me kinda hesitant to try em out again
Jed,should probably try to get over that
Jed,"also max, you're at college give it a shot"
Jed,There is no one good
Jed,fair
Jed,I feel that
Jed,but you should at least try to make some friends
Jed,No one good... yet
Jed,there prolly is
Jed,you just always find the bad ones first
Jed,that's the best way to find people imo
Jed,damn apparently people sponsored by echo fox won all the smash events at canada cup

Jed,I think I successfully built the most defensive deck ever seen
Jed,"I won by wearing his health down one by one (eventually two by two and for the last few turns three by three) with swarm -_-
It wasn't supposed to be like that but the deck I was against prevented me from winning in any other manner"

Jed,"On a rainy morning in Tokyo, Takao Akizuki, an aspiring shoemaker, decides to skip class to sketch designs in a beautiful garden. This is where he meets Yukari Yukino, a beautiful yet mysterious woman, for the very first time. Offering to make her new shoes, Takao continues to meet with Yukari throughout the rainy season, and without even realizing it, the two are able to alleviate the worries hidden in their hearts just by being with each other. However, their personal struggles have not disappeared completely, and as the end of the rainy season approaches, their relationship will be put to the test. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Jed,"To the outside world, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are the perfect couple. But in reality, they just share the same secret pain: they are both in love with other people they cannot be with. Hanabi has loved her childhood friend and neighbor Narumi Kanai for as long as she can remember, so she is elated to discover that he is her new homeroom teacher. However, Narumi is soon noticed by the music teacher, Akane Minagawa, and a relationship begins to blossom between them, much to Hanabi's dismay. Mugi was tutored by Akane in middle school, and has been in love with her since then. Through a chance meeting in the hallway, he encounters Hanabi. As these two lonely souls spend more time together, they decide to use each other as a substitute for the one they truly love, sharing physical intimacy with one another in order to stave off their loneliness.

Jed,Ouran Koukou Host Club
Jed,"Haruhi Fujioka is a bright scholarship candidate with no rank or title to speak of—a rare species at Ouran High School, an elite academy for students of high pedigree. When she opens the door to Music Room #3 hoping to find a quiet place to study, Haruhi unexpectedly stumbles upon the Host Club. Led by the princely Tamaki, the club—whose other members include the ""Shadow King"" Kyouya, the mischievous Hitachiin twins, and the childlike Haninozuka ""Honey"" and his strong protector Mori—is where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls in the academy. In a frantic attempt to remove herself from the hosts, Haruhi ends up breaking a vase worth eight million yen and is forced into becoming the eccentric group's general errand boy to repay her enormous debt. However, thanks to her convincingly masculine appearance, her naturally genial disposition toward girls, and fascinating commoner status, she is soon promoted to full-time male host and plunged headlong into a glitzy whirlwind of elaborate cosplays, rich food, and exciting shenanigans that only the immensely wealthy Ouran Host Club can pull off.

Jed,Great Teacher Onizuka
Jed,"Onizuka is a reformed biker gang leader who has his sights set on an honorable new ambition: to become the world's greatest teacher... for the purpose of meeting sexy high school girls. Okay, so he's mostly reformed. However, strict administrators and a class of ruthless delinquents stand between Onizuka and his goal and they will use any means, however illegal or low, to drive the new teacher away. Perfect, because Onizuka's methods won't be found in any teaching manual; he cares about the difference between legal and illegal activities about as much as he cares for the age difference between himself and a high school girl. So get ready for math that doesn't add up, language you'd be slapped for using, and biology that would make a grown man blush... unless of course, you're the Great Teacher Onizuka.

Jed,@Sak von Sak rivals?

Jed,Soon
Jed,My car fishtailed and I flew into a freeway and got boned at the front of my car. I then proceeded to do a 360 then fly back into the exit
Jed,And block the lane
Jed,Just got home
Jed,I should be dead
Jed,But I drive a tank :)
Jed,snap dude
Jed,did your car get totaled?

Jed,I gotta bike now :)
Jed,Ye I'm just glad I'm alive kameron
Jed,@everyone in case I spontaneously die thank you all for imporving the quality of my life the last 2 years. You guys are great
Jed,fishtailed means that someone hit the back of your car right?
Jed,um
Jed,should we be worried?
Jed,he got in car crash
Jed,"I got that part, was mostly worried that there might be something in the aftermath"
Jed,but I guess he meant more in the general case of if he dies cause unforseen circumstances
Jed,Yes
Jed,not sudoku
Jed,I'm very aware right now. Of how fragile life is
Jed,@Sak von Sak have you been in a car crasherino?
Jed,I got hit by a bus while on my bike once
Jed,How did you not die.exe?
Jed,"and I distinctly remember falling towards the side/wheels, and thinking ""SHIT""  and then ""Come on man, if you die here, is that really the last thing you want to think?"""
Jed,Then what :0
Jed,and then some 30-120 second gap in my memory
Jed,next thing I remember is propped up against a building on the side of the road with all the people I was with gathered in a terrified semi-circle around me
Jed,and being sooooo deep in shock
Jed,We're you injured?
Jed,"I survived by not getting hit on, I swerved, my back wheel popped up and I spun into the side then fell off, then.... something"
Jed,"nothing serious, my knees have been even more screwey ever since"
Jed,"he ended up running over my bike, thought he'd run me over and was honestly the most relieved person in the whole event"
Jed,I still have the decimated bike seat
Jed,How long ago was this
Jed,"summer after grade 10, so.... 5 years ago?"

Jed,pubg?
Jed,Leffen got possibly the hardest bracket possible
Jed,yeah thats what the casters just said xd
Jed,Mango>Plup>Armada>Hbox
Jed,"bruh if leffen was on the other side of the bracket, then this would be ez tourney 4 plup"
Jed,now its ez tourney for hbox
Jed,unless big leff goes ham
Jed,but i dont think that plup can win the tourney anymore
Jed,Since leffen won't kill hbox for him?
Jed,ye
Jed,unless mango beats hbox in winners and big leff beats him in losers
Jed,but that prolly wont happen
Jed,ez 4 the box
Jed,"full predictions: hbox 3-0 SFAT, Mango 3-1 Axe, Armada 3-2 wizzy, plup 3-2 leff, hbox 3-1 mango, plup 3-2 armada, hbox 3-0 plup"
Jed,I think armada wizzy will be a 3-0
Jed,yeah you're prolly right
Jed,hbox 4-stock pogchamp
Jed,so much for the 3-0
Jed,3-2 ecksdee
Jed,but my preds are already wrong
Jed,i thought axe's yung link would beat mango's mario
Jed,but it didnt
Jed,you still have gotten set winners correct
Jed,^
Jed,lets go wizy
Jed,can he do it
Jed,hes going ham
Jed,but i have to root against him
Jed,I don't think plup beating armada was the streak being broken because plup was top 6 at then time
Jed,If wizy wins its truely over
Jed,Why do you need to root against wizy?
Jed,for da predictions
Jed,your predictions are not worth the hype of armada losing to a non top 6
Jed,maybe 3-0 at that
Jed,yeah but upsets are only interesting in the short term
Jed,I think if the armada slump continues he will retire
Jed,look at armada's face
Jed,he looks depressed
Jed,yeah
Jed,I think he is actually gonna cry
Jed,CHOKE
Jed,armada is back
Jed,rip the dream
Jed,NOOOOOOOOOOO
Jed,that ending
Jed,wizzy beat himself that set
Jed,alright time for the classic salty leff v plup
Jed,what happened? I missed the end
Jed,wizzy sd'd
Jed,aw
Jed,this match is lit
Jed,real lit
Jed,the plup samus coming out?
Jed,well rip
Jed,I'm going to be studying that game later
Jed,honestly it was a pretty questionable choice
Jed,the commentators weren't lying when they said it's her worst stage in the matchup
Jed,I know
Jed,FD is my ban
Jed,lets go leffen
Jed,From my experience Sheik is even worse on FD
Jed,sizable leff

Jed,cause you don't want any...
Jed,whenever someone leaves anything in the wahsre or dryer here it just ends up on the floor
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL
Jed,our floor is horrifyingly disgusting
Jed,cause our basement is just concrete and we never go down there expect to do laundry
Jed,and if I left it on the floor they'd have to clean it again and I'm not that heartless
Jed,"one time at my school I saw someone walk into the laundry room, take their load out of the washer, then found a dryer with the most amount of time on it. they just took out someone elses laundy and tossed it on the floor"
Jed,so they got a free dryer
Jed,that is amazing

Jed,I just found out that the lead singer of my favourite band has a chronic dissociative disorder that often makes him feel like he's just sort of watching his life in third person with no actual control over it
Jed,and it makes a lot of their lyrics make a lot more sense and also get way creepier in retrospect
Jed,they've got enough songs about losing control of your life and going crazy and killing yourself
Jed,sometimes all three at once

Jed,?
Jed,
Jed,@Bitmin lsd?
Jed,Nah
Jed,"I dont really know what hard drugs are, whats a DRUG?"
Jed,the only good experience I've had related to hard drugs is listening to a very drunk friend trying to describe what it's like to be on salvia
Jed,lol  sylki thinks salvia is a hard drug
Jed,i did salvia when i was 2
Jed,I mean from his description it sounded pretty insane
Jed,WHEN

Jed,Get it right
Jed,Also we are meeting at 8 dork not 7:50

Jed,@Homies Anyone up for L4D2?
Jed,"I wish, but I don't have the game. LOL"

Jed,sure why not
Jed,can confirm: drunk crew battles are the hypest shit on the planet
Jed,Is this IRL or on a stream?
Jed,irl
Jed,some of the worst melee you've ever seen
Jed,but hype as shit
Jed,I got the fastest semi-legit zero to death of my life
Jed,"start of match, got drill shined, tried to cc downsmash but his shine pushed me off stage so it got treated as buffered dair, but he messed up his waveshine and also went off stage, right into my dair and died from it"
Jed,also no one has any ability to maintain reasonable composure
Jed,a guy got in my head by talking about the midterm we both did earlier in the day
Jed,"""Yo what architecture style did you use? you'd better of used pipe & filter or you probably failed.""
""I didn't use pipe and filter""
""Damn son you are FUUUUUUCKED"""
Jed,missing one question means you fail?
Jed,100 mark test
Jed,66 mark question
Jed,I stand by my choice of style tho
Jed,is this the one where failing means you fail the course?
Jed,yeah
Jed,but I'm pretty sure implicit invocation will work jsut fine
Jed,so missing that one question will cost you the course
Jed,hypothetically
Jed,but there's a lot of bits
Jed,getting the wrong style won't make me fail
Jed,also I'm pretty sure my style is just as valid
Jed,if you care for a slightly more coherant answer ask me tomorrow
Jed,okay
Jed,"@Rotomotorz REMINDER IN CASE YOU MISSED MY FIRST MESSAGE: Andrew's address is 15631 Quince Trace Terrace, be there by 7:50"

Jed,i vote mrd
Jed,also there's not really a 'top' for this kind of thing
Jed,or dadlast
Jed,mrd tried to cheat in mcg yesterday
Jed,lawful good just means you follow a strict code of ethics that is generally good
Jed,"also my quote is wrong. It should be ironically ""My only goal in life is to respect all whamen"
Jed,more like put your dick in all of them  am I right
Jed,nah
Jed,that is not optimal
Jed,"I personally believe that the way I behave as a person makes be the best possible fit for lawful good, although I think my dad could fit it too, we just didn't put him on the chart because he isn't really a part of this server."
Jed,I'm with max on this one

Jed,as soon as I saw that there was an alignment chart the only two ones I knew for sure were max on lawful good and kameron on true neutral

Jed,you can buy that on steam
Jed,and I know we have the disc somewhere I just can't find it and I'm lazy
Jed,yeah I can
Jed,or he could not
Jed,but I already own the game
Jed,and save money on a game his dad owns
Jed,then go look for it
Jed,mighta got lost when we moved a couple years ago
Jed,lol rip
Jed,but if I already purchased the game once
Jed,is it wrong for me to download it somewhere else
Jed,I mean I would probably buy it since its really cheap but in this case I say do what you want
Jed,its $10
Jed,thats nothing
Jed,rich boi
Jed,yeah it is
Jed,$ 10 bucks
Jed,thats like a third tank of gas
Jed,I mean I'm not buying it again  just asking what you though
Jed,*1/4 a tank
Jed,not for meeeee
Jed,i fill up for 30
Jed,then you have a smaller tank
Jed,ye
Jed,but I can go a week+
Jed,so its guchi
Jed,"builds a new gaming pc to play good looking games, spends hours on a game from 2005"
Jed,is retarded
Jed,boys lets play some gaymes
Jed,isn't a mooch ;)
Jed,Pirates is a good game
Jed,
Jed,ooh but what do I name myself tho
Jed,also English ftw
Jed,My name will be Carl Okson
Jed,KArl
Jed,@Max
Jed,yeah?
Jed,I motion for an amendment of the allignment chart
Jed,"I say bitmin should be chaotic evil, and I should be neutral evil"
Jed,I suggested that but Ava insisted it stay how it is
Jed,Facsism is worse than ironically disrespecting whamen
Jed,"also he says ""kind of"" a facist"
Jed,I DID NOT
Jed,also its just a joke so it doesn't really matter
Jed,I'll change yours if you can come up with something better that still fits chaotic neutral
Jed,
Jed,Love this game
Jed,"How dare you attack English ships! For whatever reason, when I played that game I never attacked the English (I was English myself)."
Jed,I don't
Jed,oh is that your fleet?
Jed,Yes
Jed,rip
Jed,Glory to the crown
Jed,get to a port
Jed,Nah I had to divide the plunder
Jed,Am rebuolding
Jed,I'm already an English duke
Jed,nice
Jed,difficulty?
Jed,The third one up I think? I've been advancing each time I divide plunder
Jed,"If faschism were the measure for making someone ""evil"", which I don't think it is (but thats sorta besides the point), wouldent that be characterised closer to lawful ""evil"" rather than chaotic ""evil"" seeing as it usually leads to rules set in place that are very strict and follow a more lawful form of lifestyle or government(regardless of whether its better or not) rather than chaotic ?"
Jed,I agree with this reasoning
Jed,well since I'm lawful with the real law I get lawful evil
Jed,"lawful evil just means you follow a set of guidelines, not necessarily the law"
Jed,"a mass murderer who only kills blond men under 5'3"" is lawful evil"
Jed,a law-abiding asshole who's just generally a dick to everyone would not be lawful evil (probably neutral evil)
Jed,idk how much i agree with that
Jed,"having a standard for who you murder isnt exactly ""lawful"""
Jed,"among the two of us, I'm the one who's actually played D&D"
Jed,and has had the alignments explained in a lot of detail
Jed,"oh, does it?"
Jed,did not kn o w
Jed,well its too late and its a meme anyway
Jed,"lawful normally aligns with the law (particularly lawful good), but that's mainly due to the law being a pre-existing set of moral rules"
Jed,"chaotic generally is following your instincts for good/evil, not having a 'code' that you follow, and placing more value on an individual's choice"
Jed,the whole lawful vs chaotic thing can also be framed in terms of order vs freedom
Jed,
Jed,Facism as a social system has only brought suffering and death to the masses
Jed,"things I learned today: there is a toronto melee player whose tag is 'DACDACBRUCE', a tag that makes even less sense when you realize that his actual name is jonathan"
Jed,Guys it's cornpop
Jed,ew

Jed,and im like bruh why do i gotta Sim is its not like stat weights change from person to person
Jed,"and these mongs are like ""yeah that do"" like shit thought we were playing hte same class forgot blizzard made it so everyones class is different depending on whos playing it"
Jed,"and then later some guy in the discord got an achievement and i said Grats and these mongs are all like ""oh look whos back bet he wants to know the stat weights again"""
Jed,like these fucking monkeys
Jed,go play ret pally get off feral im surprised you even have the brain power to operate this spec

Jed,dw basically ret paladin is for braindead monkeys and feral is the hardest spec in the game to play
Jed,I understand nothing you just said
Jed,Stat whore
Jed,:p
Jed,bruh i jsut wanted to setup my pawn so it would tell me what gear is better
Jed,and in High level WoW raiding you gotta stat whore everything

Jed,Then we all get assigned someone
Jed,"Who we make a gift box for, for a set amount of money"
Jed,Then mail it off in time for Christmas
Jed,I'd be down

Jed,Ye me too. @Sak von Sak you in Philip medianson?
Jed,maybe
Jed,depends how many people we get
Jed,yee
Jed,"I'll ask Ava, max, doc, and chikonN tonight"

Jed,"get in here, we're starting"
Jed,kk gimme a sec
Jed,Salt has infused itself with my dna
Jed,
Jed,Fuck me 
Jed,That's your chance
Jed,slide into those DMs
Jed,No
Jed,Is this your ex or something?
Jed,no
Jed,here's the story
Jed,this chick on halloween was dared to kiss me during truth or dare
Jed,and she did and she was like apologizing a bunch about it bein awkward
Jed,and I was the one who was driving her home and so like in my car she was still talking about it XD and I said well oh we'll have to try it again sometime then
Jed,so after that we talk a lot over snapchat and hang out at school and stuff
Jed,and then 2 fridays ago we hung out outside of school and before I took her home we kinda just looked at each other and made out
Jed,so that was chill everything was good
Jed,after that we talked about where we were at and I said I wanted to go out with her but she said she wasn't ready for a relationship yet but that she wanted to date me
Jed,so i was like chill I can wait
Jed,fast forward to this last friday
Jed,was 10/10 stoned with trap and another friend
Jed,I was talking with her and sent a snap that said I really like you or something like that
Jed,and she responds with a long ass snap about how she isn't ready for a relationship and that she couldn't ever see us being more than friends
Jed,and then today she posted that
Jed,"also, saturday she went back to snapping me like we never even had the conversation"
Jed,idk lifes a bitch
Jed,"no, she is xd"
Jed,Women are weird sometimes my dude
Jed,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Jed,Yo
Jed,hit her up
Jed,be like
Jed,what's the deal
Jed,??
Jed,see if I do that she's gonna be all pissy and be like oh I thought you were more mature than that
Jed,I'm probably gonna end up doing that tho
Jed,haha true
Jed,we'll see how high I get
Jed,woah
Jed,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Jed,"Yo just man up, do it without the green"
Jed,I'm not sure if I want to lose the friendship tho
Jed,Idk man
Jed,Low-key wanna comment in her post like then just go get a boyfriend there are lots of guys it there right?
Jed,@The Rona is that roast good enough?
Jed,It's not terrible
Jed,Make sure that you have every word spelt correctly though if you do post that
Jed,
Jed,I feel like it's just passive aggressive enough to get away with
Jed,I'm bouta fuck myself over prolly but it's finr
Jed,Yeah who cares
Jed,The only reason that the friendship exists in the first place is because of romantic interest
Jed,"Without that, there's not really a point is there?"
Jed,I guess the eventual hopes of her liking me again is the main motive
Jed,"That's probably the hardest part, not gonna lie"
Jed,I'ma comment it
Jed,Whatever happens happens
Jed,I say go for it
Jed,She could either see it as funny and hit you up or see you as a dick
Jed,So
Jed,It's done
Jed,It's whatever
Jed,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Jed,Life goes on
Jed,haha
Jed,C'est la vie
Jed,Lmao the response is already in 
Jed,No way
Jed,"""I don't appreciate your salty ass comment"""
Jed,I haven't opened it yet but that's what it says
Jed,Did she dm that to you?
Jed,Yeah over snap
Jed,How do you know what it says??
Jed,Gonna bring up not ready for a relationship probably
Jed,If you don't slide it all the way you can read the right most text
Jed,I see
Jed,"It would have been kinda funny if you commented ""Sorry, I'm not ready for a relationship"" "
Jed,Yours was better though
Jed,Yeah
Jed,Damn she's gonna block me from her sinsta
Jed,Rip
Jed,Oh well
Jed,At least my music is lit
Jed,people who block over stupid things are honestly the worst
Jed,But she is the best
Jed,;~;
Jed,Okay but she probably isn't the best but for some reason I think she is and I feel like doing dumb shit like commenting will make her not be my friend anymore
Jed,And maybe I will stop being obsessed with her if I have a reason to be angry at her
Jed,Jed
Jed,This is what dating Hatcher felt like. Don't get cucked buddy. She may seem like the best thing on Earth right now. But she's being a huge jerk. Stand up for yourself and don't take shit from anyone
Jed,"Yeah, if she acts this petty over one little comment, she ain't worth your time"
Jed,Please help save net neutrality https://www.battleforthenet.com
Jed,Comcast wants to control what you do online. Do you want to let them?

Jed,I'm on episode 7
Jed,"While doing research for an essay I'm writing, I came across an idea which is so simple yet I believe could revolutionize the way our government works and I had to share it. What if we made all political donations fully anonymous. If you want to see the full article, PM me with your email addess and I'll send it to you."
Jed,Wow that sounds like a great idea
Jed,why can't you just link the article
Jed,@foreinggovernmentswhowoulddonatebillionstofundnationalpolicythrouhgcandtidatestheyliked
Jed,its on a scholarly database which is restricted
Jed,"basic reasoning behind why that doesn't work is the 'anonymous' bit - the politician just sees the money, not who its from or any messages"
Jed,Can you give me the rundown of how this would affect the government?
Jed,and anyone could claim to have been the donator and there's no real way to prove who it actually was
Jed,helps stop people from giving politicians monetary incentive to support or oppose legislature
Jed,"don't feel like rewriting the article or debating it rn, just PM me your email if you want it"
Jed,"Send me the article max and I will see if I agree with this.. It sounds like an interesting notion, although my natural reaction is to oppose this."
Jed,I will read it tomorrow
Jed,I NEED YOUR EMAIL FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME
Jed,You have my email dork from google docs
Jed,On all the stuff we have collaborated on
Jed,andrewjp42@gmail.com
Jed,Like atlanta docs last year
Jed,also is atlanta 2.0 still on?
Jed,it would be DC
Jed,when?
Jed,summer 2018
Jed,no more detail currently
Jed,@Mr. Airplanes house?
Jed,thats the goal
Jed,okay
Jed,keep me informed
Jed,I need to procure certain amounts of funds into my savings account
Jed,yeah cause I need to start looking at costs now
Jed,@Mr. Airplane
Jed,make us some waffles
Jed,please
Jed,❤
Jed,pancakes are better
Jed,@Mr. Airplane make us pancakes instead
Jed,proper waffles are better imo
Jed,FALSE
Jed,they hold toppings way better
Jed,I'm more into crepes
Jed,#teampancake
Jed,waffles are superior
Jed,crepes are pretty damn good
Jed,@Sak von Sak dont let them decieve you
Jed,#team crepes
Jed,waffles are good but theres nothing better than a big fluffy sweet pancake
Jed,but in the waffles vs pancakes debate waffles are clearly superior
Jed,n0
Jed,yes
Jed,waffles >= crepes > pancakes
Jed,"but like,,"
Jed,you cant cook things into waffles
Jed,"@Trapezoider We have not had a proper conversation on meaningful topics in a long time, you should join up discord for games/discussion more often."
Jed,yeah you totally can
Jed,itll be all burnt n gross
Jed,http://www.strawpoll.me/14455790
Jed,Which is better?
Jed,Vote Now! [Waffles] [Pancakes]
Jed,never happened to me
Jed,
Jed,I prefer to eat lunch food anyways
Jed,@Max
Jed,pancakes have superior texture and flavor
Jed,I concur
Jed,not a fan of breakfast food
Jed,false
Jed,PICK ONE THO MAX
Jed,flavour? they're like 99% the exact same ingredients
Jed,Can we objecitvely prove which is better?
Jed,pancakes
Jed,OH SHIT FAMILY BETRAYAL
Jed,if we are talking highest quality waffles vs. highest quality pancakes waffles take it
Jed,i mean I guess but theres something about waffles thats kinda off putting
Jed,me and ava both chose pancakes
Jed,like theres a flavor there thats just  ? ? ?
Jed,eh
Jed,oh whoops
Jed,how do i describe it
Jed,"the only thing offputting about waffles is how much better they are than pancakes, given that they're the exact same thing cooked in a slightly different manner"
Jed,DIE
Jed,FALSE
Jed,they're like weirdly more bitter
Jed,nah
Jed,dude
Jed,maybe because theyre cooked more harshly
Jed,then you're just screwing up your pancake making
Jed,like who even cares to debate something as meaningless as this
Jed,like everyone in this discord
Jed,wait how? I want my pancakes to be sweeter
Jed,waffles with strawberry compote is the best way to wake up on a saturday
Jed,also I take my food very seriously
Jed,this is serious business!!
Jed,I have trash taste in food so I just eat what I like and keep to myself
Jed,"waffles with strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream, and maple syrup (like actual maple syrup, not whatever weird shenanagins like corn syrup that you guys have in the states) is honestly unbelievably good"
Jed,all that with pancakes instead of waffles is better imo
Jed,I guess we'll have to agree to disagree
Jed,naw cause with pancakes all the syrup and stuff doesn't stay on
Jed,I am a fan of fruit syrups personally
Jed,I mean don't get me wrong maple syrup is still hella good
Jed,pancakes soak up syrup better
Jed,"fruit syrup's alright, but it's not as good as actual maple syrup"
Jed,you can mix 'em and get some good combinations tho
Jed,truth
Jed,waffles soaked in syrup are a weird combo of hard and squishy
Jed,pancakes are soft and nice
Jed,
Jed,why is that a video XD
Jed,why did you make me download that
Jed,eat my waffles filled bootyhole
Jed,@HalfCentaur
Jed,@Trapezoider plane tickets are 358 round trip to dc
Jed,kk
Jed,can u afford
Jed,that will go down after holidays?
Jed,I mean
Jed,probably not
Jed,plane ticket prices can vary greatly over time so be sure to keep checking
Jed,they might be jacking up all prices since its around holidays
Jed,also tristan
Jed,can prolly hook us up with good deals
Jed,I looked at dates in the summer tho
Jed,if you book farther in advance itll be cheaper I think
Jed,they can't do that right now though since we don't know when it'll be
Jed,"His mother is a flight attendant, and is allegedly able to secure cheap flights regularly"
Jed,yeah

Jed,It all makes sense
Jed,never has a steam game taken so long to allocate disk space
Jed,Kameron can afford a bunch of couches because he sells drugs
Jed,"Oh no, I've been found out"
Jed,Gotta move to South America now
Jed,actually I think you've mixed up cause and effect - he has to afford all the couches to store his drugs
Jed,Check out your supply?
Jed,"Kameron, take me with you"
Jed,Going to Columbia?
Jed,yo why the fuck did it have to allocate 50 gigs if the game is actually only 26.6gb?
Jed,@Sak von Sak let me know if the game is good

Jed,@Trapezoider Are you going to want to melee soon?
Jed,@Max @Jed @The Rona csgo in 15?
Jed,I'll play
Jed,is fusion going to play to make it 5?
Jed,yeah
Jed,@Trapezoider csgo with us?
Jed,@The Rona where you at
Jed,welp
Jed,my thermostat is broken again
Jed,rip
Jed,sad
Jed,fucking thing lasted like two weeks
Jed,warranty?
Jed,"leading me to assume that it's either a) a faulty model in general, or b) something wacky's going on with the electricity through that particular bit that's causing the thermostat to keep fucking up"
Jed,it's all handled and paid for by my landlord
Jed,cause the lease more or less legally compels him to give us a functioning house
Jed,"on an unrelated note, I think I might have gotten weirdly good at sm4sh falcon"
Jed,that or the fact that me and the guy I was playing had a combined seven hours of sleep made everything dumb work
Jed,@max
Jed,@Max
Jed,yeah?
Jed,Smash?
Jed,@Sak von Sak you mean your sleep + his sleep was 7 hours?
Jed,yes
Jed,yup
Jed,I had three hours he had four
Jed,K finishing one more run through of moonlight sonata third movement then running upstairs
Jed,3.5 mins
Jed,when is your crew battle thing sylki?
Jed,over
Jed,we didn't get anything on stream
Jed,how did it go?
Jed,which I'm super grateful for because I played like a rusty trash can
Jed,we went 0-2
Jed,but we still go the next round cause top 4 teams make it out and there were only 4 teams
Jed,so I've got time to remember how to play the game
Jed,so hopefully next time I don't lose six stocks and only take three
Jed,double elimination crews are weird
Jed,especially cause there was a grand finals reset
Jed,so it was like an hour and a half long
Jed,"melee crews were hype tho, unfortunately we didn't have a crew cause we couldn't get enough interest "
Jed,but I got to watch one crew's anchor take 12 stocks (that I saw) and lose the battle by one stock
Jed,Good luck next round!
Jed,our second match was kinda funny cause we lost by one stock and every single member of our crew is blaming themselves for not getting one more stock
Jed,"""I had a good read on him but I let him get too much of a lead early on""
""I misinput a kill throw and dropped a stock cause of it and then my next game forgot how to fight ryu until I was already on last stock at death percent""
""I went too deep when I was making a comeback and could have taken that last stock""
""I SD'd at under 50% when the other guy was last stock at 130%""
""I choked under the last stock pressure, the full knees weak arms heavy mom's spaghetti experience"""
Jed,which one is you?
Jed,the second
Jed,"although in afterthough I actually messed up the order, second and third should be swapped"
Jed,my back throw that was supposed to be upthrow was on the last stock of the almost comeback

Jed,"When an Emishi village is attacked by a fierce demon boar, the young prince Ashitaka puts his life at stake to defend his tribe. With its dying breath, the beast curses the prince's arm, granting him demonic powers while gradually siphoning his life away. Instructed by the village elders to travel westward for a cure, Ashitaka arrives at Tatara, the Iron Town, where he finds himself embroiled in a fierce conflict: Lady Eboshi of Tatara, promoting constant deforestation, stands against Princess San and the sacred spirits of the forest, who are furious at the destruction brought by the humans. As the opposing forces of nature and mankind begin to clash in a desperate struggle for survival, Ashitaka attempts to seek harmony between the two, all the while battling the latent demon inside of him. Princess Mononoke is a tale depicting the connection of technology and nature, while showing the path to harmony that could be achieved by mutual acceptance. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Jed,oh my b @Mr. Airplane thought you were trap
Jed,Why does who it is matter?
Jed,cause trap told his mom
Jed,Did you get in trouble?
Jed,did I get in fucking trouble
Jed,lmao
Jed,is that a question
Jed,"Yo, that's actually dick"
Jed,I'm going to counselling now no phone no car
Jed,prolly transfering schools
Jed,rip dc?
Jed,and on top of that my parents told my little brothers that I was making bad choices and my brother asked if I was gonna kill him
Jed,idk
Jed,we'll see if I'm even around then
Jed,don't kill yourself
Jed,you should become a therapist max
Jed,"I'm to brutally honest for that, I would be a much better life coach."
Jed,WHOOSH
Jed,ya know what that is
Jed,@Trapezoider what the fuck man
Jed,thats the sound the joke makes as it goes right over your head
Jed,wait hold up @The Chief Apple what happened dude
Jed,parents found my shit
Jed,did trap intentionally get you in trouble?
Jed,idk all I know is he told his mom that he smoked with me
Jed,snap dude
Jed,and that I peer pressured him  into it
Jed,atleast thats what I heard
Jed,so whats happening with your parents then?
Jed,idk man
Jed,no car
Jed,phone is being watched
Jed,counseling
Jed,and they might try to make me quit my job
Jed,geez
Jed,yeet
Jed,love my family
Jed,that sucks dude
Jed,my brother asking if I was gonna kill him is the worst part
Jed,like fuck
Jed,I'ma take a long walk tonight and see where I'm at
Jed,hopefully everything works out ok my dude
Jed,we'll see
Jed,oh yeah
Jed,I am probably getting transferred back to my old school at some point too
Jed,they almost called the police instead of talking to me about it too
Jed,well at least they didn't do that
Jed,they threatened that if I don't do exactly what they say they still will get police involved
Jed,so I have that hanging over me
Jed,which is nice
Jed,That's honestly stupid
Jed,Not gonna lie
Jed,I dont understand how parents can say something like that
Jed,you right
Jed,I mean you're their kid
Jed,so hey anyone have an extra bed 
Jed,do they not realize how that makes somebody feel?
Jed,but like real shit even ignoring the fact that you're their son who the fuck calls the police on someone for smoking weed
Jed,true
Jed,ESPECIALLY if they're your kid tho
Jed,well obv
Jed,"just got caught up on this, seems pretty dumb"
Jed,I mean I knew the risk
Jed,but still
Jed,they're still overreacting
Jed,it seems like they're handling this poorly
Jed,^understatement of the day^
Jed,what is the right way to handle something like this then?
Jed,oh shit man you smoke weed
Jed,like dont
Jed,^
Jed,"some things they did wasn't unreasonable, but transferring schools is hella dumb"
Jed,give an ultimatum before going all in on the reform
Jed,"I mean, yeah octo's parents are going super far but I don't think just saying ""don't do that"" is going to change anything"
Jed,"you don't decide someone's making bad life decisions, don't force them into worse places"
Jed,help them get somewhere better
Jed,well i mean its not like hes making terrible life choices that will ruin his future forever
Jed,"like ""if you CONTINUE to do this then we'll make you move schools"""
Jed,smoking weed is pretty lax
Jed,was talking from his parents' perspective
Jed,yeah but it is illegal at his age so its not a great idea
Jed,I mean there is no ultimatum
Jed,its all of the above
Jed,"no car, quit your job, go to counseling, possibly switch schools"
Jed,the parts of that that are at least partially reasonable - counselling
Jed,not really anything else
Jed,that quit your job part like what is that supposed to accomplish
Jed,unless it's their car that they're letting you use
Jed,but not any counseling
Jed,Christian counseling
Jed,I think it's so he doesn't have money to buy weed -_-
Jed,oh lord jesus
Jed,save that for the christian counseling jed
Jed,but like... a major part of traditional rehabilitation for stuff like this is to get a job so you become a productive person
Jed,^^^^^^^^^
Jed,but thats the thing
Jed,I smoke
Jed,but I am also a very productive highschooler
Jed,I have good grades
Jed,and a job
Jed,"""hey you seem like a really good kid, lets change that so that you stop smoking"""
Jed,yup
Jed,like literally taking away everything I've worked to get my life in a decent place
Jed,gone
Jed,my advice would be to wait till they've cooled off a bit and then talk to them about it in this context
Jed,there is no talking to them
Jed,my parents are close minded retards
Jed,you'll probably have to take some other punishment but if you can keep the stuff that makes your life better it's worth it
Jed,my life was kinda already shitty before this
Jed,now there isn't gonna be really anything
Jed,fuck
Jed,I dunno what to say man
Jed,
Jed,how would switching your school even help the issue?
Jed,"if they do force you into counselling talk to your counsellor about this stuff, if you can convince them that moving schools and making you quit is bad, they might be able to get your parents to back off a little"
Jed,^ the counselling part might be a blessing not a curse
Jed,just try not to see them as the enemy even if they're trying to make you a perfect little christian
Jed,fuck counseling
Jed,they've tried to make me go before
Jed,try to get the counsellor on your side for this
Jed,if you treat him like trash he'll just tell your parents you're an incorrigible shit and they'll punish you more
Jed,there is literally nothing more they can do to punish me
Jed,they've listed literally everything I enjoy or do
Jed,well if it can't get worse why not try to make things slightly less bad
Jed,I guess except for my pc
Jed,idk
Jed,it literally cannot hurt you
Jed,I wholeheartedly agree with sylki
Jed,yeah you guys are prolly right I'm just still pissed
Jed,fuck I was gonna study for the SAT tonight
Jed,go for that walk
Jed,oh well
Jed,walks are nice
Jed,I can't
Jed,walk around the house if you have to
Jed,I have to wait for everyone to0 go to bed cause I'm on house arrest
Jed,pace the house if you must
Jed,moving helps calm down
Jed,and at worse it's a passive agressive way to keep your parents awake
Jed,although that might not be a good thing

Jed,derp
Jed,"another contender for best clip (can't find it tho) is that time ice waveshined armada all the way across battlefield and back, then armada hit him with one downsmash and it put them back at even percents"
Jed,my favorite falco clip https://youtu.be/Jl4KkCyVFNo?t=11m8s
Jed,"Top 10 ""Armada Getting Rekt"" Moments"
Jed,"Includes notable set losses or memorable ""bodied"" moments. The final clip was mislabeled. It is the #1 clip, not the #4 as it says. VOD Sources: 10. Armada v..."
Jed,But if I pass the assessment they can't offer me treatment so that's a plus
Jed,jed pass those assessments my dude can you still meme with us in voice channels or is that a no go

Jed,If I'm still having problems come morning I might stop by the drop in clinic on campus
Jed,But for now I'm 95% sure it's just the caffeine messing stuff up a bit coupled with the hyperawareness
Jed,"Cause it feeds on itself - I notice my heart rate increasing, stresses me out, heart rate increases more"

Jed,Wait really? Is he better than you now?
Jed,There's not really a lot of graphics in minesweeper
Jed,everything can just be drawn with code
Jed,What language are you doing this in ?
Jed,processing
Jed,I'm retarded and have never heard of that
Jed,Smh
Jed,Don't worry
Jed,no one has
Jed,Is it new?
Jed,Or SUPER old
Jed,Probably new-ish
Jed,What advantages does it have over other languages?
Jed,I couldn't tell you
Jed,:/ I think yours and other people's ability to program is so cool
Jed,It's super simple to learn
Jed,You guys are going to be the ones with all the power in this brave New world of ours
Jed,I always am so sloppy when I code. I make so many redundancies and no one understands what in doing because I get so disorganized
Jed,What course is mine sweeper for ?
Jed,My intro to computer programming course
Jed,This is my final project
Jed,Are you majoring comp sci?

Jed,"@Trapezoider You are always interested in how people learn things so I thought I would share the order in which I learned things in melee (to the best of my memory).
1.    Pick a main (Marth)
2.    Learn basic tech and combos
3.    Switch mains (Sheik)
4.    Switch mains (Jigglypuff)
5.    Learn basic Fox tech
6.    Switch mains (Fox)
7.    Learn the Fox matchup
8.    Learn intermediate Fox tech
9.    Learn the Luigi matchup
(I believe I met you sometime around here)
10.    Acquire a secondary (Sheik)
11.    Learn the Marth matchup
12.    Learn the Sheik matchup
13.    Learn the Samus Matchup
14.    Learn Advanced Fox tech
15.    Acquire another secondary (Falco)
16.    Learn the Captain Falcon matchup
17.    Learn the Falco Matchup"

Even in sad songs it's hard to find songs where they're sung with as much emotion as this one (a lot of the time it's just a sad melody and instrumentals). For those of you who don't feel like listening through the whole thing, the best part is from around 2:30 onwards

Jed,as in its sick
Jed,sick = ill
Jed,does counting crows have any popular songs? cause I feel like I've heard of them before
Jed,I've probably brought them up a few times (they're one of my favourite bands)
Jed,I think I've heard of them too.
Jed,but their best known songs are probably Mr. Jones and Accidentally In Love (which was in one of the shrek movies)
Jed,I know them from Mr. Jones. My mom has played that song in the car so many times.
Jed,"Mr. Jones has over 147,000,000 plays on spotify so i guess you could say its popular "
Jed,oh damn lol
Jed,that's a lot

Jed,
Jed,"Sad Songs: Sullivan Street, The Long December, I Wish I Was a Girl, Goodnight L.A., Holiday in Spain, Black and Blue, Possibility Days, Raining in Baltimore (if you're in the mood for a song that's just straight up depressed)
Not Sad Songs (at least musically): Mr. Jones, Rain King, Murder of One, Come Around, Miami, Insignificant, Cowboys, Shallow Days, American Girls, Daylight Fading, Recovering the Satellites

If you like listening to albums, I haven't listened through all their stuff (hence how I just found Possibility Days), but here's a rough breakdown of the ones I do know:
August and Everything After - mostly sad songs/ballads, overall their best album, only one song on it I don't actively like (ghost train)
Hard Candy - more energetic/rock-like, still has some sad songs, but more songs I don't really like (good time, new frontier, carriage) , and apparently there's a deluxe version that has a few songs I haven't heard yet and I should probably check that out at some point. Probably my 2nd favourite overall.
Recovering the Satellites - chill rock, a lot of good songs but not many phenomenal ones. Third best.
Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings - starts out very heavy on a sort of heavy alt-rock sound that I don't really like, then it hits some good sad songs and then mellows out for the end. Each song is kinda hit-or-miss but there are some really good ones. Would be higher if it didn't have as many songs I don't like."

Jed,@Eric Working From Home
Jed,i have a secret project im going to show you tomorrow
Jed,
Jed,its not your dick is it
Jed,no
Jed,Alright @Trapezoider  and @Jed story update
Jed,I consulted my roommate about his thoughts on the matter
Jed,"and he was like if that is a dodge, that is the stupidest excuse of all time"
Jed,"So then she might actually be concussed, so to not seem like an ass I say I hope you feel better"
Jed,and if you still wanna study just message me
Jed,"She responded with ""Aight"""
Jed,bruh
Jed,it was a dodge
Jed,It was totally a dodge
Jed,SMH
Jed,Yee but like
Jed,Aight is a weak ass response
Jed,That's like the last excuse I would use
Jed,"I dont know dude, this isnt look good. Dont reach out to her for awhile though. When will you see her in person next ?"
Jed,idk
Jed,There's a chance that I see her on one of the exam days
Jed,If we are in the same room
Jed,if not will you prolly not sere her again?
Jed,She might be in one of the same classes as me next semester
Jed,ooh thats guch. I would try to interact as much as possible in person to judge where shes at
Jed,"With my response though, the ball is in her park"
Jed,So if she is interested at all she would probably message me to study
Jed,"If not, she doesn't message me and it's whatever"
Jed,I hope she does or else shes a huge dork
Jed,I don't really care considering I know next to nothing about her
Jed,but is she attractive?
Jed,Yeah
Jed,
Jed,"But if she's someone who's gonna dodge with an excuse like ""I got a concussion"" I probably don't wanna be with them"
Jed,It's like  the boy who cried wolf
Jed,White lies in the short term solve nothing
Jed,and only cause more pain
Jed,Good idea to stay away= from FOLKS LIKE THAT
Jed,@everyone
Jed,Any math studying tips?
Jed,If I do good on this final I have three weeks of bliss
Jed,Do practice problems
Jed,^
Jed,lots and lots of practice problems
Jed,that's my basic plan for my stats exam
Jed,I get an 8.5/11 sheet for notes
Jed,Should I just wright example problems on there too?
Jed,Or concepts
Jed,"put the formulas on it, and if there are practice exams that seem to have common questions right those down too"
Jed,math is for nerds anyways
Jed,Thanks sylki
Jed,And doctor
Jed,no problem
Jed,anything to procrastinate even more on my own studying
Jed,(that's a bit of an exagerration I've already studied a solid amount today and I feel pretty justified in taking the evening off)
Jed,I was gonna study like all day
Jed,But then I spent the whole morning finishing my shity paper
Jed,Because I literally FORGOT
Jed,But doctor is a god and he helped 
Jed,@Sak von Sak Do your math teachers ever default to weird examples?
Jed,Because whenever he talks about any type of regression he always does so in terms of frog populations over time
Jed,occasionally
Jed,mostly my stats teacher goes off on weird tangents
Jed,like the time he somehow ended up discussing how he'd much rather have a goat than a ferrari
Jed,why?
Jed,Is a goat better than a ferrari?
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,@Master Memers im never playing skyblock with @The Rona ever again

Jed,"I am very confused. So someone left a comment on a youtube album saying that the album stopped kids from becoming liberals by warning them about the dangers of the world becoming like the one in the album. But the album is about a world where all freedom of expression is basically banned, which kinda happens on both extreme ends of the political spectrum (either agressive safe spaces and everything censored to avoid offending people or on the other end the shutting down of people being some way that they don't like (like gay), and in general on the extremes of both sides just the shutdown of opposing opinions). Funnier still is that the band is a Canadian one so they're probably fairly left by default -_-"
Jed,"on top of which, this album (and a lot of their other stuff) are basically just about how important music is to society, which isn't a political statement in any way"
Jed,and I genuinely can't decide if the comment was a bait or not

Jed,Wait what was the previous chess ai
Jed,Was it deep blue?
Jed,Or was that the one from 1993
Jed,That beat kasperov
Jed,"Deep Blue was the first AI to take a match from a world champion (it beat kasparov). It did this in 1997. The current best chess engine (at least it was) is Stockfish. Google's new AI is called AlphaZero and it beat Stockfish in a 100 game match with 28 wins, 72 draws and 0 losses. It even won 3 games with black (which is very rare at engine level). AlphaZero achieved this after only 4 hours of learning and is likely the strongest chess entity to ever play the game."
Jed,How much training data did it have?
Jed,I love how they name their ai alpha (blank)
Jed,Alpha go
Jed,The go ai
Jed,And now alpha zero
Jed,But seriously how much training data have
Jed,And what was the capactiy of the agents housing?
Jed,Processing power*
Jed,@Trapezoider The only knowlege it had was the rules of the game and 4 hours of playing against itself.

Though Kane's friend and colleague Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and his mistress, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), shed fragments of light on Kane's life, the reporter fears he may never penetrate the mystery of the elusive man's final word, ""Rosebud."""

Jed,naw but like actually tho @Max @Jed @Sak von Sak
Jed,yes
Jed,I'm good basically whenever
Jed,I'm through with studying for the day
Jed,I'm not sure I want to play a rivals tourney
Jed,I'm just watching capcom cup atm and I can stop whenever
Jed,@Max why not
Jed,If I play I'm not going to go tryhard with mains
Jed,ok thats fine
Jed,but like why tho
Jed,I'm probably gonna etalus and ori only
Jed,I just don't have the motivation
Jed,motivation to play a video game
Jed,for fun
Jed,with your buds
Jed,to play well with wrastor i need to grind for awhile
Jed,oh ok
Jed,then don't play wrastor
Jed,^
Jed,that is my main
Jed,when I say no main I mean no wrastor
Jed,in all fairness you said mains
Jed,which means I probably won't play ori
Jed,he is also a character that needs practice to play well
Jed,i feel like if we do a tourney ill prolly get last
Jed,jed might win
Jed,if max isnt playing wrastor
Jed,nah max still beats me anyways
Jed,"I prolly wont be on till kinda late, like 10EST or later, will you guys still be here?"
Jed,yee
Jed,I'll be here
Jed,@Sak von Sak ?
Jed,I don't have to go to school tomorrow
Jed,I'll be there
Jed,I don't have anything tomorrow till like 130
Jed,noice
Jed,my sleep cycle is totally screwey tho
Jed,"couldn't fall asleep till 4am last night, woke up at 730, couldn't fall back asleep till 9, slept till like 1230"
Jed,thats me over the summer
Jed,damn I barely know street fighter but this is a hype tournament
Jed,I'm just gonna cheer for this one japanese dude who plays the only character I vaguely know how to play
Jed,I prolly won't be here till 8ish pst
Jed,im nto sure yet tho
Jed,jk ima be here
Jed,ha even armada's watching capcom cup
Jed,and he's cheering for the same guy as me
Jed,ha

Jed,OW?
Jed,yes
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,To return of the jedi
Jed,If you want to still
Jed,Sorry I was gone all day lol
Jed,Our man Devon can't watch tonight
Jed,
Jed,Tomorrow then?
Jed,I will be home at like 9 PST
Jed,Or we just watch anyways XDEEEEE
Jed,also @Homies I read something about a rivals tournament maybe?
Jed,"If there is a tourament, it will be late. Although late is relative and since you are PST it might not be that late for you."
Jed,kk
Jed,good god this tournament's hype
Jed,???
Jed,capcom cup
Jed,tis a street fighter tournament
Jed,like the biggest non-evo one of the year
Jed,LINK
Jed,https://www.twitch.tv/capcomfighters
Jed,CapcomFighters - Twitch
Jed,Capcom Cup Day 2 - Top 32 to Top 8
Jed,you just missed a nutty winner's finals
Jed,"@Rivals of Aether ill be there in 30, lets start the tourney then"
Jed,kk
Jed,kkk
Jed,kkkk
Jed,kkkkk
Jed,f
Jed,no
Jed,pay your respects man
Jed,street fighter looks so hard
Jed,apparently this is the easiest street fighter
Jed,they made a ton of stuff more lenient
Jed,ah
Jed,dude nemo tho
Jed,nemo's the guy I'm cheering for
Jed,due to having played like 15 minutes of urien once
Jed,I've only watched one but same
Jed,urien just seems cool
Jed,yee let's go nemo
Jed,This game looks so boring
Jed,huh
Jed,I think it looks pretty interesting
Jed,"but part of that is I probably have a bit of a better idea of what's going on (not by a ton, but somewhat)"
Jed,I've watched a lot of different traditional fighters and this one seems by far the least interesting.
Jed,it's not quite as crazy as a lot of them but it's way easier to tell what's going on
Jed,"imo my favourite one to watch is p4a, shame it's basically a dead game (they released a really good balance patch... only to the arcade version and so like half the community migrated and the other half couldn't and it killed the game for the most part)"
Jed,I'm so happy to have finally made some progress. I clapped so hard my hands now hurt.
Jed,(This is minesweeper for those who don't play)
Jed,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Jed,I'm gonna watch till the end of this set
Jed,which might be pretty fast
Jed,mmmk
Jed,@Trapezoider there is a losers bracket
Jed,why
Jed,smh
Jed,So you can have a second chance
Jed,@Homies R I V A L S O F A E T H E R I S A F U C K I N G G A Y A S S G A M E
Jed,no u
Jed,ur mum gay
Jed,no ur mum gay
Jed,@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Let me know who wins!
Jed,ur mum gay
Jed,@Max I won 3-2 3-1
Jed,Nice
Jed,I'm super happy cause it was a great set
Jed,but I'm still super salty
Jed,same
Jed,ugh one game I sd'd at like 5
Jed,fucking xxxswagdabkamxxx
Jed,and lost a really important game cause of it
Jed,@Max come play me
Jed,I don't want to
Jed,I only played the tourney as a favor I'm not really enjoying ROA right now
Jed,melee then?
Jed,in about 10 minutes
Jed,kk
Jed,you are boosted mans
Jed,I don't understand
Jed,I've lost 1 out of 10 ranked games
Jed,"@everyone finally finished putting together a rough outline of a tabletop rpg campaign (basically D&D, but not actually D&D), can I have a show of @me for a rough indication of numbers for who'd be interested? I'm either gonna start running it like, tomorrow evening or in the new year, haven't decided yet"
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,yes
Jed,@Sak von Sak I might be game
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,@Sak von Sak for kameron
Jed,hes down
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,can we start tomorrow? @Sak von Sak
Jed,probably yeah
Jed,sweet!
Jed,we got more people than I expected so I'm gonna have to tweak the fight I had planned
Jed,"but meh, it's fun to put characters together"
Jed,Now I've got to come up with a clever character that isn't just lawful good
Jed,tomorrow will probably be like two-ish hours of character creation
Jed,so you don't need a ton of premise
Jed,TWO HOURS???
Jed,yote
Jed,character creation takes ages
Jed,especially since you guys don't know the system or any of the charms (there are probably upwards of 100) which form the basis of your character
Jed,and from what I've found you'll probably get ideas for how you want your character to be as a person as you start putting them together as a bundle of stats and abilities
Jed,@Sak von Sak rivals?
Jed,naw
Jed,hands kinda hurt
Jed,com'on
Jed,nope
Jed,kk
Jed,thou shalt not tempt me
Jed,t h o u s h a l t n o t t e m p t
Jed,t h o u g h s h a l t u s e t h e s p a c e b a r
Jed,a l o t
Jed,How similar is the character creation to D&D?
Jed,ish
Jed,it's a bit more straightforward imo
Jed,there aren't clearly defined classes in the same way
Jed,"which is good and bad - good that I don't have to cover how to play different classes for each person who's playing, bad in that you have a ton of options no matter what"
Jed,"also there's fewer weird things with equipment and race, and there's no super complex classes where you're choosing religions and the associated weird benefits and stuff"
Jed,https://i.imgur.com/6LaF38R.png
Jed,silver snipers op
Jed,^
Jed,Where can I find a VOD of them?
Jed,They probably don't have one
Jed,"They might have played at Dreamhack though, idk"

Jed,yuri roughly average girl
Jed,@Feral Nebula Need backup
Jed,huh?
Jed,I'm in for sayori on monika
Jed,but honestly it's doki doki literature club the characters aren't that that deep
Jed,yuri is bAD
Jed,ffs someone play something where there is an actual valid best girl to be had
Jed,ddlc doesn't have the character depth to justify this much of a best girl fight
Jed,true
Jed,do I need the dlc?
Jed,
Jed,there's dlc?
Jed,I'm not arguing for the best. Just that Yuri was the worst by far.
Jed,Yeahi ts like 20
Jed,no you don't
Jed,let people have their opinions tho @ max
Jed,yeah you communist]
Jed,Yo im bout to get some cupcakes
Jed,from the literature club
Jed,why did you even decide to play it
Jed,because it looks cooL?
Jed,\
Jed,yeah but all of us played it a long time ago
Jed,cause he finished daddy dating simulator and needed a new on e:P
Jed,I didnt even know this game existed
Jed,That was probably during one of my long  frostbite hietus;s
Jed,oh right
Jed,Someone find an actualy dating sim so that we can actually have best girl arguments
Jed,katawa shoujo
Jed,go
Jed,No one has had a frostbite hiatus like me

Jed,no its hiatus
Jed,if I can convince everyone to play katawa shoujo I will
Jed,Hell yea
Jed,no lets play roblox
Jed,No meme
Jed,join up
Jed,no
Jed,its premise is incredibly alienating but it's incredibly good
Jed,it might sound cheesy but it literally changed me as a person
Jed,the only way you're getting me to play roblox is as a meme
Jed,Sylki plays dating sims???
Jed,just the one
Jed,It's the only way he can get women
Jed,wait you don't
Jed,?
Jed,gotta fill the void some how
Jed,and I only started it out of spite so that I could critique people who kept telling me to from a more informed perspective
Jed,and then somehow I actually ended up really liking it
Jed,LOL
Jed,gg
Jed,yeah hes not gay
Jed,hes a cool mans
Jed,@Sak von Sak dating sims are cool
Jed,in general I will disagree
Jed,because of how REALISTIC THEY ARE
Jed,-_-
Jed,
Jed,realistc?
Jed,its a meme
Jed,They arent
Jed,oh
Jed,no girls talk like that
Jed,obviously its fake
Jed,dating whamen is so much fucking work smh
Jed,wait you don't have every girl you mett flirt with you?
Jed,true tho
Jed,I'm sure not all women are difficult to deal with
Jed,@Jed I am becoming involentarily celobet

Jed,nyoom
Jed,nyoom
Jed,same
Jed,lol
Jed,"so I've been putting together one last character for day one of the campaign, I might not end up using them cause I kinda made them op as fuck"
Jed,they kinda got away from my original idea of a graceful grappler kind of a fighter
Jed,"she can grab you, do a genuinely unreasonable amount of damage, possibly freeze you for as many turns as she does damage, and then while you're frozen trap you in a bubble that will probably take at least two turns to break through even after you defrost"
Jed,what the fuck dude
Jed,Thats op
Jed,This man is a monster
Jed,"oh and she also has a pretty unreasonable amount of health and defense, a few skills that increase her defense even further, and a skill that can force you to ignore a squishy person until you deal with her"
Jed,which you're not gonna be able to cause she's tanky as fuck and is just gonna freeze you and trap you in bubbles
Jed,yo balance these mans
Jed,dont delete her
Jed,this lady's getting balanced
Jed,just tone down?
Jed,"I'm removing the tankiness and the forcing you to deal with her first, reducing her damage"
Jed,so now maybe she won't look like this
Jed,OH MY GOD
Jed,WHO IS THESE MANS
Jed,What is the setting for this campaign?
Jed,modern fantasy
Jed,im hyped
Jed,So I can be a school girl?
Jed,im actually hyped as fuck
Jed,can I be a columbine shooter?
Jed,:-:
Jed,probably not
Jed,k
Jed,also yes you can 100% be a schoolgirl
Jed,Sweet
Jed,k if theres a sschool girl
Jed,I might be a schoolgirl
Jed,when I played this I played a schoolgirl
Jed,there needs to be a school shooter
Jed,smh
Jed,we also had a hairy motherfucker in his midthirties who was kind of a pedo
Jed,it was hilarious
Jed,can I be a generic terrorist?
Jed,not really
Jed,uGHHH
Jed,you're kinda prevented from being all that evil by the premise of the game
Jed,you can only be a little evil
Jed,Can I be a terrorist whos suicide vest didnt detonate so now he just screams allah ackbar at everyone he meets?
Jed,please no
Jed,"although you could, with a bit of work, plausibly be a reusable suicide bomber"
Jed,it just wouldn't be practical
Jed,y e s
Jed,p l e a s e
Jed,Actually ima be a kekistan memer who lives in his moms basement
Jed,it's far easier to throw explosives or set traps than attach them to yourself
Jed,I do not condone this
Jed,cause you'd need at least one or two charms to make sure you don't die every time you blow yourself up
Jed,also you need to get the explosives from somewhere
Jed,yo this sounds complicated as fuck
Jed,yeah no shit being a reusable suicide bomber is complicated
Jed,
Jed,please let me do it
Jed,Trap
Jed,please
Jed,Please fucking let me be  a reusable suicide bomber
Jed,no\
Jed,T H I S I S M Y C A L L I N G N I B B A
Jed,sigh
Jed,"basic plan at this point is character creation -> test fight with a team I've put together -> tweaking your characters, so you can give it a shot"
Jed,y e s
Jed,TTHANK YOU
Jed,Thank you dungeon master
Jed,
Jed,"basic rule #1 of DMing: if it sounds dumb, and your player wants to try it, let them try. If it crashes and burns, you warned them. If it works, then it's fun."
Jed,My friend tried for like 10 minutes to tame a wolf in some cave
Jed,My other friend ended up killing in on purpose
Jed,yo sylki
Jed,Gotta be honest
Jed,never played dnd
Jed,Parents thought it was satanic 
Jed,lololol
Jed,"What, how?"
Jed,so this is gonna be me being fucking autisic and doing dumb shit
Jed,while everyone wrecks
Jed,I mean you can basically worship satan in traditional d&d
Jed,yee
Jed,I mean
Jed,my parents are super religious
Jed,you can
Jed,I wasnt allowed to play pokemon
Jed,because they thought it was satanic
Jed,my childhood was fucked
Jed,
Jed,woah woah you're parents are those people??
Jed,That's a feelsbad
Jed,ye
Jed,thats why crazy shit happens sometimes round here
Jed,"on an unrelated note, holy shit I just realized it's technically possible to have a character who, out-of-the-box after character creation, can summon and control thunderstorms"
Jed,@mycomputerbeingthrowninagarbagecaninasnowstorm
Jed,Dibs
Jed,dibs
Jed,they can't do... anything else
Jed,I already called it
Jed,bids
Jed,I'm gonna be a little school girl who controls the weather
Jed,i call shotgun
Jed,btw you can just... get that a little later
Jed,
Jed,it's not even all that good early game because your activation stats will be meh
Jed,yo do we get mounts?
Jed,?
Jed,do we get M O U N T S to increase movement?
Jed,Like could I theoretically ride a goat into battle
Jed,yes
Jed,FUCK YES
Jed,there's even a fighting style for mounted combat
Jed,I AM THE REUSABLE GOAT RIDING TERRORIST
Jed,your goat would die every time you detonated tho
Jed,how expensive are goats?
Jed,fucked if I know
Jed,I haven't looked into it
Jed,canI just keep buying more goats?
Jed,theoretically
Jed,CaN i have a swarm of goats follow me into battle?
Jed,like the zerg
Jed,but goats
Jed,I don't think they'd attack for you
Jed,I'd have to skim the rules and charms
Jed,Damn
Jed,see if there is a possess charm
Jed,so I could possess all the goats
Jed,but I'm probably gonna say no just cause that'd make combat a bitch
Jed,and the goats would all have to have their own turns
Jed,holy shit yeah
Jed,and it'd take forever
Jed,wouldnt we have to roll for every goat
Jed,Yeah
Jed,LOL
Jed,yes
Jed,not fun for the everyone else tho
Jed,OH MY GOD
Jed,"Sylki, I didnt realize how hype this game could be"
Jed,holy shit bois
Jed,"ok so there is in fact a charm called ""Tame the Savage Beast"" which lets you give animals commands"
Jed,it has an upgrade
Jed,oh god
Jed,swarming: can give orders to a whole swarm of creatures
Jed,although they have to be small
Jed,FUCK YESS
Jed,ie not goats
Jed,GOATS ARE SMALL
Jed,GOATS ARE SO SMALL
Jed,"this is like, small birds/insects/mice small"
Jed,
Jed,look how small these mans are
Jed,@Max brb replacing one of my existing characters with a recreation of Skitter
Jed,
Jed,these mans are so small
Jed,no
Jed,you can command a single goat
Jed,okay mans
Jed,Wait sylki
Jed,...
Jed,Is there a charm to miniaturize things?
Jed,
Jed,oh dear
Jed,lemme look
Jed,technically yes
Jed,applying it to goats would be unreasonably expensive
Jed,Don't feed him Sylki
Jed,he couldn't get all the bits necessary till late game
Jed,so I don't mind this one
Jed,"Can I be a really old wise wizard who, instead of dying, opted to transfer his soul into robot/new body (a kid)."
Jed,Sylki
Jed,I will make this dream happen
Jed,My imagination has been empowered
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,nope
Jed,rip the dream
Jed,you could be a wise old wizard who did die and was reborn and remembers his past life
Jed,omg
Jed,although it's kinda hard to wizard in this game
Jed,the traditional wizard-style stuff isn't super practical
Jed,I might add the remembers past life to a different class
Jed,I USED TO BE A KING
Jed,and stuff like that could be fun
Jed,I can't wait to see how your king interacts with trap's lunatic miniature goat herder
Jed,yes this will be interesting
Jed,And my Schoolgirl
Jed,
Jed,Who may or may not be controlling the weather
Jed,The king demands it stops raining
Jed,rains more
Jed,struck by lighting
Jed,"just a recommendation, don't build for storms out of the gate, build for storms a few level-ups later"
Jed,cause if you build for immediate storms your character sucks at first
Jed,
Jed,aight buff grappler is no longer op (or buff)
Jed,"still has that hilarious grapple -> freeze combo, but I removed the additional bubble thing, reduced her damage, health, and defense"
Jed,"op buff grappler might come back at some point tho, it's too good an idea to pass up"
Jed,Suddenly a swarm of goats ascends into the air and generates a whirlwind which dispells the storm
Jed,ok you can't have flying goats
Jed,I'm pretty sure that one's impossible
Jed,C H E C K THE RULES
Jed,See if there is a levitation charm
Jed,yes but it only applies to you
Jed,you can't levitate other people
Jed,
Jed,wait shit you can
Jed,Thats actually a bummer
Jed,but you have to also be flying
Jed,OKAY
Jed,SO MY MAN
Jed,Dang
Jed,YOU ARE TELLING ME
Jed,I need this
Jed,I'll be like storm
Jed,I CAN LEVITATE WITH A SWARM OF MINITUARIZED GOATS
Jed,"technically, yes"
Jed,technically I am about to nutt
Jed,you will be basically useless in all other situations tho
Jed,oh shit im prolly gonna die
Jed,If I dont levelup my characters normal abilities
Jed,smh
Jed,"cause the charms you need for the levitating, the size changing, and the size changing applied to goats are all really expensive"
Jed,like lots of experience to get to them
Jed,and lots of mana-equivilant to use them
Jed,damn
Jed,how long will this run take?
Jed,for us to complete as a group
Jed,I have no idea
Jed,Whats the longest run you have done?
Jed,once a week for like 8 months
Jed,Are you willing to DM this all the way through if it takes a million years
Jed,but I've never DM'd
Jed,and I don't know how long my planned plot will last
Jed,Im so hyped bois
Jed,my advice is roll with a smaller goat-related goal
Jed,if he gets goats I want wolves
Jed,no fuck you
Jed,wOW
Jed,offended
Jed,goats > everything else
Jed,WOLVES
Jed,jokes
Jed,are cool
Jed,its a meme
Jed,ur a meme
Jed,same issue as with goats - you can only realistically run one wolf or goat at a time
Jed,Please tame your flying miniture goats
Jed,sad
Jed,then I will have one wolf friend
Jed,unless you want to spend a fuckton of exp on making them little
Jed,THEN MAKING THEM LEVITATE
Jed,christ
Jed,this is gonna be a good time
Jed,"on that note, it's 230am, I'm going to bed"
Jed,'night sylki
Jed,night sylki

Jed,Why?
Jed,

Jed,I literally screenshot that line when I was playing thinking it fit you perfectly @Trapezoider
Jed,I wish I could control my desires smh
Jed,If I could keep the same level of motivation I get for stuff in the beginning over a long period of time
Jed,I would be a god
Jed,The only thing I do that with is piano
Jed,How do I improve this low trait consciencousness part of myself?
Jed,I wish that I stopped getting kotaku articles suggested to me by google

Jed,Kotaku I don't care
Jed,"""Breath of the Wild's Best Shrine is A Spike-Filled Death Maze"""
Jed,its moral to use adblock on kotaku
Jed,Kotaku I don't care
Jed,"""Super Mario Odyssey Player Beats Game Without Jumping"""
Jed,"Kotaku, I care a little bit about that, but I'm not reading your shit"
Jed,"""On The Origins of Sombra"""
Jed,"Kotaku, the character is over a year old. You're a little late to the party"

Jed,He appears to the north

Jed,And flies south to the valley
Jed,Then descends
Jed,Then you just wait for his gust of wind
Jed,He never fucking comes to the trench
Jed,And paraglide around him till his horns turn blue

Jed,Yeah prolly
Jed,@Jed
Jed,Is that online or in person
Jed,Also @Sak von Sak
Jed,Online
Jed,Can you talk for a few minutes?
Jed,There aren't really any locals
Jed,I didn't think their would be
Jed,"Cool piece of data from an old stats exam I'm doing (this is an actual cited study, ie true data): Researchers tested a sample of women shortly after they had given birth in a large urban hospital. Each mother, blindfolded to prevent sight or smell, felt the hands of her own infant plus two others of the same sex. Of the 68 mothers with at least an hour exposure to their newborns, 47 correctly identified their own baby."
Jed,What the fu
Jed,That is incredible
Jed,"the actual question wanted us to figure out exactly how unlikely that is to occur by chance, and the result was the most extremely unlikely result I've seen in this entire course"
Jed,even taking into account the relatively small sample size
Jed,"the exact percentage value isn't even included in the chart we get for calculating exact percents cause it's so unlikely that every point is basically the same, but the actual value ends up being less than 0.000000001% that that result was a fluke"
Jed,"basically, if it is actually pure guesswork and only 1/3 of the time they should have guessed right, there's a less than 0.00000001% chance that the study would produce those results or results more extreme than that"
Jed,That's mental
Jed,Yo is it homosexual to be a mother?
Jed,"No, it is incest though"
Jed,Like
Jed,you had your kid inside of you
Jed,

Jed,"@Melee This combo video has a lot of sentimental value to me as it was one I really enjoyed during my early days of melee. It also shows a lot of the story lines of the time and, in a way, is even better now considering we know what will happen with Hungrybox.

Jed,cool
Jed,don't spend it all in one place
Jed,ye
Jed,im leaving my rig mining every day
Jed,and its free because I dont pay electricity
Jed,so $4 a day
Jed,not bad over a year
Jed,spread your marvelous bounty across multiple vending machines
Jed,Yo just gonna save the btc I get
Jed,so youre basically stealing from your parents
Jed,lololol
Jed,are you fucking retarded
Jed,You steal by existing
Jed,I wonder what the actual electricity breakdown is tho
Jed,All of us did
Jed,no its charity
Jed,but there's no way he's drawing enough that it's noticeable
Jed,then they are being gracious enough
Jed,to pay my electricity bill
Jed,well If I was paying it
Jed,It would be enough to make my profits negligible
Jed,also the current btc directory is 150 gb
Jed,smh
Jed,the blockchain is so huge
Jed,does it really take that much energy to make bitcoins?
Jed,yeah you are basically running your gpu on max all day
Jed,huh
Jed,do you know what a gpu is?
Jed,it's the graphics card
Jed,its a graphics processing unit
Jed,yeah
Jed,essentially
Jed,the calculations needed to generate bits on the blockchain
Jed,are very similar to graphics processing
Jed,so gpu's work best for btc mining
Jed,and running a modern gpu on full power
Jed,all day

Jed,"one of my non-exam courses finally got all the marks in, due to the wonder of bonus marks I managed to squeak my 89 up to a 90"
Jed,which is a huuuuuge deal
Jed,cause 89 is treated the same as 80
Jed,and 90 is treated the same as 100
Jed,"one thing about math stuff is that a lot of the time things that sound super complicated are actually pretty straightforward, but I think I've finally found something that sounds pretty much just as complicated as it is"
Jed,"""One-way completely randomized analysis of variance"""

Jed,@The Rona
Jed,?>
Jed,how was ur exam
Jed,my dude
Jed,good
Jed,One question that I didn't know how to do though
Jed,there was a question that i had no fucking clue what the answer was on my programming midterm so i just guessed and got full marks
Jed,like is was the second most heavily weighted question
Jed,"""what are the 5 steps of pre planning"""
Jed,"and i was like i think nityan has said something about DDIT (Design, Develop, Implement, Trace)"
Jed,but thats only 4
Jed,fuck just add F to the end and say final test
Jed,and apparently that was right
Jed,so I guess an earthquake just happened where I'm at?
Jed,Are you dead?
Jed,I wish
Jed,I didn't even feel it tbh
Jed,oh prolly cause it wasn't in my city
Jed,are you suicidal
Jed,Why would you WANT an earthquake????
Jed,cause that'd be awesome
Jed,Dude death by earthquake would be epic
Jed,I didnt feel it either
Jed,I think these fags are lying
Jed,also @Feral Nebula
Jed,its almost T I M E
Jed,i s  i t
Jed,ye
Jed,It was centralized in mollala so that's why it was weak if that here
Jed,well we better get used to it
Jed,were going to be south of the bay area in two years
Jed,Lots of earthquaks my dude
Jed,also my phone is almost as big as my switch
Jed,smh
Jed,Oi lmoi
Jed,boi
Jed,I was playing this cocky ass clairen who taunted after every kill
Jed,and he taunted before I died last stock game 2 and I killed him for it
Jed,and then took game 3 as well
Jed,so satisfying
Jed,@Jed Which character were you playing?
Jed,ranno
Jed,GG
Jed,destroy all Clairen players
Jed,but you played Clairen in tourney...
Jed,that was because sylki revealed what I was actually playing
Jed,but still
Jed,you used what you despise
Jed,ye
Jed,hes right
Jed,you refuse to teach me clairen
Jed,because you dont want anyone playing clairen
Jed,then you play him in tourney
Jed,Why do you think I took the character choice path I did in melee
Jed,the logic here actually makes sense
Jed,I picked the character that beat my previous character the hardest until I got to fox
Jed,Marth to Shiek to Puff to Fox
Jed,if you hate op characters
Jed,why the fuck do you play fox lmao
Jed,Fox is not OP
Jed,he has weaknesses
Jed,so does clairen
Jed,He wouldnt be beatable if he didnt
Jed,not in the same sense
Jed,I DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING
Jed,AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED ANYTHING
Jed,DON'T PIN THIS ON ME
Jed,to beat clairen you just have to play better
Jed,also kameron wrecked your Clairen thus not OP
Jed,To beat fox you have to play better
Jed,Clairen has not real exploitable weakness
Jed,thats literally how rivals goes
Jed,lmao
Jed,you must play better
Jed,Clearly false if kam can beat you?
Jed,"poor you, you have to play better to beat someone"
Jed,my Clairen has under 2 hours total play time
Jed,boo hoo
Jed,By play better I mean play better + extra
Jed,so you can play better than them and still lose if it isn't by enough
Jed,Also the fox matchup...
Jed,lmao
Jed,Falco Marth and Samus all go even with fox
Jed,no one goes even with clairen
Jed,How can that be true lmao
Jed,which part?
Jed,No one goes even with clairen
Jed,From my experience either her range or her down b make her beat every character
Jed,Then get gud
Jed,^
Jed,or play a better game
Jed,@Jed
Jed,you gonna take that shit?
Jed,I think max complains too much about a character that I've heard commentary from good players
Jed,Real talk I still almost always beat Clairen on ladder and against Jed. I just think the character is stupid.
Jed,so get gud does not really apply
Jed,I'm already good I just don't have fun when playing against her
Jed,games are meant to be fun
Jed,"I dont have fun playing against fox. Does that mean fox is bad, and we should all complain against fox?"
Jed,so it isn't a matter of OP just a matter of not liking the matchup
Jed,Are you gonna quit melee because you hate the falco matchup?
Jed,No
Jed,cause I don't like playing against Zetters
Jed,You grind the matchup
Jed,DO YOU THINK I ENJOY SAMUS PUFF
Jed,and get good
Jed,it does apply
Jed,DO YOU
Jed,Why would you play melee if you you hate the matchup that you will be playing more than any other @Trapezoider ?
Jed,Because I like conquering the thing I despise with all my heart
Jed,that was really only right after the dlc dropped
Jed,Its why I play the game
Jed,Its also why I go through cycles of not
Jed,playing
Jed,Because I get frustrated and do rage quit the game because of dumb matchups I suck at
Jed,But
Jed,I kEEP  COMING BACK
Jed,but you still enjoy conquering the hard matchup
Jed,I don't
Jed,Because the eternal alure of the mountains I have to climb is more addicting than most thrills in life
Jed,hence why I never play bad characters in anything
Jed,The only thing Im pointing out why its dumb for you to complain about a strong character
Jed,Because you are the guy who defaults to strong OP characters
Jed,
Jed,strong does not equal over powered
Jed,Semantics
Jed,naw actually that's valid
Jed,but still
Jed,I think you're overreacting to clairen
Jed,^
Jed,If I liked her I would play her
Jed,I've been annoyed about it for a while just never said anything
Jed,you did play her...
Jed,for a day
Jed,In tournament
Jed,ONE MATCH FOR THE MEME
Jed,that is not evidence
Jed,that was not for the meme
Jed,"Why am I getting attacked over hating a character??? If Sylki randomly decided to post ""I hate falco"" I garuntee this wouldn't happen. Let me have an opinion."
Jed,you were mad that I said you weren't playing clairen
Jed,which you thought told kameron who you were playing
Jed,so you played clairen
Jed,I do hate falco
Jed,but I sucked it up
Jed,and I'm now pretty good against falco
Jed,honestly I think that Rivals is a fairly balanced game and its moreso playing the opponent than whatever character they choose
Jed,same with sheik
Jed,I sucked it up and I'm alright at the matchup now
Jed,now you are a G 0 D
Jed,its all about the grind matchup isn't important
Jed,so my brother works at uber
Jed,and apparently he takes an uber to work every day
Jed,"and frequently has a conversation that basically goes:
uber driver: so, where do you work?
my brother: oh, I work at uber.
uber driver: neat, how long have you been driving for them?
my brother (presumably insufferably smug): hahahaha no I'm an engineer at uber."
Jed,Does he get free Uber credits tho
Jed,yeah he gets like $200 free uber a month
Jed,
Jed,yo that man is straight up about to revolutionize the way we transport
Jed,Uber published a 95 white paper on electric VTOLS
Jed,I read the whole thing
Jed,Im hooked
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,is he working on that?
Jed,nope
Jed,he's doing some thing for people to sign up

Jed,

Jed,Did they fucking pass the repeal
Jed,Yep
Jed,Fuck

Jed,Jed Canada is an option right?
Jed,yeah I think we still get net neutrality lol
Jed,finally a widely acceptable way that canada > us
Jed,The vote went 3-2
Jed,It passed
Jed,Canada here I come 
Jed,"Better health care, net neutrality"
Jed,"there's a lot of things I like about canada over the us, they're just not things that are universally appreciated (like free health care, gun control, adding 'u' to the spelling of words that don't strictly need it but imo it looks better, a more logical election system, better skiing, not being a terrorist target, etc.)"
Jed,Better skiing 
Jed,it's true
Jed,mostly just cause we've got more area that has good skiing weather so statistically we get more good mountains for skiing
Jed,you guys get a bit of the rockies and that's about it
Jed,"okay Google, how do I get Canadian citizenship"
Jed,honestly you can kinda just show up and ask nicely
Jed,if you live here and have a job at least
Jed,So not an extremely long difficult process like the us?
Jed,"we have a system that basically ranks you based on how much we think you'll benefit our society which takes a bit to get through (especially if you get ranked low), but honestly upper middle class white people showing up and getting a job on visa is pretty much a guaruntee that you'll get citezenship"
Jed,it's not instant but it's faster than the states
Jed,
Jed,"one thing that was kinda funny is that the states introduced a plan kinda like that, where people get ranked based on desireability and some canadians were acting all offended and like 'wow that's not a nice way to decide citezenship, canada's above shit like that'"
Jed,@The Rona Going to see Star Wars tonight 
Jed,noice
Jed,it's supposed to be reaaaally good
Jed,wait who has seen it?
Jed,my showing is the first
Jed,prescreenings exist
Jed,especially for reviewers so that they can have people say it's good to get more people to come watch on opening night
Jed,I normally don't trust mass opinion of whats good. I'm just hoping it isn't a copy paste of Empire Strikes Back like the last one was a copy of A New Hope.
Jed,It probably will be
Jed,"Or they will do something cool 
Like switching Rey and kylo rens place"

Jed,Because big development
Jed,Google just invented a new deep learning ai
Jed,Which beat another Google ai (alpha go- ie the best go player in the world) in 100 out of 100 games
Jed,So they just improved the best ai by 100 fold
Jed,Ai developments are so non linear
Jed,It's incredible
Jed,fuck yeah Canada #1 country

Jed,"Cause it's built around a bunch of criteria for ranking people, it can be almost impossible or really easy depending on what you do and don't meet"
Jed,@The Rona good luck on exams mate
Jed,Also canada is weird as heck yo
Jed,"it's honestly a fairly good system, we let you in based on how much you're likely to contribute to our country"

Jed,he used to smoke when he was younger
Jed,so I guess he knows
Jed,So he's okay with you vaping?
Jed,I don't think so
Jed,I was giving it to them because my mom was concerned that I would be tempted by it while they were gone
Jed,cause I'm tryna sell it
Jed,Would you have used it if they didn't take it?
Jed,nah
Jed,I don't have anymore juice
Jed,I'm just tryna sell it rn it is kinda pointless
Jed,hold up whats the deal with vaping

Jed,ay wrenchd is playing in the rcs tourney today
Jed,I agree
Jed,bruh what if you looked through a 1 way mirror and on the otherside was a mirror
Jed,cause wouldn't it just reflect nothing?
Jed,or reflect a reflection of a reflection
Jed,it'd be just like two mirrors reflecting each other
Jed,just without you being in it
Jed,but like
Jed,what does a mirror look like
Jed,it reflects light
Jed,whatever light is present will be reflected back and forth between the mirrors
Jed,literally all mirrors are one-way mirrors with a solid thing stuck to the back
Jed,"the reason one-way mirrors work is cause one side is way darker than the other, and on the light side enough light is being reflected that you can't see the stuff on the other side"
Jed,I highkey wanna buy a one way mirror now
Jed,yeah
Jed,Ok
Jed,The Last Jedi was really fucking good
Jed,like a room like this
Jed,
Jed,but with an external light source
Jed,so you don't see all the lights reflecting
Jed,problem with external light is that then you'll just see the outside
Jed,that only works because the light is on the inside
Jed,ah
Jed,I see the error now
Jed,Who the heck is using the Frostbite gamers Twitter account?

Jed,"in other words, they have a quota of ethnic diversity to meet"
Jed,"in other other words, time to get screwed for being white"
Jed,yo non-whites check your privilege
Jed,So what was that about white privilege again?
Jed,lol

Jed,THEN WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME IF IT WON'T AFFECT MY LIKELIHOOD BEING HIRED
Jed,"Because equality only applies to those who are not white straight males obviously, because we already have the whole of the white supremacist patriarchy on our side."
Jed,Things like this might be why the number of liberals decreases as age increases.
Jed,maybe
Jed,I think it's mostly just society moving left over time so the younger generations will be more left just by virtue of being born in a lefter time

Jed,Vote Now! [Hunter] [Priest] [Mage] [Shaman] [Warrior] [Paladin] [Warlock] [Rogue] [Druid] [Monk]
Jed,@Homies Looks like Nier Automata isn't part of the holiday sale.
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,should I buy skullgirls?
Jed,its 2 dollars
Jed,Its worth $2
Jed,Just know its very different from smash games
Jed,kk'
Jed,it's pretty good
Jed,but on the flip side neither me nor max is really playing it anymore
Jed,max just kinda isn't and I'm mostly playing blazblue and guilty gear
Jed,more things go on sale as the time passes
Jed,but it's good for if you're not sure if you'd like traditional 2D fighters and want to give it a shot
Jed,If you buy the game I'll pick it back up and learn a new character
Jed,My old main was garbage as a solo
Jed,eh yeah if you buy it and max picks it up again I will too
Jed,but if you main peacock I'm disowning you
Jed,any character where explaining how to get around their basic zoning takes more than six minutes is a character whose shit I refuse to put up with
Jed,"oh also you might be amused by this game just cause, at least until he picks a new main, my best character is more or less the best in the game and max chose one of the worst -_-"
Jed,*unknowingly
Jed,same on my end
Jed,"I just saw the guy who taught me playing them and went ""hot damn that looks sick"""
Jed,and my other character I mostly started playing cause they have a skin that makes them look just like my favourite character from persona 3
Jed,I picked my character because she has the least suggestive outfit
Jed,lol
Jed,"I still think it's pretty funny that of the two clone characters, one of whom is meh and the other is top tier you chose the lower tier one"
Jed,is skull girls sketch bois
Jed,define sketch?
Jed,FAN SERVICE
Jed,I mean yes
Jed,but they mix things up with it so that it's not pure fanservice
Jed,"like the character who's basically a bunch of limbs stitched together and can stretch those limbs out on individual tendons, throw her head at you, and wrap you in a ball of intenstines"
Jed,or the character who is literally just made out of blood
Jed,what the FUCK
Jed,or the unholy monstrosity that is my best character
Jed,thats fucking nasty
Jed,who is a shapeshifting undulating flesh blob
Jed,but there's plenty of characters with basically no fanservice
Jed,like big band
Jed,who is basically a ton of brass instruments in a trench coat
Jed,and with two on screen this is a thing that can happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qcjCnkbROY

Jed,Is this a TAS?
Jed,yeah I think so
Jed,still great tho
Jed,and his lv5 super you have a little space to just jam out on the trumpet while time is stopped and if you end on the right four notes it activates
Jed,"brief history of why this is hilarious before I post the clip, in team fighting games, if you catch an assist and point character at the same time, it's known as a Happy Birthday"
Jed,"taken to its logical conclusion, https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyDepressedSpiderPeteZaroll"
Jed,KPBLive Playing Skullgirls - Twitch Clips
Jed,Happy Birthday - Clipped by MegaMissingn0
Jed,That is amazing
Jed,but in general it's not too hard to make teams where none of your characters are particularly fanservice-y
Jed,my current team is these two:
Jed,
Jed,and I'm probably gonna add either you
Jed,or you
Jed,"on the flip side you could always run eliza, valentine, and cerebella:"
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,but if you do that max's head might explode
Jed,I would also refuse to play against you except late at night
Jed,just you wait till I get you to play street fighter 5 and then pick up r mika
Jed,like seriously who thought this was reasonable
Jed,I've played street fighter and I thought it was super boring
Jed,it's mostly neutral
Jed,whereas sg is mostly punish
Jed,and I mostly just wanted to show that skullgirls isn't actually all that bad in terms of fanservice in fighting games
Jed,but I don't think I could bring myself to play someone whose design is that much shameless fanservice
Jed,I think the upshot of this whole discussion is you should all drop like $30 on guilty gear so we can learn together and I can fight you with a reasonably dressed girl who can summon motherfucking dolphins
Jed,I've seen that character
Jed,She looks pretty fun
Jed,"on top of which, playstyle-wise she's pretty much what I look for in a character - good zoning, but when you get in you can go ham"
Jed,"There is a chance I do buy it, but before I do, I want to have a conversation about the game."
Jed,I've only played like an hour
Jed,and only in tutorial and training mode
Jed,so I dunno if I can give a serious recommendation yet
Jed,i played the game for a bit i wasnt a fan adn refunded it
Jed,combos felt clunky
Jed,and hte punish game seems weak
Jed,every move is safe on block from what i could tell
Jed,from what I've heard the execution is reallllly tight
Jed,no idea about the safe on block bit
Jed,from watching it seems like there are definately safe block strings but they're not infinite
Jed,and this is a personal thing thid doesnt make the game bad but i prefer button block to directional block
Jed,i think i recall skullgirls had directional
Jed,but dont quote me
Jed,yeah it does
Jed,don't like... all fighting games?
Jed,at least all the ones I've played do
Jed,blazblue's got a weird mix
Jed,well i mostly play mortal kombat
Jed,i mean i still like fighting games that also have directional block like MvC
Jed,MvC is a crazy looking game
Jed,its a fucking nutty game
Jed,"never played it, but it feels a bit too much like two-touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, you win"
Jed,its more like
Jed,low sweep to uppercut knockup to 100-0 air juggle
Jed,i mostly just like the characters
Jed,love capcom and marvel so
Jed,combo of hte two always nice
Jed,my friend  plays the shit outta street fighter and i cant do shit agianst him
Jed,he mains ryu and im like hey man could you just play someone different so i dont get 100-0'd and he says yeah then swaps to ken
Jed,like thanks man he has the exact same moveset
Jed,lololol
Jed,apparently they're pretty different in sfv at least
Jed,but not... any other game really
Jed,ay apparently pubg is officially out of early access and they optimized a ton of stuff
Jed,yeah it is
Jed,it looks super good
Jed,its fun
Jed,I played so much last night
Jed,might take a stab at it again and see if my computer can handle it
Jed,@Trapezoider @Jed you man's are living together?
Jed,nah
Jed,I'm just at his house for 2 days
Jed,he's at work rn XD
Jed,Ye
Jed,Man's will be living together in 2 years tho

Jed,Which one should I attend ?
Jed,if you can get anything probably evo
Jed,or big house
Jed,I would do big house over evo honestly.
Jed,but evo is closer to you
Jed,but its also vegas
Jed,which is probably more expensive
Jed,and my parents probably wont let me go to vegas alone
Jed,but big house is in maine right?
Jed,it's in michigan
Jed,or you could come to goml 
Jed,where is that?
Jed,canada?
Jed,
Jed,Totally will if we do doubles together fam
Jed,I just wanna go to one major before this game dies

But, if you ask to use the machine, specifically to do some photocopying (ie, something that sounds like a reason but is actually just a redundant statement of what you do with a photocopier) the percentage of people who'll let you cut ahead jumps back up to 93%, only 1% less than if you give a valid reason"
Jed,if someone told me they were gonna use the photo copier to make spaghetti hell yeah im gonna let them go ahead of me i wanna see where hes going with this
Jed,"naw it's more like they go ""Can I use the photocopier? I need to make some copies."" and you're 33% more likely to let them use it than if they just ask ""Can I use the photocopier?"""
Jed,i like my version better
Jed,@The Rona due to the strike instead of my final math exam being cumulative of everything we've learned its only about logarithms and straight lines
Jed,ez marks
Jed,we couldn't even finish the logarithms unit so its only the easy logarithm stuff
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,In addition if you add the word because it increases your likelyhood i.e
Jed,"""I need to use the photocopier because I am in a rush and need to make copies"""
Jed,Are you in a psych class?
Jed,based on what the study was comparing (actually having a reason vs. having a sentence structure that sounds like a reason but isn't) that would be around the same as just saying that you're in a rush
Jed,naw I just stumbled across it
Jed,my fuckin family got one of those smart thermostats and so during the day when nobodys home the house is freezing to conserve energy but im fucking home during hte day they dont change it for the days i dont have college
Jed,why arent you back in school yet?
Jed,School isn't all day at university/ college
Jed,Dont you guys live on campus?
Jed,I thought you were dorm boys
Jed,dorm is really only a first-year thing in canada
Jed,Devon lives at home because the school is close
Jed,Dank
Jed,I go to a different school than him though
Jed,You go to waterloo right?
Jed,Yup
Jed,daNK
Jed,art thou in their coop stuff?
Jed,"Im in a ""Digital literacy class that is an absolute meme"
Jed,"cause they have like, the best co op in the country"
Jed,This is for people whomstve havent even used computers basically
Jed,plus you dont go to school everyday in college usually @Trapezoider
Jed,like i only have school 3 days a week
Jed,what
Jed,lucky bastard
Jed,There is a super attractive female next to me. Im gonna get her name tomorrow
Jed,Then number
Jed,I've always had five days a week
Jed,Welcome to college Sylki
Jed,Five days a week for me
Jed,but Im out by 1:30 everyday
Jed,I almost didn't this term but I had to move a course from first to second term so I'm right back on five days a week
Jed,welcome to mixing and matching your courses so you get a good schedule
Jed,and my stuff's mad spread out some days
Jed,although one of my days is 8-6
Jed,I'm not in a co-op program
Jed,I hate that shit
Jed,"today, I have 5 hours of class spread from 830am to 930pm"
Jed,I want all my classes to be back to back
Jed,I can still do it though if I want to
Jed,back to back classes is great
Jed,Wait doc you dont have females in your classes?
Jed,TF
Jed,"however, cause it's the first day of classes, I skipped my 830 cause they're just gonna go over the syllabus and I would only have had like 4 hours of sleep, and my 630-930 class got cancelled cause the prof has flu"
Jed,i have a 3 hour break on thursdays but me and my boys jsut go into town and get food during it
Jed,That's not what co-op means
Jed,lol
Jed,Thats what is means here
Jed,co op is mixed school and work terms
Jed,so you get a fuckton of experience by the time you graduate
Jed,im aware of what co-op menas
Jed,"It's basicly like an internship where you go an work for a company, but you get paid"
Jed,andrew isn't tho
Jed,Ive always heard it in referring to genders
Jed,Thats dank as fuck
Jed,im in the college with the #1 rated co-op program in ontario
Jed,oh
Jed,internships are actually paid pretty often
Jed,the terms are almost interchangeable at this point
Jed,just that internship can mean you don't get paid
Jed,true
Jed,you get paid in experience
Jed,yay
Jed,yeah but that blows
Jed,im gonna buy all the stuff with this experience ive earned
Jed,I ain't applying to no unpaid internships
Jed,what is the ratio of experience to bitcoins?
Jed,the same as the ratio of leprecauns to unicorns
Jed,http://puu.sh/yX1Jg/2cc62ab9e5.jpg
Jed,Anyone wanna buy .05 of a bitcoin
Jed,"thats like $10,000"
Jed,no
Jed,its $700 usd
Jed,no it really isnt
Jed,devon
Jed,"still, one thing I prefer from my school's internship stuff vs waterloo's coop is that waterloo does 4-month so you're basically in, trained, given some menial tasks for three months then booted out, whereas we do full-year stuff so you actually get better experience"
Jed,http://puu.sh/yX1L4/3087ec02dd.png
Jed,you are fucking wrong
Jed,"bitcoin are $15,000 usd"
Jed,"15,000 * .05 =$750"
Jed,What are you smoking?
Jed,he said .05 not .5
Jed,oh you said .05
Jed,DORK
Jed,not used to people not putting a 0 before hte decimal place
Jed,fucking americans
Jed,Those god damned yankees
Jed,that's not uncommon here
Jed,just not super common either
Jed,bruh i aint never seen it
Jed,wut
Jed,is the GTA just like a mini america inside ontario
Jed,Devon I can assure you that we have seen it
Jed,ye
Jed,cause dont you people call like chapstick blisterrods or something
Jed,basically
Jed,we also have aids here
Jed,lol not really
Jed,@The Rona well im sure if i actually looked at the board during math call i'd have seen it
Jed,also I've literally never heard the word 'blisterrod' in my life but it sounds horrible
Jed,what do you call chapsticks
Jed,isnt there like a wierd nickname
Jed,i could've sworn
Jed,"sometimes it goes by one of the brand names (blistex), like kleenex instead of tissues"
Jed,blistex
Jed,thats what it was
Jed,but that might be a french canadian thing honestly I have no idea in my house
Jed,fair

Jed,4
Jed,"one
two
three
four

Jed,You can add up to 4
Jed,why did my four not work
Jed,Gya
Jed,no
Jed,fuck

Jed,I give up
Jed,bvreaks

Jed,Gyazo
Jed,
Jed,max it means I left 3 hours after
Jed,and just got home because I got asked to go buy groceries
Jed,Still down?
Jed,I'm eating but I'll play after
Jed,GUYS! I NEED HELP! I feel like characters on the left are a stolen design of characters from the Fate Series. If you've seen the Fate series please help me out here!
Jed,"I mean, same hair eye color"
Jed,there are a few Fate parody type things
Jed,they might be from one of those
Jed,where did you find this?
Jed,"I made it myself, I took the left screenshots from an anime, I don't know the name of it, but the opening is called Apron Boy"
Jed,"When I first saw these characters, I initially thought it was an ending to a Fate anime, but then I saw that it was an opening and not even the same series"
Jed,is it from this? https://myanimelist.net/anime/37033/Emiya-san_Chi_no_Kyou_no_Gohan
Jed,Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan
Jed,A Fate/stay Night spin-off focused on cooking.
Jed,I think it is.
Jed,"well yeah, it's not stolen then it's just a spin-off"
Jed,besides I don't think character theft is a thing that happens in the anime industry
Jed,but what do I know
Jed,"Thanks for clearifying that, and I didn't think they were stealing the characters, I thought they were stealing the designs and naming them different characters"
Jed,"But one last thing I do find strange is that, Spin-Offs (or at least the ones I've seen) usually have a different cast of characters with members of the previous cast making side appearances. But I could be wrong"
Jed,I haven't seen many spin-offs so I don't really know. I guess there's just different ways to do it
Jed,maybe
Jed,@Trapezoider I'm ready
Jed,@Trapezoider We playing PUBG or not?
Jed,I'm cracking up
Jed,this kid I know from kingston used to play tf2
Jed,apparently
Jed,one of his teammates thought he was a girl
Jed,and was kinda sorta hitting on him constantly
Jed,which the kid didn't discourage
Jed,it eventually culminated in the guy buying the kid a csgo knife
Jed,he is living the trap dream
Jed,Did the guy ever find out?
Jed,yeah after awhile the kid felt kinda bad and told him and asked if he wanted the knife back
Jed,"to which the reply was basically 'naw you're a chill dude, keep it'"
Jed,wow what a guy
Jed,why give hte knife back
Jed,he scammed it fair and square
Jed,How expensive was the knife?
Jed,um
Jed,lemme check
Jed,"according to the steam market, $81.45"
Jed,Not bad
Jed,so like $65 usd
Jed,respectable scam
Jed,i used to scam people in warframe out of platinum
Jed,made like ~$200 worth of plat off it
Jed,I'm fufilling my namesake
Jed,Time to start scamming bibbas by fufilling mh destiny
Jed,Someone give me the trap tah

Jed,gross you used an emoji
Jed,hoooooly shit
Jed,been reading for the last little while
Jed,and hoooly shit the plot twist
Jed,never have I ever seen such a comprehensive plot twist
Jed,something that somehow seeped into like... everything
Jed,What are you reading?
Jed,it's part of an unfinished series (book 3 of an eventual 10)
Jed,"The Stormlight Archives, by Brandon Sanderson (my favourite author, and probably his best series thus far)"
Jed,fucking impressive plot twist
Jed,it was even the kind of thing where it's like 'there is going to be a plot twist about this'
Jed,but I was not expecting anything like this
Jed,@deleted-role
Jed,maybe?
Jed,sure
Jed,"there's a kazahkstanian csgo player whos name is Jame ""Jame"" Jame"

Jed,@Trapezoider Want to play melee?
Jed,You can't spell team without meta
Jed,i can play till 9 30
Jed,db6385d8
Jed,@Max
Jed,melee?
Jed,I dont have class till 12
Jed,@Trapezoider Sure you still here?
Jed,461a67c7
Jed,max I need to wait a few mins before I can play
Jed,So my parents can leave
Jed,okay
Jed,join when ready
Jed,kk
Jed,what matchups do you wanna do
Jed,When your parents leave can you join voice?
Jed,also is genesis tomorrow
Jed,No I can play
Jed,Wen I went down
Jed,They told me not to play games
Jed,So I gotta wait
Jed,Genesis is this weekend
Jed,early events may start thursday or friday though
Jed,I am probably going to start on falco
Jed,kk
Jed,After that we can play Shiek Falcon
Jed,kk
Jed,@Max
Jed,yeah?
Jed,"random thought - we have the term 'shot dead' for someone who is shot, and dies from it, but we don't have similar terms for other ways of dying or getting killed"
Jed,no 'stabbed dead' or 'drowned dead' or 'heart attacked dead'
Jed,english is weird
Jed,we're the only language where a double positive can result in a negative
Jed,wait how
Jed,yeah right
Jed,lol
Jed,I will still hold up verbal quebecois french as the most comprehensive idiomatic butchering of a language
Jed,four twenties ten 
Jed,naw that's just the language
Jed,I'm aware
Jed,I'm talking more the degree to which they mash english in and randomly remove syllables
Jed,fuck saying 'petit' (small) let's just say 'tit
Jed,"fuck saying 'voiture' (car), two syllables is too many let's just use the english word for it"
Jed,le tit snow
Jed,"also, in some rural regions in quebec they just randomly add 'la la' to the end of every sentence despite it having no semantic meaning within the sentence"
Jed,also they invented a completely separate set of swear words
Jed,which results in some truly unique cussing that you just don't really get to see in english
Jed,"because they'll mash together quebecois swearing, french swearing, and english swearing"
Jed,cause each language's/dialect's swearing has different stuff that's considered swearing so you can get really inventive
Jed,I've almost paid for pubg by selling crates
Jed,Nice
Jed,How much dollar
Jed,I haven't been playing since the update so no crates for me
Jed,Also Jed can you hang this weekend irl?
Jed,I'm at like $20
Jed,and idk
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,yikes
Jed,Were you heavily invested in cryptocurrencies @Trapezoider ?
Jed,what caused the crypto bubble to finally burst?
Jed,"dammit. I had a controller coming in for a bunch of fighting game stuff, was supposed to arrive tomorrow, but they showed up today only no one was home cause it wasn't supposed to come till tomorrow so they just took it back till tomorrow"
Jed,it literally changed nothing from my expectations but I could have had it tonight and that makes me mad
Jed,"fuck you too psychology, why'd you invent loss aversion"
Jed,I'm not sure whats happening today but I just had a perfect game in rivals the other guy didn't even touch me
Jed,everything seemed really slow
Jed,"I've only ever had one such game. They are rare and special, I hope you enjoyed it."
Jed,so I put a sandwich in the toster oven (wanted to heat the insides too)
Jed,"the top slice of bread, the one exposed to the air, burned to a crisp"
Jed,"the bottom one, the one pressed against the hot metal?"
Jed,"lightly toasted, slightly damp"
Jed,I do not understand thermodynamics
Jed,@Trapezoider Still interested in melee tonight?
Jed,duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude
Jed,"I just won a solo
I dropped gun range and went to bunker but someone was there so I went for a uaz
but a dude was already in it so I said wait no can I get a ride with you and he stopped and let me in and he was like where are you from and he was chinese and it worked so perfectly like we ran at the last guy and he died and then the other guy got zone boned"

Jed,also let this be a lesson to work on your mentality
Jed,if you took my lessons seriously you would be way better
Jed,mentality isn't a joke
Jed,if you don't mind getting bodied you'll play way better
Jed,was a huge turning point for me
Jed,I mind getting bodied by someone who has been playing for 1/32 the amount of time I have
Jed,huge ego destruction
Jed,"like if you watch the handful of sets I'm on stream, I'm laughing at myself and me getting bodied and silly things"
Jed,going in with a positive attitude literally makes everything better
Jed,be happy for the other person doing sick stuff to you
Jed,"and afterwards consider what you could have done better, what worked, and what didn't"
Jed,keep the negativity for analyzing yourself later
Jed,The reason you are not good with your number of hours is because your hours are not meaningful. They are just random friendlies. You don't watch as many tournaments as Kameron (which I consider to be very important) so he knows how top level players move and combo. He also takes advice all the time while you just want to play a specific way and are too stubborn.
Jed,@Mr. Airplane I challenge you to a best of 9 set january 27th at 11pm EST
Jed,why an even number

Jed,including egg yolk
Jed,which has sunk into the fabric
Jed,this backpack is officially fucked
Jed,I guess instead of getting work done and going to office hours I'm instead going to have to go way out of my way to somewhere they sell backpacks and get a new one
Jed,RIP Sylki's backpack~ Unknown-2018
Jed,amazon same day delivery
Jed,I'm barely gonna be home today and if you miss the delivery stuff gets weird here
Jed,and I'd have ot go way out of my way to the UPS place to pick it up
Jed,Here they just leave it at the door
Jed,Same
Jed,unless its something super expensive like a phone
Jed,student housing is too sketchy for that here
Jed,like anything could get stolen
Jed,"also, rough backpack lifespan is like 2011-2018"

Jed,any of the good m2k plup sets
Jed,Sweet. I'll review those on my lunch break
Jed,Sylki do you ever miss classes?
Jed,occasionally
Jed,I don't recommend it
Jed,my basic rule is I will skip review classes of stuff I already know really well or early morning classes if I get less than 5 hours of sleep
Jed,or classes where the prof is so legendarily awful that it's easier and faster to skip the class and read the slides
Jed,That's a good rule to follow. I had to miss one today and I kinda wanted To die.
Jed,Ugh my teachers are lazy and don't make slides
Jed,just make sure yoou catch up on what you missed
Jed,Thankfully we have blackboard and I can do everything from I class online. Do you guys use blackboard?
Jed,nope

Jed,Brb
Jed,dem custom skins are wack
Jed,true
Jed,mostly don't look like what they say they look like
Jed,also it'll take one hell of a skin to make me give up on my coral kragg
Jed,coral krag?
Jed,
Jed,@Trapezoider coral kragg
Jed,I always get a bit sad looking at the really nice custom skins I have for characters I never play -_-
Jed,god this assignment is annoying
Jed,"""There is no solution to this. Just try to find the closest thing you can."""
Jed,and it's not like math where you can get an answer that still has some variables in it
Jed,there's literally no way to get from the starting point to an equivilant - if vague - end point
Jed,@here games?
Jed,maybe in a bit I've got a bit more work to do
Jed,cool-cool
Jed,
Jed,@Zain I'll preorder as soon as you do
Jed,but I thought you had to preorder it before the closed beta started
Jed,but idk
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL if you pre order now you get into the closed beta everyone is playing right now but I don't think am gonna buy it cuz it ends in like 2 days I'll prob buy it when I comes out
Jed,I have found a kragg skin that I would replace my coral kragg with
Jed,shame you have to buy it
Jed,
Jed,Now I'm hungry.
Jed,Yeah burrito kragg is cool
Jed,oh also kameron a top etalus confirmed with me that orcane beats etalus
Jed,no word on orcane kragg yet though
Jed,Once you get to the top tho matchups matter less
Jed,Still true tho
Jed,I somehow ended up in a weird roa discord for ontario/quebec and it seems pretty chill
Jed,also we might be entering a crew in a tournament where the winning team gets burrito kragg skins
Jed,I doubt I'm good enough to be on the crew though
Jed,What's the name of it?
Jed,it's only for ontario/quebec people
Jed,so I doubt you're in it
Jed,Aight
Jed,Just know there's a crew tourny coming up that my crews gonna be in
Jed,aight now I have to try to get into this crew if it's the same tournament
Jed,I want to die
Jed,I just spent 20 minutes debugging a four-line program
Jed,how
Jed,the problem was I used the wrong kind of quotation marks
Jed,...
Jed,"' ' instead of "" """
Jed,fuck haskell
Jed,like if its 4 lines id literally jsut rewrite hte htiung
Jed,I did
Jed,it still didn't work
Jed,cause apparently haskell's picky about your quotation marks
Jed,but the error message won't tell you that htat's the problem
Jed,it was telling me the problem was on the line after that
Jed,well i mean wanting you to actually use quotation marks rather than apostrophes isnt really picky
Jed,every other language I've ever used doesn't care
Jed,they've always been the same thing
Jed,but now they're not
Jed,and I can't tell what the actual difference is
Jed,i spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why my program kept skipping an input and realized i have a buffer overflow
Jed,ah that's always fun
Jed,@Rivals of Aether GOML 2018 might have RoA
Jed,Nice
Jed,anyone who might show if it does? cause apparently they're trying to gauge interest atm

Jed,might make my own crew
Jed,Yeah it's not exclusive to canada
Jed,didn't think it was?

Jed,sub for what?

Jed,I'm in a crew @Sak von Sak
Jed,well if we get max and a sub we're still fine

Jed,could you?
Jed,when is it?
Jed,it's spread over next week
Jed,presumably in the evenings
Jed,we probably won't need you but you have to sign up with four and a sub
Jed,"sure, I guess I'll sub. I'm not that good at the game though so if I do play I'll probably lose"

Jed,need to finish a lab and shower but after that I'd be down
Jed,how long do you think thatll be?
Jed,hour or two
Jed,not sure how long the lab's gonna take
Jed,"and especially because it's a programming thing built around a concept I've never actually used before, it could be super simple or take ages"
Jed,this is some of the worst debugging I've ever written
Jed,there's so much redundant stuff
Jed,but it was useful like half an hour ago
Jed,and I'm afraid to delete it in case it becomes useful half an hour from now
Jed,@Melee I got invited to the Icons closed beta! I'm under NDA though so please don't ask me questions about the game.
Jed,what is nda
Jed,non disclosure agreement
Jed,Also what is this game?
Jed,A melee style fighting game
Jed,Max is that the good news?
Jed,yes
Jed,oh my god I want to kill myself

Jed,"I've been debugging this for an hour and a half and it's a constant 'one step forwards, two steps back'"
Jed,you know what I always say @Sak von Sak
Jed,programming isn't real
Jed,I feel you
Jed,the sooner you realize this the sooner you can accept it
Jed,yo the rivals character select screen is organised by element type
Jed,totally just realised that
Jed,Dude
Jed,so the last character will be air
Jed,I knew that
Jed,And I don't play
Jed,shhh\
Jed,@Jed you wanna try out that weird version of rivals with me?
Jed,sure
Jed,"alright, technically I can beat jed"
Jed,"practically, it takes like 15 tries and a lot of salt"
Jed,ranno's jank
Jed,so are platforms
Jed,but not at the same time
Jed,the count was 11-3 or
Jed,but some of those were sylvanos
Jed,yeah at least one of them was us seeing if sylvanos jab spikes
Jed,and you killed yourself three times in like twenty seconds
Jed,oh true
Jed,"still, once I was more warmed up we had close matches"
Jed,I would have won that one kragg one if I hadn't killed myself by fastfalling next to the stage instead of onto it at like 20%
Jed,Icons is fun
Jed,I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT FUN RIGHT NOW

Jed,are the numbers you chose for peoples id's random or do they have meaning
Jed,My plan was to never actually mention what someones number was but others have given specific numbers. I would guess that they are random but you should check with whoever wrote the chapter.
Jed,okay just making sure no one has some foreshadowing on those numbers or a purpose to them
Jed,In college business class
Jed,professor asks someone to give description of what supply and demand means
Jed,I give description

Jed,I cannot believe the synchronis landing cycle was successful
Jed,This just set multiple records
Jed,I believe this is the first car to be launched into space
Jed,On the most powerful rocket
Jed,Thats also reusable
Jed,And was also funded and researched by a private citizen
Jed,cant wait till spaceman makes it to mars
Jed,Im so curious if the mainfcore made it to the drone ship
Jed,Im checking every news feed possible and space
Jed,x'x twitter but no one has news
Jed,I NEED TO KNOW
Jed,Do you guys get why im such an elon fan now?
Jed,Yeah how long till the core comes down?
Jed,It should have come down 7 minutes ago
Jed,Oh
Jed,"They lost signal due to interferences though
And they cut off the stream before confirmation"
Jed,Im super triggered
Jed,That was so cool though
Jed,That was dumb

Jed,I am creating the DC calendar
Jed,Let's get these dates locked down ASAP
Jed,dont you already know mine?
Jed,Ye but send me your schedule
Jed,For summer
Jed,@Zain @Feral Nebula @Trapezoider @Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane @The Rona The spreadsheet has been made and should be in your email
Jed,"So bros, my parents track my phone and are super oedipal and annoying about knowing where I am. Today however I found a very convienient app that can spoof my location. :) Life just got a lot better"
Jed,lol gg dude
Jed,
Jed,on a scale from 1 to tm06 how toxic is this
Jed,@Homiesgames?
Jed,"andrew, I feel for you and all, but I'm pretty sure oedipal is not the right word"
Jed,oedipus (or however you spell it) was the guy who banged his mum and killed his dad
Jed,I'm gonna assume you just meant anal
Jed,"as in anal retentitive, as in super control-freak-y"
Jed,if you can spoof your location you can fool your parents but also think of how easy it would be to play pokemon go
Jed,@here games?
Jed,shut the heck up
Jed,ok
Jed,"apparently, if every chicken dinner in pubg was an actual chicken dinner, enough have occurred that you could feed the population of iceland for a year"
Jed,I don't know who goes through the trouble of figuring this stuff out
Jed,but it's great
Jed,@Sak von Sak melee or pubg or somethin?
Jed,naw studying atm
Jed,kk
Jed,got midterms next week
Jed,@Sak von Sak post that canada pic about the population
Jed,what if he don't
Jed,i cri
Jed,I don't have it
Jed,it was never me
Jed,pretty sure ocean man's got it
Jed,@Sak von Sak pretty sure oedipal was the word I was looking for. In my context it means the helicopter mother and father who are emotionally dependant on me and take away responsibility I should have for myself by being over protective and over bearing
Jed,dude raisins are gay
Jed,craisins however
Jed,NUT
Jed,but that's not what happened in the story
Jed,
Jed,he was abandoned
Jed,I'm not talking about the story????
Jed,cause prophecy saying he'd kill his dad and murder his mum
Jed,It's a word from frued
Jed,but that's where the term comes from?
Jed,he used it in the context of the story
Jed,Pretty sure it's from civilization and it's discontents
Jed,oedipos complex is freud's thing
Jed,Oedipos and oedipal are different
Jed,http://www.dictionary.com/browse/oedipal
Jed,the definition of oedipal
Jed,https://youtu.be/EPAfS8-wm8g
Jed,Jordan Peterson: Female Pathology (The Oedipal Mother)
Jed,Full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek
Jed,I think we're having a definitional mismtach here
Jed,I need to update my knowledge of this topic
Jed,'spose they're different meanings for the same word
Jed,I was running off that video essentially
Jed,"but in common perception, oedipus-related stuff immediately goes the mother-fucking route"
Jed,LOL
Jed,a statement which is based in a different psychologist's work -_-
Jed,"Yeah I read your definition and I was like ""fuuuuccckk"""
Jed,Basically sees his dad as a sexual rival lmao
Jed,jung get out of our freud-based discussion dammit
Jed,That's fucked up dude
Jed,Yeah get the fuck out Jung
Jed,eh I like Jung's stuff honestly
Jed,who tf is Jung?
Jed,Fucking coming in here with your collective unconscience
Jed,Stupid bitch
Jed,"well the main thing is the idea of the collective unconscience, which is ironically usually misunderstood"
Jed,Jed he was essentially Sigmund Freud 2.0
Jed,aight
Jed,"the way jung has it is that it's the collection of ideas, archetypes, and such that are common to basically everyone - symbols that pretty much everyone will understand and associate with the same things"
Jed,"amusingly, the collective unconscience is often represented as a literal collective, shared part of the uncounscious mind that is in some way attached between people"
Jed,so the collective unconscience isn't really a part of the collective unconscience
Jed,"also Jung and Freud were pretty different in how they approached stuff, from what I remember"
Jed,although Jung did carry on some of Freud's stuff I'm pretty sure mmost of his theories were pretty different
Jed,it's been awhile since I took psych so I'm gonna go dig this up
Jed,While we wait for sylkis notes
Jed,@Rivals of Aether Jed?
Jed,for a little bit
Jed,sylki do you know a rivals player named sableye?
Jed,he is in Ontario I think
Jed,he's in that discord but other than that I dunno
Jed,aight
Jed,@Trapezoider get in nerd
Jed,"they both worked a lot with the unconscious, but Freud focused more on repressed, but still present stuff, as well as the id/ego/superego stuff and the kinda wacky psychosexual stuff for describing behaviour, whereas Jung focused more on the shared stuff between people, how we understand society and ourselves in relation to it"
Jed,sadly one of the major reasons I remember as much about Jung as I do is that the persona games kinda swooped in and built a lot of the series off his theories (especially Personas 4&5) - Jung is literally the guy who came up with the term 'Persona' in the way that it's generally used today

Jed,Easy money
Jed,I dont know what certifications are in canada
Jed,But here in the states
Jed,EZ
Jed,only have my bronze medal and TBH im not fit enough to get the cross rn
Jed,oh in canada you need to complete 3 seperate 12 week courses
Jed,so ive done two
Jed,havent finished the third
Jed,for lifeguard shit?
Jed,Damn canada
Jed,yeah
Jed,well its your job to ensure safety of the public
Jed,Mine was one week of training/testing for certifcations
Jed,so id assume it'd be pretty hard
Jed,really?
Jed,damn america is wack
Jed,How long are the sessions?
Jed,2 hours
Jed,It was 8 hours a day for 5 days
Jed,but only once a week
Jed,oh
Jed,okay it comes out similar then
Jed,America is retarded but definitely not that retarded
Jed,"2x12x3=72
8x5=40"
Jed,TIL you cant use * to show multiplication on discord
Jed,Ye i just checked my calculator because something didnt seem right with me saying they were close
Jed,32 hour difference
Jed,LYike
Jed,TBH you can easily cover it all in 32 hours especially if you have them back to back
Jed,so its not that wack
Jed,40*
Jed,my issue i couldn't finish was hte distance swim
Jed,i mean i did finish it
Jed,but barely
Jed,how long?
Jed,300 m right?
Jed,1600m in 12 mins
Jed,did you have to do the brick?
Jed,100m pool 16 lengths
Jed,oh yeah the brick was fine
Jed,Brick = ez
Jed,the brick was weird cause you could jsut stand on the bottom
Jed,without floating back up
Jed,TF?
Jed,We did it in the deep end
Jed,yeah no im saying
Jed,when you are at the bottom of the pool usually you float up
Jed,@Max Melee?
Jed,but with the brick you can just stay on the bottom
Jed,so it felt weird
Jed,Oh yeah
Jed,I like chilling on the bottom with the brick
Jed,same
Jed,Sneaky snekking my way around
Jed,Grabbing peoples legs
Jed,we always had to cram the swimming stuff in the first hour cause for the second hour the synchro team would take like half hte pool
Jed,so it meant even when our instructor was just talking to us we had to focus on not sinking since we could only have the deep end
Jed,Are you going to complete your certs?
Jed,i really should
Jed,@Trapezoider how do I aquire such a test drive
Jed,go on the website and apply
Jed,here ill send link
Jed,wait shit you have to be 21. I need to cancel 
Jed,Lmao
Jed,Rip
Jed,finishing your certs isn't that that hard
Jed,so long as you have decent eggbeater you're fine
Jed,I got mine and then never managed to actually get a lifeguarding job -_-
Jed,now they're pretty much all expired
Jed,I'd have to do all the hardest ones all over again
Jed,mango is at the cs_summit
Jed,eggbeater?
Jed,treading water with legs only technique
Jed,super useful for carrying people
Jed,especially for spinals where you have to move at a constant pace or risk causing way more damage
Jed,@Trapezoider for spinals do they teach the Canadian hold thingy in the states?
Jed,.+
Jed,for spinals we actually use a backboard and try to stabilize as best we can until the backboard can be used
Jed,The goal is to get the person into shallow water and maintain stability of the spinal erector and neck
Jed,Since we dont really know the extent of a given injury
Jed,Man sylki you and I become more and more similar the more i get to know you
Jed,
Jed,wait did they not teach you spinal carry stuff for before you can get them to the board?
Jed,They did but I dont remember 
Jed,dammit now I don't get to know if they taught you canadian carry
Jed,which they'd better have cause it's the best
Jed,I have no idea :(
Jed,

Jed,uuuuuuhhhhhhh
Jed,I can only play like 1 or 2 games
Jed,actually I cant play at all
Jed,highest HP boss in the history of gaming:
Jed,
Jed,I see your boss and raise you http://xenoblade.wikia.com/wiki/Gradivus%2C_the_Headless_Emperor
Jed,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor"
Jed,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor (Japanese: 首無皇帝グラデウス, Kubinashi Kōtei Guradeusu) is a Tyrant in Xenoblade Chronicles X. It is a member of the Millesaur family. It can be found at level 71 at the..."
Jed,"100,000,040 health"
Jed,also for the record this is a lv71 enemy in a game where the level cap is 60
Jed,i see your boss and I raise you again (i found this on reddit)
Jed,also where'd the extra 40 come from on that xenoblade boss?
Jed,no idea
Jed,but that is its health
Jed,the post-game bosses in this game are stupidly strong
Jed,cause there's a lot of weird optimization stuff
Jed,there's a boss that's 39 levels above the level cap
Jed,ie a lv99 when your max level is 60
Jed,that I can understand a little because they wanted to make it like other RPGs where the level cap is 99
Jed,"I tried taking it on as a joke at lv56, I got one shot"
Jed,tpk in one hit
Jed,you have to optimize so hard to win
Jed,I remember one time I took on a boss (which I didn't think was a secret boss) at a low level and I got one shot. I took me about three days to realize that he actually was a secret boss.
Jed,"I generally try to stay away from RPGs that require the use of so many complicated game mechanics (like optimizations, synthesising, equipment boosting, etc). Most of the ones I play have them, but I can ignore them and still manage to beat the game (main story at least)."
Jed,main story's totally manageable without any particular optimization
Jed,but they left some crazy stuff in for the crazy people
Jed,so they'd have some ridiculous completionist challenge
Jed,"yeah. For me, I just really only play games for their story aspect. If I really enjoyed it I'll go back and try to 100% it."
Jed,"same, but I do think it's cool"
Jed,also the particular crazy enemies are super interesting in terms of design and lore in this game
Jed,"intersting. I've never tried a Xenoblade game, but now I'm curious. Any recommandations to start with?"
Jed,start with the original
Jed,if you've got a wiiu/switch I think you can get it on the virtual console
Jed,xbc1 is one of my top 2 rpgs
Jed,I don't have a wiiu or a switch
Jed,ooooor you can just emulate it
Jed,unless you want to pay like $100 for a wii copy
Jed,yeha no thanks
Jed,xbcx is pretty good but it's more worldbuilding and sidequests than a direct story
Jed,haven't played xbc2 cause I don't have a switch
Jed,"also I don't know how the timeline of xbc1 and 2 work, but xbcx is totally separate"
Jed,is xb a wiiu/switch specific game?
Jed,it's nintendo specific
Jed,ah that explains it
Jed,"original was wii, X was wiiu, 2 is switch"
Jed,I'm really more of a ps fan
Jed,have you played any of the persona games?
Jed,I wanted to play persona 4 but I wasn't old enough when it came out. I DESPERATELY want to play Persona 5! I looks SOO COOL!
Jed,god p5 is good
Jed,it's the other of my two favourite rpgs
Jed,if you've got ps3 I think there's versions of personas 3-5
Jed,"p3 has versions for ps2, ps3, and psp, p4 for ps2 and ps3, and p5 for ps3 and ps4"
Jed,i have both a 3 and a 4 so I'm kinda in luck
Jed,yeee get p5
Jed,I'm trying to
Jed,is it hard to find a copy? or just not enough money?
Jed,not enough money
Jed,aw
Jed,just starve yourself for a week
Jed,it's worth it
Jed,lol
Jed,"btw, if you like persona 5, are you going to watch the animation coming out soon? Just curious?"
Jed,yup
Jed,"if possible I'd recommend playing before watching, the adaptations are a little less deep"
Jed,and especially in the case of p4 the pacing's wack
Jed,that is if they don't change the story progression first
Jed,both adaptations have been pretty faithful
Jed,I remember one of my favorite games got an anime adaption and it complete changed how the game was
Jed,slight changes to accomadate the protagonist not being a player-insert character
Jed,"but other than that, consistent"
Jed,admittadly the faithfulness is what caused the p4 adaptation to be weirdly paced
Jed,well yeah they kinda have to cram the possibly 20+ hour game into a 12 episode season
Jed,that sounds like it would end badly
Jed,"i wouldn't if they divided it over 2 seasons, which the anime adaption of my favorite game did but poorly"
Jed,20+ hours should probably be 50 episodes at least
Jed,"most likely, but you got to think, most of that time is possibly running around looking for what your doing, travel time, and filler content"
Jed,true
Jed,so theoetically it would really be 10-15 hours
Jed,"with persona games pre-5, they were like 60ish hours but a lot (probably 20-25 hours) was storyless combat, and they always have to trim side stuff (which is a lot of persona games), but they manage to fit just about all the important stuff in"
Jed,and that's what important. Though I don't mind the occational filler episode since they're the funniest
Jed,p4's got great filler
Jed,"cause it's so character focused, it doesn't even feel like filler"
Jed,I don't even know why you would put filler in a movie
Jed,movie where'd that come from? (and you wouldn't)
Jed,Persona 4's adaptation is a movie I think?
Jed,no it's an anime
Jed,naw that's backwards
Jed,"p4 is a 25 episode anime, p3 is 4(?) movies"
Jed,"but yeah, fillers can be good, as long as they progress the story or develop the characters even a little amongest all the fan service"
Jed,one of the p3 movies has one of the best hot springs bit I've ever seen
Jed,there's plenty of character development but it's also just funny
Jed,and not much fanservice
Jed,one of my favorite fan service bits from a game was a hot springs bonus scene from a game called Tales of Xillia 2. Oh my god it's freaking hallarious! You really don't even need to understand the game to think it's funny
Jed,basically what happens is the guys are swallowed by this living doll (that's actualyl a party member) because the girls didn't want them around. And they end up getting digested in the doll's stomach. It's the dialogue that makes it funny

Jed,let me join except not because I dont play rivals

Jed,release it now as well
Jed,on some non trapezoid yt
Jed,kk
Jed,just got in like a ten minute argument of me vs the majority of the ontario rivals discord about discord light vs discord dark
Jed,I have successfully convinced them that it's ok to use the light theme
Jed,so now hopefully no one's gonna get on my case for using it
Jed,Fuck you Sylki. I do not like you because you use white discord
Jed,that's racist
Jed,you don't like me cause I like white
Jed,"in all seriousness there are valid arguments against white, but 'it's too bright it hurts my eyes' is BS"
Jed,"it's the exact same white as like, everything else on your computer"
Jed,"behold, a screenshot of discord, where part of the picture is a screenshot of a word document"
Jed,IT'S THE EXACT SAME COLOUR
Jed,Ack! My eyes!
Jed,It burns
Jed,^
Jed,thai food is dope
Jed,uwu
Jed,Thai food is infact dope
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,Join the master race. Discord white is superior and all of the discord dark people can  kiss my ass
Jed,ew gross I didnt know you used discord light
Jed,we're not friends anymore
Jed,eat ass
Jed,no
Jed,go die
Jed,smoke grass
Jed,
Jed,and sled fast
Jed,
Jed,"""Sled fast, eat ass"" - Dan the Meme man"
Jed,"brief reasons why I use discord light:
1) anyone who says it's too bright is fucking stupid. It's the same white as everything else on your computer that uses white - word, facebook, google, etc. - and you can clearly manage it just fine there.
2) my eyes are borked and reading light text on dark background gives me brutal headaches if I do it for too long, which happened a bunch when I tried out discord dark.
These are objective facts. You can say you think discord dark looks better and that's fine, but don't try to tell me that it's too bright and don't tell me I should give myself brutal headaches to match your aesthetic sense."
Jed,Why do guys care about this so much?
Jed,It doesn't even matter.
Jed,except I have applied a dark skin to a majority of my web services
Jed,^
Jed,"I only care cause any time I put a screenshot up everyone goes 'ew discord light' and I feel victimized, you monsters"
Jed,and I always have discord up on my other monitor so it does tend to feel bright
Jed,so I feel the need to explain that due to actual physical problems discord light is better for me
Jed,There is nothing wrong with light
Jed,also I get annoyed at the 'it's too bright' thing
Jed,yeah that's fair
Jed,light's not right
Jed,but people like trap who just use it cause they are dumb
Jed,thats who we can make fun of
Jed,I still think it's dumb to make fun of people for preferring a different visual style
Jed,unelss they think ping pong the animation looks good
Jed,in which case hell yeah I'll make fun of them
Jed,hypocrisy intensifies

Ok everyone I know drowned in pools"
Jed,wait actually Dad made top 24
Jed,I'm not quite sure how because based on the bracket he just randomly appeared in loser's round of 24 and then lost 2-3
Jed,"he's not in any round before that, in winner's or loser's"
Jed,this bracket's super weird
Jed,it looks like a few people I know made it out of pools
Jed,but they all seem to appear in the main bracket at different places
Jed,and they all immediately lost

Jed,
Jed,@Eric Working From Home if you give me the entire file i can help you out
Jed,http://puu.sh/zx0Tf/c88135a0d2.zip
Jed,"Yeah you can summon a group of objects in Java, but can you summon Lord cuthulu?"
Jed,summonLordCuthulu();
Jed,you're need to create an object to call the method
Jed,so
Jed,"AbyssalLord C = new AbyssalLord;
C.summonLordCuthulu();"

Jed,@Max this sounds like an agreeable proposition.
Jed,Isn't it torbs daughter? @The Rona
Jed,Yeah
Jed,I forgot my mic is broken
Jed,sorry
Jed,@Zain @Bitmin We are going to be playing a new social deception game later tonight if either of you wants to join
Jed,it's hella fun you should join us
Jed,I'll hopefully be able to acquire a working mic by then
Jed,is it coup
Jed,yup
Jed,Can I join too?
Jed,sure
Jed,depending on how many we get we may need to split into two groups
Jed,is there a maximum number of players?
Jed,more than 4 would be awkward I think
Jed,you can't play with more than 7 but at that point it's a complete and total mess
Jed,why?
Jed,more than 4/5 would be hard
Jed,I want to keep it civil
Jed,"too many things to keep track of the more people you add, also you start running out of cards"
Jed,I think that having more people would be better because you can use the cards people have discarded by dying to try and figure out if someone's lying or not
Jed,The more players there are the less turns you get and the less each player matters
Jed,also you can't use cards people died and left behind
Jed,i suppose thats true
Jed,Okay but boys whats up with this http://puu.sh/zxS8Y/c9282f5e8f.png
Jed,too late

Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture. One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.

When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school, while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends. Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the shadows of his past.

Jed,time to pray for lenient prof
Jed,I have a 12% assignment due tonight that I've been brick walling since monday
Jed,but I've missed office hours because I'm sick
Jed,so I'm totally fucked
Jed,I sent him an email and hopefully he'll extend it for me or just drop it entirely
Jed,but we'll see
Jed,Good luck my dude
Jed,How fooked are you if he doesnt help you out here?
Jed,What class is this for?
Jed,"it's scientific computing, which is a brutal class (super wacky linear algebra mixed with programming)"
Jed,and I'm really fucked if he doesn't help me out
Jed,because I was super duper behind and got a 0 on the previous assignment and a 0 on the previous test
Jed,like I'm currently failing the course
Jed,not because I don't get it but because I fell super far behind last time I was sick
Jed,"Sylki, I'm here for you my man. If you need to study for a test thats like memorization stuff I'll do online flash card review with you. I don't know the concepts but I can question you on then if you give me a review packet. Also can you give me a basic rundown on what linear algebra is, how it different from normal algebra, and what's it's current applications in computer science are? I have heard a lot of the deep mind guys talk about linear algebra having direct technical uses in machine learning"
Jed,"For optimizing ""fitness functions."" I barely understand any of this shit, so please enlighten my .0001% understanding"
Jed,Linear algebra is about vectors
Jed,In layman terms
Jed,"Okay the only context I understand vectors in is when closed cycle rocket engine ""vectors"" it's thrust to change directions"
Jed,Is there any analogy you can draw from that to the maths?
Jed,Its mostly about representing linear equations from what I understand
Jed,yes but that's a super simple way of thinking about it
Jed,it's basically super wack math that's not really analogous to anything else at the point I'm at
Jed,"in terms of usage, it's really good for machine learning and data analysis"

This game should appeal to a much wider audience, so even if you didn't like MCG, I would appreciate if you gave this one a try. The game will be having its first playtest tonight. Anyone who wants in please let me know!"

Jed,what time?
Jed,"No defined time yet, I will provide an update on the time once I have a better idea how much longer production is going to take."

Jed,Tfw you think you're getting tinitus but then you track the high pitched ringing sound to your refrigerator
Jed,LOL
Jed,that is such a thing I would do
Jed,Tfw you've always had tinitus and thought that everyone else did too
Jed,How would you even figure out that everyone else doesn't?
Jed,I mentioned it to my mom one time like last year and she was like oh yeah that's not normal
Jed,Hey that's how I figured out it was a problem that I mostly only looked out of one eye
Jed,"Dominant eye is a thing, but it's not supposed to be that dominant"
Jed,But I didn't realize that until I told someone about it
Jed,how do you only look out of one eye ??
Jed,Long years of unintentionally trainin myself
Jed,Probably stemming from having had a lazy eye when I was really young
Jed,I've had to manually retrain myself the last two ish years
Jed,And its kinda sucked (lots of headaches)
Jed,But I'm pretty much fixed now except when I start to get really tired or spend too much time frequently changing focus
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,I shouldnt expect to have this correctly?
Jed,How do I test if I do?
Jed,Itd probably cost you but you could get it checked out by an optometrist
Jed,"In general though, you should be aware of the ability to swap focus between each of your eyes while pretty much completely ignoring the other, and a difficulty using both at once"
Jed,"A good simple test - hold two pencils out in front of your nose, one roughly 8-10 inches away and the other 2-3 times that. Focus on the close one, and in your non-focused field of view you should see two versions of the far pencil. Don't worry of this doesn't pop up immediately or if it's hard to look for the split while keeping your focus on the close one, worry if you can't do it at all or if it's really hard to get the split."
Jed,It's not a perfect test but it's something I had to train myself to be able to do and apparently it's a pretty normal thing most people can do
Jed,is it good or bad to get the split?
Jed,Good
Jed,Cause that means both eyes are focused up close
Jed,it happens pretty much automatically for me
Jed,"And since they both have different angles to the far one, it creates the split"
Jed,Yeah you're fine then
Jed,"Out of curiosity, are you able to unsplit while keeping your focus close (ie doing what I used to do automatically)"
Jed,let me try
Jed,no not really
Jed,the only way to remove the split is to focus on the far one
Jed,that's super weird
Jed,"Well that's good, odds are you'll never fall into the same trap I did"
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,Seems like im good
Jed,Thank you for all the insight
Jed,Are you close to being fully healed?
Jed,More or less
Jed,It still kicks I occasionally and a few things with it are still messed up (including the reading white text on dark background thing) but overall it's pretty much better

Jed,Did anyone know that Doki Doki Literature Club is getting a second game?
Jed,"whaaat, I didn't"
Jed,is it official?
Jed,"Not yet, but Game Theroy made two videos breaking down Doki Doki and they concluded that it's getting a second game in 2018"
Jed,Based on Doki Doki's hidden backstory
Jed,I dunno if Game Theory has the authority to declare something like that 100%
Jed,More like gay theory tho
Jed,He wasn't the one who came up with it though. It was a whole ARG that people solved
Jed,"It's actually really cool and I'm super excited if this is true, which it most likely will be since they're pretty accurate with their theories"
Jed,@mrd256 can you link the vid?

Jed,does anyone else agree that times new roman is a super overated font
Jed,it's kindof an eyesore
Jed,"either ariel, calibri, or cambria should be the primary font for scholarly works"
Jed,not times new roman
Jed,also 1.1-1.3 line spacing is much more asthetically pleasing than 1.5-2 line spacing
Jed,I'm a fan of Calibri myself.
Jed,Yo kids we are back in business

Jed,that is not done yet though
Jed,its wip from the facebook page
Jed,bless
Jed,cause this book is super boring dude
Jed,hey
Jed,i need some weeb peoples opinions
Jed,@Feral Nebula @mrd256
Jed,so like we're having this debate
Jed,theres a lot more weebs than that here
Jed,do you think it was possible for hte people in SaO
Jed,to like
Jed,fuck
Jed,ingame
Jed,lol
Jed,why is that a topic of conversation
Jed,dont worry about it
Jed,it started off with some guy asking if he should get sea of thieves and we're here now
Jed,have you ever seen sao
Jed,ye
Jed,and they never definitivley answer
Jed,if you cna fuck or not
Jed,like
Jed,the main bitch strips then smacks the dude in the face
Jed,but thats as close as they get
Jed,Imma say yes
Jed,But I'm no weeb so my opinion doesn't hold much water
Jed,well considering she did strip chances are its possible
Jed,As long as they have genitals and can experience tactile sensations
Jed,okay so one of my main bitches linked me some SaO Smut and apparently its cannon that they can fuck
Jed,its not actually smut im like 80% sure its a cannon novel
Jed,but dont quote me
Jed,yeah but the whole point of the question is we don't know if they do or not @ trap
Jed,Did the girl who stripped have genitals?
Jed,for some reason I read that like the girl had her genitals stripped
Jed,she stripped to her underwear so its unclear
Jed,"so i got my boy james on the whole genital issue and all he said was ""idk they had dicks and pussies in the hentai i watched"""
Jed,james is high rn so hes not super helpful
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,okay so like
Jed,the other girls in the guild have fucked b4
Jed,so id assume they have genitals
Jed,tfw you play too much counter strike and get carpal tunnel
Jed,yo we should get some 8 man pubg going sometime
Jed,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Jed,Yo somebody kick this guy
Jed,Yo I just saw a police officer take somebody off a train with a m4 assult rifle and they say Canada dosent have guns lol but truthfully sorta spooked me a little
Jed,Where the fuck do you get an M4 in Canada?
Jed,Did the cop have it or the dude
Jed,fusion had it
Jed,Oh duh
Jed,the cop lol but yes i also have an m4
Jed,Arrest this man

Jed,Also I asked them about it in their discord and they were super condesending
Jed,@Jed wanna join a cs team? We lost a guy and need a lurk
Jed,I mean I'm kinda bad
Jed,Also what's the time commitment?
Jed,"I think we'd be playing around 4 nights a week. It would basically take up the free time you spent on rifles in pubg to some degree I imagine, but I still think it would be pretty fun to be on the team together. Especially since I'm not complete ass at the game now"
Jed,Prolly not

Jed,Wasn't it Burger King who bought them or something?

Jed,Eat shit moose fucker
Jed,Nah
Jed,You cross the border before you get to customs
Jed,"Wait you're wrong. If I was driving into Buffalo, I would be stopped by the US border. When I come back I would be stopped by the Canadian border"
Jed,"Y
Yeah no you cross into Canada before you get through customs"
Jed,There is a park n shit
Jed,You have to go through customs when crossing the border?
Jed,No after
Jed,You know what I mean
Jed,I mean like the booth where they ask you questions and shit
Jed,It just occured to me that you probably took a plane
Jed,Thought that qualifies as customs
Jed,Nah we drove
Jed,oh
Jed,Only like 7-8 hour drive
Jed,True
Jed,When you said customs I thought that you were referring to them checking your bags and stuff
Jed,Nah
Jed,They just asked like 5 questions and let us through
Jed,Yeah

Jed,Its funny how Leffen has gone from the villian to the savior of melee
Jed,IS LEFF BOUTA SAVE MELEE
Jed,die the villain or live long enough to become the hero
Jed,Is that a reference? It sounds like a line from something.
Jed,popular phrase

Jed,@Zain
Jed,@Max melee?
Jed,doing school work
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,I have defeated you
Jed,??
Jed,
Jed,???
Jed,I'm confused
Jed,it has something to do with fairy tail but other that I have no idea
Jed,"I just watched an episode of fairy tail where all the main characters turned into Batman. And they broke the fourth wall by saying ""oh no she's turned realistic"" considering such an odd episode I thought it might be funny enough to get you to watch so.e"
Jed,Some*
Jed,didn't work
Jed,Fuck
Jed,Nigerian whore sack
Jed,you're not supposed to start with saying you've defeated me
Jed,Somebody kick this guy
Jed,it encourages me to disprove you out of spite
Jed,also this wasn't particularly inspiring
Jed,Sylki I am determined to get you to watch this show
Jed,@Sak von Sak melee???
Jed,Sylki 1v1 me rust
Jed,"I'm more curious to know how DBZ wrangled its context to include the line ""Hold your fire, this man isn't black!"" with a straight face"
Jed,I can explain
Jed,If you watch fairy tail. I am a sucker for million episode shows
Jed,That never end :(
Jed,That is what long shows tend to do
Jed,Except fairy tail is over now
Jed,So is dbz
Jed,which is why they tend to suck
Jed,Except the movies that come out
Jed,"dragon ball is still going, dbz might be done"
Jed,Fairy tail definitely has some shitty story arcs not gonna lie
Jed,The highs are high but the lows are meh
Jed,"and my stance on super long shows is basically: I could watch several great short shows in this time, maybe I""ll do that instead"
Jed,What kind of show even is it?
Jed,the highs are bad the lows are terrible
Jed,why do you want someone to watch it with you so badly?
Jed,wait
Jed,ill watch it with you
Jed,i dont have anything better to do
Jed,@Trapezoider
Jed,"so I'm gonna watch made in abyss, and re creators, and higurashi, and grimgar, and monster, eureka 7, and your lie in april, and monster, and a fuck ton of other stuff first"
Jed,"""the highs are bad the lows are terrible"" ""I'll watch it with you"" MAKES SENSE"
Jed,am down to watch a bad show
Jed,I mean it can be fun to watch something with the intention of laughing at it
Jed,you still haven't finished made in abyss???
Jed,a gonna have fun making fun of it
Jed,see: me watching girls und panzer
Jed,ava I have watched like nothing in the last month and a half other than watching kill la kill with you and andrew

Jed,"Random thought: denotations of time make no sense. I mean days are reasonable - it's the time it takes to start dark, get light, then get dark again and you sleep in the middle - and so are years - turning of the seasons, earth going around the sun, etc. - but the rest are irrational. What is an hour? a minute? a second? a week? why do they fit so badly into each other? who designed this stupid system?"
Jed,Still better than the imperial system
Jed,I'm pretty sure the hour is used to tell the position of the sun
Jed,yeah but why are there 24 per dday
Jed,that's an arbitrary number
Jed,especially cause you can't see the sun for half the day
Jed,same thing with weeks
Jed,like I get it's pulled from god making the earth in seven days
Jed,but it's still weird
Jed,"at least months almost make sense cause thye're matched up to the cycles of the moon, sort of"
Jed,The system makes more or less sense depending on where you live
Jed,Also it takes 24 hours for the earth to complete one revolution on its center axis
Jed,yes but why TWENTY FOUR
Jed,like what is one hour that made us decide to use it as a measure of time? we have one day for one rotation of the earth
Jed,That doesn't not make 24 an arbiratry number trap
Jed,Yes it does
Jed,Because 24
Jed,>0
Jed,Get rekt
Jed,nerds
Jed,What
Jed,
Jed,Tfw ur mum gay
Jed,get  out of my christian minecraft server
Jed,Which one? @Jed
Jed,you heccin tard
Jed,@Jed
Jed,When are you back?
Jed,At like 6
Jed,The ur mum gay bit was aimed at trap
Jed,Because with his logic the gay clearly transferred
Jed,Yeah
Jed,gay traps > octagons and doctors
Jed,This just in the entire medical community is deemed worth less than one gay trap
Jed,@Sak von Sak time is done the way it is because it is in a base 6 number system
Jed,"60 seconds
60 minutes
24 hours"

Jed,When?
Jed,4-4:30 PST is start time
Jed,@Jed
Jed,Buy that esea my guy. Ill pay you at the gym tomorrow
Jed,@deleted-role I have created a meetup planning document. Please join it.
Jed,"on my exam today I wrote one of the most disgusting single lines of code of my life, which I will try to replicate here:"
Jed,| mod (length list) 2 != 0 = take (((length list)/2) - 0.5) (zipWith (+) list (reverse list)) : (head (reverse (take (((length list)/2)+0.5) list)))
Jed,it's highly efficient but it's such a mess
Jed,What does this even do?
Jed,"A direct translation of what it's doing: it checks to see if the length of a list is divisible by two, and if it isn't, it takes the first half (rounded down) values from a new list that it creates where each element is the sum of an element in the list plus that same position in the list if the list was backwards, and then concatenates that to the first value of the reverse of the first half (rounded up) values in the original list

A more straightforward explanation: if a list cannot be divided into two halves of equal length, it creates a new list where each element is the sum of the list folded over onto itself (so the first value plus the last, the second value plus the second last, etc., and the final value is just the middle value)"
Jed,"normally I would not do that in a single line, but in haskell you kinda sorta gotta unless you want to write ten times as much code"
Jed,I originally wrote out the whole function (which is more than just that) as way more code but I had spare time so I decided to write out the more efficient version I figured out halfway through an unrelated question later on the exam
Jed,I condensed like a page of code into three extremely disgusting lines
Jed,of which that was the worst
Jed,Damn son
Jed,also I get to cheerfully come home and start studying for my monday exam -_-
Jed,"someone put together a single slide deck of all the slides the prof said to study, and this is on the first slide"
Jed,fuck me

Jed,4b99e5e8
Jed,7c6998b8

Jed,@Zain thats too bad
Jed,@Zain sorry buddy :(
Jed,Are you getting hit by this storm as well @Zain
Jed,Does anyone know if hereditary memes can change the gene pool of a population to express different phenotypes more or less?
Jed,Memes are not hereditary
Jed,Hereditary memes?
Jed,are you okay?
Jed,Memes as in the cultural ideas that pass from mind to mind as first proposed by Richard Dawkins are hereditary in a sense. If you parents possess the meme of religion you are more likely to receive this meme from then
Jed,Religion is not a meme
Jed,That's not what he means by meme
Jed,A meme is a unit of cultural evolution
Jed,Religion is something that has evolved over time with culture
Jed,Religion = scientific meme
Jed,Not funny meme
Jed,memes predate religion
Jed,The reason I ask is because I have noticed a quarelation between religious females and their attractiveness. Not to say there aren't attractive atheist.
Jed,I have actually noticed this too
Jed,what
Jed,"I might just have the ""I grew up in a Christian home"" bias"
Jed,saying you find religious ones more attractive?
Jed,^
Jed,Possibly
Jed,yeah
Jed,There appears to be a quarelation greater than .6 linking thicc and religiosity
Jed,are you sure its not just confirmation bias?
Jed,I'm not
Jed,"There has actually been research that conservatives are on average more attractive. So since most Christians are conservative, maybe that is the correlation."
Jed,I want to test it
Jed,Research must be done
Jed,For science
Jed,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Jed,Yes. Go upto attractive women and ask them if they are religious
Jed,Then ask for their number
Jed,I told you about that movie thing right
Jed,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Jed,No
Jed,
Jed,Tell us
Jed,oh well one of my buds from West was like hey do you want to go to a movie with me and some other people
Jed,like its only him and girls at first so he invited me
Jed,and I was like aight I hadn't hung out with him for a while so I went
Jed,he was like oh yeah so I'm pretty sure one of the girls likes me so i was basically the wingman
Jed,Yoda noises intensify
Jed,I was walking in to the movies with him and the girl that liked him and she asked if I thought one of her friends was cute and I didn't wanna be rude and be like nah
Jed,and I mean she kinda was
Jed,so I was like yeah I guess
Jed,and she was like oh well she thinks you're cute too
Jed,and its funny cause I knew this girl when I went to school with her and we hadn't really talked a whole lot but now that i don't go there anymore she thinks I'm cute? okay then
Jed,jed is only cute when you don't see him everyday
Jed,but basically the rest of the time was them trying to get us together but I wasn't really tryna mess around
Jed,also side note truth or dare is the worst movie of 2018
Jed,but I was a successful wingman 
Jed,"That feeling is called ""saudade"". It's a word only existant in portuguese, it is ""the wistful longing for something you no longer have""."
Jed,i think
Jed,dont quote me
Jed,lmao
Jed,I almost sent it though but I think the only reason I didn't is cause I asked a girl out earlier that day and the response was a maybe but leaning towards yes
Jed,so friday was a weird day for me
Jed,What the heck man
Jed,Jed gettin all kinds of ladies
Jed,Fellas is it gay to date a lady?
Jed,^
Jed,I mean you are literally going out with someone who sucks dick

Jed,@Rivals of Aether lets do a tournament sometime 
Jed,@Trapezoider check your snap
Jed,Can someone help me with a thing on transformations of graphs
Jed,
Jed,Like I don't get what they want
Jed,g(x)=-7f(x) or f(x)=-7g(x) I would think
Jed,My problems are usually not in terms of f(x) and g(x) so I'm not sure which one goes where
Jed,but reflecting a graph makes the function negative
Jed,and stretching by a factor of 7 means multiply by 7
Jed,Can you show the functions represented by f(x) and g(x)?
Jed,Just tryna figure out where to input that information
Jed,No they don't show me the graphs :(
Jed,Did my suggestion not work?
Jed,I'm going to bed now but good luck.
Jed,@Trapezoider whenever you get a chance to look at it I shared it with you so just put comments where you have them
Jed,You don't need to know what f(x) or g(x) are
Jed,I don't remember exactly how it works but I'm pretty sure you want something like g(x) = -f(1/7 x)
Jed,cause the negative gives you the vertical flip and the 1/7 x gives you the horizontal stretch
Jed,@Max
Jed,Yes they worked
Jed,boo in my high school we wouldn't have gotten marks for cheesing a horizontal stretch as a vertical one
Jed,My dad shutoff my fucking internet
Jed,riiiiip
Jed,Fuck that guy
Jed,I'm 17 and you tryna give me a bed time

Jed,doc are you gonna be back in frostbite now that exams are over?
Jed,I've been here all week 
Jed,I havent seen you 
Jed,I just wasn't in the mood for any csgo
Jed,
Jed,Are you still planning on attending to meetup?
Jed,i miss you dad
Jed,"i got those airline tickets and ZACK
 is getting busfare soon"
Jed,*zack
Jed,fuck
Jed,Yeah
Jed,Nice
Jed,My parents would like to know if you buy tickets
Jed,I buy not tickets yet
Jed,Nice
Jed,lol
Jed,Did you even read what Max said @Trapezoider
Jed,I was mocking him
Jed,wait what did he say
Jed,Did he fix it
Jed,it doesnt say edited
Jed,Hello
Jed,If I say my message aloud it sounds perfectly fine
Jed,yeah
Jed,tense is a bit weird
Jed,My parents
Jed,"should be bought tickets, not buy tickets"
Jed,you can't read that and say that it was fine
Jed,Woud like to know
Jed,If you buy tickets
Jed,"but I know he has not yet, hence bought doesn't work"
Jed,no
Jed,because he hasnt yet
Jed,So they would like to know when he has
Jed,ok it could also be will buy
Jed,no it is do buy
Jed,using present tense doesn't work unless you're asking if that's what he is doing right now
Jed,or what he does in general
Jed,Holy fuck
Jed,Stop
Jed,"What do you for a living?
I buy tickets"
Jed,Yes
Jed,Have you bought tickets?
Jed,he was talking future tense
Jed,"""My parents would like to know if you buy tickets (some time in the future)"""
Jed,it makes sense
Jed,except that 'you buy' is present tense
Jed,its not
Jed,ok
Jed,what is the present tense of 'to buy' then
Jed,How about; if you are going to buy tickets
Jed,but that isn't what they want to know
Jed,yeah they want to know when(if) it happens
Jed,then you guys are just asking the wrong question
Jed,Then why would you use present tense?
Jed,"you should just ask ""are you going to buy tickets"""
Jed,that isn't the question either
Jed,no thats not it
Jed,literally don't even care
Jed,when are you going to buy tickets
Jed,he wanted to know when he buys tickets if he does
Jed,tell him after it happens
Jed,waezsxrdtcfvygubhnj
Jed,"then ask: are you going to buy tickets? if so, when? also, let us know when you do"
Jed,because the original question did not communicate that
Jed,thats over complicated
Jed,it's clear though
Jed,I UNDERSTOOD YOU GUYS ARE DUM B
Jed,THATS SOUNDS SO FORMAL
Jed,"Try it like this ""My parents would like to know if you die"""
Jed,same thing different words
Jed,The first question you asked did not communicate any of that information
Jed,it totally did
Jed,yeah but that's not how languages work because language is dumb
Jed,most verbs having to do with the state of a person have slightly different rules
Jed,I'm going to delete the message and leave this server if you guys don't shut up
Jed,it matters so little
Jed,omg
Jed,calm down
Jed,you understood what I meant
Jed,we didn't though
Jed,the end result would be that doctor would alert me if he purchased tickets
Jed,mission accomplished
Jed,*shrugs* 'spose
Jed,side question: am I alone in enjoying breaking down language and weird specifics of stuff? or is it just that I spent enough time having stuff beaten into my head while learning french that I've developed stockholm syndrome?
Jed,I find it to be very boring
Jed,It can be sometimes interesting
Jed,like in what just happened
Jed,I like comparing languages but being a grammar nazi isn't fun
Jed,I think it's neat

Jed,Is there an equation to calculate someone's response to a question
Jed,Pls
Jed,What does that even mean? @Trapezoider
Jed,Huh
Jed,Oh wow I actually wrote that
Jed,I thought that was part of the dream
Jed,Huh
Jed,Don't worry about it brother
Jed,haha what 
Jed,I had a dream I was messaging you guys in discord last night while trying to make an important life decision
Jed,Turns out I actually messaged you because I wasn't asleep yet :(
Jed,
Jed,I'm glad I fell asleep before the dream happened :) shit got real
Jed,This is so confusing
Jed,what was the decision?
Jed,Weather or not to do it to em boys
Jed,
Jed,How else would the dream had happened? Dreams only happen when you sleep.
Jed,That's untrue
Jed,Not if you're on drugs
Jed,I guess when you space out
Jed,Ever heard of daydreaming
Jed,but you're technically not asleep
Jed,...that's the point
Jed,"even if you daydream, you're not alseep, so you're not technically dreaming. You're actually deep in thought"
Jed,"yes, but your brain patterns 'n stuff are often closer to when you're falling asleep than when you're awake"
Jed,it's kind of an in-between state
Jed,take it from me who day dreams alot and has had some pretty messed up dreams in my life.
Jed,"BTW, while we're on the subject, have any of you guys tried to Lucid Dream?"
Jed,never actively tried but it happens every now and then
Jed,I am trying to master it so I can work during the night
Jed,I have. It's BEYOND trippy!
Jed,If I can lucid dream I can practice piano while I sleep etc
Jed,Even though I actually didn't try. My mind wouldn't settle down for some reason.
Jed,"Towards the end I actually got a little scared cause I was like, ""How do I wake up?!"""
Jed,Are you sure practicing piano in a dream would translate to real life??
Jed,Just form a cliff
Jed,Then jump off
Jed,weirdly it actually would
Jed,wild
Jed,cause you're training all the same bits of your brain that are holding the muscle memory
Jed,I think it would work
Jed,same patterns of brain activation
Jed,"I've heard if you die in a dream, there's a chance you could die in real life. Not know how true that is tho"
Jed,"probably not as well, but it could help"
Jed,also no that's 100% bullshit
Jed,thats not true
Jed,That's what I thought
Jed,well technically you could but it's the same chance as dying at any other point of your life
Jed,you're stupid
Jed,"Well maybe something could happen to your brain if you die in a dream, but that might not be true either."
Jed,You're brain doesn't function that way
Jed,It would have to produce a neurotransmitter which is toxic and produce it in high enough doses
Jed,"Well sorry, I'm not an expert on the brain functions!"
Jed,But the brain doesn't and wouldn't do that
Jed,wow neurotransmitter! That's a big word for you 
Jed,the placebo effect is strong but we're damn good at not tricking ourselves into dying
Jed,^^^
Jed,maybe it is for you but not for him
Jed,not everyone's retarded
Jed,"true... but I'm not, neither is he or you"
Jed,I don't know. None of us know you well enough to confirm or deny that. Except max and Ava 
Jed,that emoji makes me want to die

Jed,he picked me up cause apperently I beat a Kragg who is supposedly good
Jed,so I'm reading a javascript textbook
Jed,"""Every now and then, usually between eight and ten in the evening, Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail."""
Jed,what
Jed,"later on in the same chapter,

""For a few years, things go great for Jacques. But at some point he loses his job. Because he lives in a nasty country where having no job means having no medical services, he is forced to take employment with a circus where he performs as The Incredible Squirrelman, stuffing his mouth with peanut butter before every show.

One day, fed up with this pitiful existence, Jacques fails to change back into his human form, hops through a crack in the circus tent, and vanishes into the forest. He is never seen again."""
Jed,Why would this be in a java textbook?
Jed,Yeah what the hell
Jed,it was to set up the premise for data for a series of examples
Jed,"also, javascript, not java"
Jed,different languages
Jed,Would that make this any less weird?

Jed,wait why do you need to learn js reat dedux
Jed,redux
Jed,he wants me to make a website with it
Jed,and technically he's my boss
Jed,so that's what I'm doing
Jed,wait so you got an internship with your brother as your boss lol
Jed,yup
Jed,"nepotism, bitch"
Jed,wait so how are you planning to learn it react is pretty small but an not sure about redux
Jed,tons of massive ass tutorials
Jed,practice
Jed,what was that game
Jed,n0ne is a lunatic
Jed,that was way closer than it had any right to be
Jed,if he hadn't thrown away that ganon stock he could have won that
Jed,that recovery vs scorp tho
Jed,yeah that was unbelievable
Jed,was actually insane
Jed,I've never seen falcon recovery like that
Jed,imo n0ne is best at falcon recovery
Jed,god n0ne is the fucking best
Jed,wizzy is best at everything else
Jed,but sucks at recovery
Jed,s2j is just bad
Jed,s2j's ok at everything

Jed,@Jed
Jed,zack I asked her to go ice skating
Jed,This is the moment of truth Br0THER
Jed,did you ask her over text
Jed,I asked her on our run this morning when  she came over
Jed,and she said
Jed,She would consult other tentative plans. And would provide and answer around this time. Lookin like a fat no
Jed,"also, you guys have indoor rinks? didn't occur to me that the states would have that"
Jed,Hell yeah. There are like 2 nearby ish
Jed,r
Jed,i
Jed,p
Jed,F
Jed,F
Jed,"@Trapezoider  most likely if she said she'd concult plans it means she's not interested. (Or maybe she is, but most likely not...)"
Jed,or maybe she just doesn't like skating
Jed,we gotta stay optimistic
Jed,I'm with Zack
Jed,I guess...
Jed,I feel like skating isn't all that popular in the states
Jed,I tried ice skating this one time and I sucked at it.
Jed,fell on my butt like 20 times
Jed,yeah that's skating at first
Jed,still easier than snowboarding
Jed,first time I tried I spent more time on the ground than on my feet
Jed,but in general skating ignores a lot of the things you instinctively do to stay balanced
Jed,cause you can't brace yourself except sideways
Jed,that was the same with me. The only time I was actually standing was when I was hugging the wall.
Jed,skating takes time
Jed,only reason I'm any good is cause canada
Jed,lots of practice
Jed,Though I'd much rather roll skate than ice skate.
Jed,shudders
Jed,I don't like how hard it is to stop on roller skates
Jed,"stopping on roller skates is tough, but you can at least STAND on them."
Jed,it's a skill on skates -_-
Jed,its something you have to learn
Jed,but at least I know that if I'm out of control I can stop quickly

Jed,"partially built on the fact that, as a socially inept introvert, it's rare that I meet people where I can spend an evening just chilling without doing any specific activity and not feel drained or like we ran out of stuff to talk about and stuff got awkward"
Jed,and it was just a good chill happy time

Jed,
Jed,dude wtf you guys doing lol
Jed,I just watched the end of the last mafia and chillin threw so hard
Jed,he had it in the bag
Jed,and he fucked up right at the end
Jed,"also this is getting me to want to try some mafia, who'd be down to play?"
Jed,me
Jed,As am I
Jed,how many people do we need to get a proper game going?
Jed,I think somewhere in the realm of 12-14
Jed,"google says you need at least 7, 2 mafia vs 5 town"
Jed,today won't work for me though because I have 3 finals tomorrow
Jed,I think 2 vs 5 is for speed mafia without the medic cop and vigilante
Jed,I can't for the next 12 days
Jed,I mean I think you need some town roles
Jed,I feel like doing 2 mafia 4 town 1 cop would be best
Jed,Yo what about the doctor tho
Jed,eh less important imo
Jed,Let's do it when Chris gets back
Jed,Astralis got 3-0'd last night :(

Jed,zain could win this
Jed,he's beaten m2k
Jed,and if leffen makes it through he could
Jed,personally I'm hoping for m2k leffen grands
Jed,I don't think Zain has ever beaten m2k
Jed,didn't he in pools? or was that 3-2 m2k
Jed,m2k won 3-2
Jed,and he won every game in the marth ditto and 3-0ed him in a marth ditto a few tourneys ago
Jed,ah that's probably gonna be m2k's win then

Jed,Submitted
Jed,Should have been anonymous though
Jed,the name was optional
Jed,so it can be anonymous if you want
Jed,I have reason to believe someone is spamming multiple responses
Jed,Please don't ruin my poll

Jed,"I may remake it later, require authentication, and only PM it to master memers"
Jed,just delete the spam results
Jed,I'm not sure if they are spam though
Jed,someone may have just used a dumb name and responded almost exactly like another person
Jed,can we access poll results soon?

Jed,Kk

Jed,possibly not tonight
Jed,probably not tonight

Jed,I think the best absa
Jed,not sure if he is actually top 10 but really good
Jed,Lol are you gay? XD
Jed,I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEE
Jed,WOOOOO
Jed,@Max
Jed,lets play skullgirls
Jed,alright
Jed,let me go get my controller cable and refil my coffee
Jed,5 mins
Jed,andrew did you lean any combos?
Jed,"if not, max should probably play not his main"
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,buy your texas tickets big gay
Jed,!zack
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,how do you break out of combos
Jed,This game is hard
Jed,@everyone
Jed,Let's have a skill girls tournament on Saturday
Jed,I mean you don't break out of combos
Jed,but if you see this weird smoke stuff you can hit any button to burst
Jed,but htat only happens if the other person repeats the same thing too many times in the same combo
Jed,"and if me or max is comboing you, we've learned combos that don't let you break out"
Jed,
Jed,"but generally, it's not optimal to do the full combo unless it's gonna kill"
Jed,cause the longer the combo the less any individual hit does
Jed,"you ideally want to combo someone a bit, then trick them and start a new combo with fresh damage scaling"
Jed,but neither me nor max is good enough to do that yet
Jed,"also, max, did you go fukua against him? that wasn't very nice of you lol"
Jed,I only remember half the combo
Jed,I know next to nothing about any other character and didn't feel like figuring it out
Jed,@Trapezoider I'll be down for games in like an hour and a half
Jed,Hell yeah
Jed,Going to the gym will play games when I return

Jed,We are a month 10 days out. Are you going to come to Meetup?
Jed,"Like a salmon, I have returned to the land of my birth"
Jed,"hopefully, unlike a salmon, I will be neither dying nor mating here"
Jed,"also, the nearest in & out is an hour and a half walk away and I'm salty"
Jed,I might do it anyway
Jed,Welcome to America!
Jed,guys your roads are so nice
Jed,True
Jed,"If you come to the meetup you can see the widest highway in the entire world. The Katy Freeway, which is something like 16 lanes."
Jed,Depends where tho
Jed,"I mean it's more just like, they're hella smooth"
Jed,cause there aren't proper winters here
Jed,so you don't get tons of potholes
Jed,I'm not used to this
Jed,Warm climate>cold climate
Jed,"on the flip side, it's about a million degrees in my room"
Jed,and there's no AC
Jed,lemme add 'fan' to my shopping list
Jed,good idea
Jed,"once I unpacked my computer, the first thing I looked up was the nearest in and out, and the second thing was making sure the tap water is drinkable"
Jed,"priorities, motherfuckers"
Jed,"tap water: safe to drink
tap water: tastes kinda bad"
Jed,"also, your paper money sucks"
Jed,Yes

Jed,"@ americans, is jack in the box any good? I'm trying to find fast food within walking distance"
Jed,my next best option is kfc
Jed,Its decent
Jed,is kfc a better bet?
Jed,they're both meh imo
Jed,but which one is more meh
Jed,I think it depends on if you want burger or chicken
Jed,choose based on that
Jed,I mean I don't really care one way or the other?
Jed,dammit I'm trying to get you guys to make up my mind
Jed,choose jack in the box
Jed,
Jed,AAAAAAH I JUST CHECK MY INTERNET
Jed,178 mb/s down
Jed,hot damn
Jed,that's like ten times what I was getting at home
Jed,only 6 mb/s up though

Jed,Prolly kfc
Jed,ZACK I JUST REALIZED WE CAN PLAY MELEE ALL THE TIME BUDDY IM CRYI G
Jed,OUR PING IS GOING TO BE SO FUCKING GOOD 
Jed,Oh true
Jed,Can't use the ping excuse anymore

Jed,"was gonna do jack in the box, but I accidentally turned right instead of left and ended up at kfc"
Jed,and decided it was probably fate
Jed,and now I can feel like I've lived the american dream
Jed,of getting shitty service in a basically empty kfc
Jed,?

Jed,My history teacher is retarded and we have to color and label a map of every country
Jed,Every country in the entire world?
Jed,This has nothing to do with history
Jed,Yes all 206 or whatever
Jed,wow
Jed,He is just a horrible teacher who doesn't want to teach or grade anything
Jed,At least you didn't have to put a certain number of dots on each country based off it's population
Jed,That was fun
Jed,Damn
Jed,Oh Christ
Jed,Why is the education system so retarded
Jed,Nah it's just this teacher really
Jed,But I mean yeah
Jed,He doesn't even give tests it's always projects
Jed,Because we don't learn anything
Jed,good ol education system
Jed,But I go to a private school so one would expect that it'd be better but no
Jed,lol
Jed,My history teacher at the public school was a million times better

Jed,My education at a community college is 10x better than 5000 a year private school lol

Jed,Thanks I cry
Jed,@Homies do you guys wanna have a melee tournament where Zack and max can't play their mains or secondaries?
Jed,I'm down
Jed,I guess so
Jed,"Honestly, depending on skill level, you may need to ban 15+ characters"
Jed,for us
Jed,we could do it like we used to do rivals tournaments
Jed,we should do it like rivals where each person gets a certain number of bans
Jed,based on skill
Jed,great minds think alike
Jed,^
Jed,maybe I could even rope in Ava for one more
Jed,lets try and do it tonight
Jed,so do we have 4 so far?
Jed,we could maybe get up to 6
Jed,I'm curious what my ping's gonna be like to everyone
Jed,I think we'll have to except that some people will have awful ping
Jed,I'll have great ping to andrew for once
Jed,I have fine ping to the shapes so we should be okay
Jed,and jed
Jed,"also, do you want to play a bit in like an hour? I want to get a little more done but then I want a break"
Jed,I'm down
Jed,just @ me
Jed,will do
Jed,I think we can get 6 for sure
Jed,"Kameron

Jed
Ava
Fusion?
Chris?"

Jed,I'm still in Florida until next week so count me out

Jed,what is this?
Jed,Were gonna do a character crew battle

Jed,interested?
Jed,"i mean im still gonna get terrible ping, so I really should be on the other team"
Jed,@cs 1 game ?
Jed,@Zain  ?>
Jed,@Max is thing happen tonight?
Jed,no
Jed,Jed isn't here
Jed,"@Sak von Sak  Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you been watching the Persona 5 Animation? If you are, how are you enjoying it?"
Jed,it's.... mediocre
Jed,it gets the broad strokes
Jed,but the pacing's wack
Jed,really?
Jed,and it's skipped a lot of little important character moments
Jed,it's missing a lot of the charm the game had
Jed,"Well I mean, trying to crame moments into a 30 minute episode and 24 of them, I can see how the pacing can be off."
Jed,"I only saw one episode, the battle against Kamoshida (the first boss)."
Jed,I mean it's not horrible
Jed,but you'd be better off playing the game
Jed,my biggest problem is they keep cutting good character building moments
Jed,and it's persona
Jed,you can't just skip the character building
Jed,and the back-and-forth and stuff that builds the characters into a group with dynamics and stuff rather than just a bunch of characters shoved together
Jed,"also the protag is both a) bland as fuck, and b) practically non-existant as a character"
Jed,"I know they're running him from a silent protagonist in the game, but even in-game they gave him a lot more character than this"
Jed,"like, watch the p4 anime if you want to see a persona protag handled well"
Jed,"or even the p3 movies, although he's kind of an emo little shit, but at least that's actually a personality"
Jed,sorry

Jed,I got 10 days
Jed,Also more for what
Jed,Meetup
Jed,
Jed,Hey it's like frostbites 3 years anniversary
Jed,Ah
Jed,how do you know
Jed,Because I met you guys for the tf2 team 3 years ago
Jed,frostbite is a bit older than you knowing them is
Jed,frostbite was actually a bit later
Jed,but the core group was earlier
Jed,I wasn't even part of the original core group
Jed,the original team where we all met was called frostbite
Jed,thats where the name came from
Jed,I joined like... two and a half years ago?
Jed,oh huh
Jed,"so it was frostbite, then not frostbite, then frostbite again?"
Jed,yes
Jed,Frostbite>Pancake Pals>POOP>Rolo Regiment>Frostbite
Jed,I've known you guys for 3 years is what I was saying
Jed,It's my anniversary of knowing you guys
Jed,POOP?
Jed,POOP
Jed,is that an acronym?
Jed,People Order Our Patties
Jed,o h
Jed,I voted against it
Jed,its funny
Jed,that team was made of spongebob references
Jed,Man we've had a lot of good times
Jed,RIP frostbite gamers
Jed,"unrelated, but I had a dream last night that my friend (in the dream, now that I'm awake I have no idea who he was) got turned into a giant monster cause he fell into a pool of red bull and the army was after him so me and some other people took him and ran away to australia where we just kinda chilled in a hotel room and threw cookies at each other"
Jed,"also unrelated, to both the previous conversation and my previous thing, I found the best twitter: it's a bot that scrapes github for people committing stuff with swearing in it and posts them. It scratches two great itches of 1) relating to salty programmers, and 2) hilarious mixing of professional, technical writing with swearing"
Jed,for example: https://twitter.com/gitlost/status/996784597194170369
Jed,I MADE THIS SHIT TO WORK ASYNCHRONOUSLY WITH SMALL DELAYS
Jed,Make a film off of that dream please

Jed,The first frostbite discord post
Jed,Actually I feel like that's wrong my discord might be lying to me
Jed,Holy crap
Jed,My guy how long did you scroll
Jed,Lol
Jed,Remember when we used mumble
Jed,Doctors mumble server
Jed,No it was kamerons
Jed,:0
Jed,Cause it was mumble tf2
Jed,my first tf2 team still has a facebook page and it's mad nostalgic
Jed,
Jed,am just an overwatch scrub lol
Jed,I'm scrolling back through now and I found the best picture I've ever taken
Jed,Yo everyone keep sending old screenshots on getting so much nostalgia
Jed,
Jed,This is the beginning of my server
Jed,what about the OG frostbite?
Jed,I left that server :0
Jed,Why
Jed,@Bitmin
Jed,esea
Jed,im only back now and a bit later
Jed,That was a good nostalgia trip
Jed,^
Jed,Man I remember mumble
Jed,I honestly dont really remember mumble
Jed,discord is so much better
Jed,I remember I hated discord whnr it came out
Jed,Mumbles interface was terrible
Jed,Discord is a huge step up
Jed,I don't know how we used it for so long
Jed,"If we've known Trap for 3 years, does that mean we've known each other for 4? @Max @Mr. Airplane"
Jed,"no, its been 3 years for us"
Jed,around 2 and a half for him
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,September 25 is the earliest thing I can find in Monday night super slammed whatever
Jed,Of 2015
Jed,Kameron Chris and I were on a team before that
Jed,it formed in May 2015
Jed,^
Jed,
Jed,I joined early 2016 if I remember correctly
Jed,Chikon nd the cock fighters right
Jed,Or rolo regiment
Jed,Right?
Jed,rolo regiment
Jed,not even the weirdest team name I've played for
Jed,that probably goes to 'It's Raining Minh'
Jed,HA
Jed,Was the leader Chinese?
Jed,not even
Jed,the story goes a little like this:
Jed,"there was a team, with some normal name"
Jed,their medic was this guy who went by minh
Jed,and they had some weird in-joke about 'minh advantage'
Jed,"eventually, said team disbanded, and a few people got together to make a new team, which was called minh advantage"
Jed,"that team also broke up, and a new subset of that team, containing a few people from the original team whose name I don't remember, made another new team, minh advantage II"
Jed,which is when I joined
Jed,"then there was some upheaval with a patch that messed with demo and heavy a bit and like, half the team quit"
Jed,"it was then patched up with some teammates from my first tf2 team and some tryouts, and rechristened It's Raining Minh"
Jed,and we went on to make playoffs
Jed,and then disband
Jed,You should make a movie out of that
Jed,I'm now wondering if some people from it's raining minh went on to make another team with a name containing minh
Jed,"also, as It's Raining Minh our team tag was a little umbrella that is for some reason an accepted unicode character"
Jed,@Melee anyone want to play for a bit?
Jed,yes
Jed,I can't talk tho
Jed,k
Jed,@Melee I am unsatiated
Jed,why?
Jed,cause kameron has to go

Jed,"@Sak von Sak  I got a Persona 5 question, since you're the wizard at this stuff. Someone I watch on Youtube was describing anime characters in 4 seconds and someone gave him Morgana and he said ""IT'S TIME TO GO TO FREAKIN' SLEEP!"" how does that describe Morgana?"
Jed,@Bitmin wanna csgo?
Jed,Oh jeez I have not slept in a couple day but I'll play 1 game give me a couple mins
Jed,oh ok
Jed,pfffft yeah
Jed,it's a meme
Jed,that you probably won't experience in the show
Jed,"but basically at the end of days in-game, sometimes based on events during the day you can't go out or anything, but the game still gives you some control over your character"
Jed,but if you try to leave
Jed,Morgana: You look tired. You should get some sleep.
Jed,it's an integral part of the p5 experience

Jed,Whoever made that should be arrested by the CDC for causing a health disaster
Jed,@Weeb
Jed,so my hero academia is a good show
Jed,nice
Jed,"I won't deny that, it's just personally doesn't appeal to me."
Jed,yee that show's awesome
Jed,how far in are you?
Jed,4 episodes
Jed,I watched it this morning
Jed,I may be sleep deprived but I teared up a little bit 
Jed,I think I'm gay 
Jed,Crying as a man doesn't mean you're gay
Jed,but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
Jed,
Jed,who said I'm gay?
Jed,literally nobody
Jed,^ we were talking about me
Jed,"well when he said
but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
after my comment, I thought he was talking about me"
Jed,Nah he's saying I'm gay
Jed,
Jed,"well like I said, crying as a man doesn't mean your gay."
Jed,you are of hte gay andrew
Jed,Snap
Jed,I thought I liked girls
Jed,"In fact, it shows that you're a true man as true men know how to express their feelings"
Jed,^^^ true brother
Jed,"and besides, you're not gay in my book unless you're making out with dudes."
Jed,bruh i feel like you can still make out with dudes and not be gay
Jed,aslong as your socks are on
Jed,"if you were forced, maybe."
Jed,"like if my LIFE or something VERY precious to me was on the line, I'd probably do it. But otherwise, nuh uh!"
Jed,Compelled homosexuality
Jed,like if some dude came up to me  and offered me $20 to make out with him id probably do it so i see where you're coming from mrd256
Jed,"I wouldn't do it for $20, unless I was desperate."
Jed,i am
Jed,you're broke then
Jed,College
Jed,"eh, makes sense"
Jed,"I could get two extra large pepperoni pizzas for $20

I would give a guy a quick peck on the lips for two extra large pepperoni pizzas, especially in this situation where there's clearly no expectations of anything beyond that. I'm not desperate or broke, I just really like pizza."
Jed,with $20 i can buy literally 60 packs of ramen
Jed,thats lunch for 2 months
Jed,ramen in America is unhealthy you now that.
Jed,"like, extremely"
Jed,clearly you don't understand university living
Jed,it's far more healthy to eat ramen every day for lunch
Jed,than to not eat lunch
Jed,^
Jed,fucking
Jed,preach
Jed,"Well I'm not in collage or live by my self yet, so maybe it don't."
Jed,but the pizzas though
Jed,"And while ramen is not good for you, it is better than not eating anything. Doesn't make it healthier tho"
Jed,at the end of the day I think it comes down to priorities: there's not much on that level of harmlessness that I wouldn't do for $20
Jed,"Listen, $20 is $20"
Jed,^
Jed,@Cs:go gamezzzzzzzz
Jed,Ya boi sold his car
Jed,Firebird incoming
Jed,Prolly
Jed,proud of you dad
Jed,take me for a ride

Jed,not even my fault. 2 tonne car with no handling thats 25 years old
Jed,
Jed,Well the Firebirds are also 20+ years old
Jed,"but are high performance sports cars designed for optimal control and speed balance. Im so excited for you though, youre going to be boolin   and impressin all kinds of ladies"

Jed,"@Zack  So I was playing Persona 5 and I think I noticed an animation error in one of the cutscenes. This is the beach scene. Yusuke holds up his hands like he's trying to picture something in the next shot his hands are like backwards? Thought you might find this interesting.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449728861484220416/unknown.png
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449729119408619551/unknown.png"
Jed,lol I never noticed that
Jed,probably just a laziness thing
Jed,I was probably a little too busy cracking up at the towel thing
Jed,"It's just something funny that caught my eye.
Yeah, the towel thing was funny too."
Jed,"Tho one of the highlights for me in this scene, was the protagonist actually speaking an actual line. Just based on his battle quotes, I think they choose a great english VA for him, but he doesn't speak enough, even during battle."
Jed,"If there is a Persona 5 animation dub, I'd watch it just to hear his VA in full."
Jed,Xander Mobus
Jed,he's the announcer guy for sm4sh
Jed,and they picked him for basically just yelling names again
Jed,good pick
Jed,honestly the english cast for p5 is all damn good except maybe haru
Jed,"yeah, I think his voice fits him."
Jed,Haru... eh she's okay.
Jed,her voice was annoying at first but it grew on me
Jed,that's kinda the way it is will all really high-pitched girls
Jed,eh not always
Jed,but yeah pretty often
Jed,"Honestly, I wasn't too big a fan of Makoto's VA. Not that she was a bad actress, but the fact that her voice didn't really suit her. But that's me"
Jed,I am incredibly biased towards her voice actress because she's done a ton of roles I've loved
Jed,so I felt like it worked
Jed,but that might just be me
Jed,But the one VA I like out of them all is Morgana's. Cassandra Morris is one of my most favorite dub voice actresses
Jed,She had me terrified
Jed,you can't put kyubey's voice in a cutesy animal sidekick
Jed,you just can't do that
Jed,that's not ok
Jed,"Well, I don't really know who Kyubey is... but I like her because of some other roles she's done."
Jed,"And Morgana is not a ""Cutesy"" animal sidekick!"
Jed,"@ anyone who's watched madoka magica, confirm that you would be scared to hear his voice coming out of any cutesy animal sidekick"
Jed,"also, aesthetically, definitely cutesy"
Jed,"personality-wise, not as much"
Jed,I'll give you that
Jed,"also, you've finished p4, right?"
Jed,"I didn't play it, but I've watched the anime. But I did finish the anime"
Jed,"for p4, I correctly predicted the villain by their voice actor, cause I was like 'there is no way they would hire a voice actor this good at sounding badass and evil and give him to that derpy a character.'"
Jed,so I was never not suspicious of morgana
Jed,I'm not telling you if I was right or not
Jed,but I was scared from start to finish
Jed,"Most of the roles I know Morgana's VA from are all protagonist characters or sub characters. Nothing evil about them. Also, she was in p4's anime"
Jed,p4 had the weirdest voice cast
Jed,@Mr. Airplane show us your graduation pics or it's fake
Jed,"50% amazing, 50% terrible"
Jed,"Yeah, the only VAs I liked in p4 were Yu, Yosuke, Kanji, and Rise"
Jed,that would pretty much be their big-name voice actors in the main cast
Jed,yep
Jed,"Johnny Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker/Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey"
Jed,and then a bunch of mediocre people
Jed,and then some big names for tiny roles
Jed,that pretty much sums it up
Jed,"p5 has the best overall cast, p3 had a solid one with a few big problems"
Jed,it starts off so strong
Jed,"Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Vic Mignogna, Tara Platt, Liam O'Brian"
Jed,and then Fuuka shows up
Jed,heh
Jed,I didn't know Michelle Ruff and Liam O'Brian were in p3. Did Michelle voice Yukari?
Jed,"yeah, and Liam O'Brian did Akihiko"
Jed,Ah! I was thinking Akihiko was Josh Grelle.
Jed,"and Yukari is possibly my favorite Persona girl so far.
and my favorite Persona character period is possibly Akechi from p5"
Jed,"I Really like that sadistic and psychotic type of villian, especially where they look so innocent to begin with."
Jed,I always kinda figured he was gonna turn out evil
Jed,I just didn't realize... how evil
Jed,when he snaps he snaps
Jed,and his voice actor does an amazing job of it too
Jed,"He was like one of the main antagonists, next to Shido and the final boss"
Jed,yeah he does
Jed,and he was definitely the most interesting antagonist
Jed,true that

Jed,especially when their rooms contain the only bathrooms

Jed,Sorry about to play a game of civ 5
Jed,training session?
Jed,DO YOU MEAN
Jed,MELEE
Jed,ill play
Jed,melee isnt fun with such high ping because high ping buffs you as a player and nerfs me. I will fight you when I am in texas and our ping is better
Jed,honestly high ping usually hurts the stronger player
Jed,"you can't combo as hard, or be as precise in neutral"
Jed,"no johns, andrew"
Jed,@Trapezoider Civ game isn't happening I can play now
Jed,youre wrong in this case zack
Jed,Kameron has no movement ability and little tech skill
Jed,he still has combos and neutral
Jed,My playstyle revolves around getting grabs and spacing around my opponent
Jed,which are far more affected
Jed,When I have 120 ping
Jed,"@Sak von Sak When your entire punish game is being good at tech chasing, high ping hurts a lot"
Jed,wavedashing because impossible
Jed,I guess
Jed,which is the case for trap
Jed,"also wavedashing and most tech is muscle memory, ping shouldn't matter"
Jed,It does matter because it changes the timing
Jed,Milliseconds matter
Jed,"a wavedash is the same input, you just have to do it ever so slightly earlier"
Jed,no different than any other input

Jed,It would be awesome if we could get that many teams
Jed,50 50 split would be more fun imo
Jed,nah
Jed,We shall vote
Jed,then it would all end in 1 fight
Jed,good point
Jed,"with smaller teams, the fights will be more spread out"
Jed,but if someone dies super early thats so lame
Jed,and 2v1 comebacks are much more possible than like 2v6
Jed,They can spectate
Jed,pvp gives me depression
Jed,that's sometimes almost as fun as playing
Jed,no it aint
Jed,We will be having a grace period
Jed,everyone will be safe for some amount of time
Jed,trap team with me pls
Jed,@Trapezoider
Jed,@Trapezoider I'll need to go over some standard rules to prevent stalling before we play
Jed,ye youre my team
Jed,aavaaa
Jed,Max make the rules and put them in the Realm channel
Jed,someone stop letting max make the rules
Jed,no mining?
Jed,tf?
Jed,These are standard rules
Jed,without them it is impossible to find anyone
Jed,no Branch minding Devin!
Jed,All major UHC games follow that rule
Jed,wow you're supposed to be my main man matt but you dont even know how to spell my name
Jed,"first of all, I'm not your bud.
second, is it Kevin or Devin? you keep changing it"
Jed,first of all
Jed,i am your bud
Jed,second of all
Jed,kevin is my persona my irl name has always been Devon
Jed,no one likes u kevn
Jed,
Jed,"@Max  I say Nether should be allowed, but only for Blaze Rods."
Jed,also... I'm not sure about enchanting
Jed,The point of banning the nether is so you can't hide in it
Jed,agree no nether
Jed,hmm that's a good point.
Jed,I would like no enchanting
Jed,"Also, is this team based or no?"
Jed,@Trapezoider hey fucker
Jed,"The reason for the nether, diamond, and enchantment bans is to try and speed up the game by vastly reducing the amount of time people need to spend gathering resources."
Jed,"Not sure if everyone wants this, but I think it would be more fun."
Jed,is this team based or no?
Jed,We are planning on having teams
Jed,ok
Jed,I say we have a grace period until the end of the first Minecraft day
Jed,day or day and night?
Jed,from sunrise Day 1 to sunrise day 2
Jed,day and night
Jed,I mean we could always just go off of the honour system to not hide
Jed,there are some people on here I don't trust to do that
Jed,Also we could say that after x amount of time we get teleported to spawn to finish so it doesn't last forever
Jed,"Even with no hiding, by banning these things we will reduce the amount of time needed to acquire maximum strength gear"
Jed,I trust everyone here
Jed,points to Devin
Jed,"That is my main reason, not to prevent hiding."
Jed,@Jed
Jed,why did you hey fucker
Jed,Whats up
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,can you take a break to join for the realms thing big guy?
Jed,in like an hour
Jed,I don't think he owns Minecraft
Jed,really? I thought he was there last time we made a realm
Jed,"I mean, I don't think banning things like diamonds and the nether are gonna be fun. I think you should be able to use whatever you find"
Jed,at least allow diamonds
Jed,We can discuss this in detail when we decide the final rules later.
Jed,but then ppl will spend forever looking for them and thats boring
Jed,^^^^
Jed,"also, if we're doing custom terrain, we can lower diamond spawn rates making it harder to get them"
Jed,That would lead to even more time farming though
Jed,Not if you can't strip mine. People will have to leave their caves eventually
Jed,
Jed,I'm not for lowering the rates of ores
Jed,Kinda lame
Jed,only diamond
Jed,just diamonds
Jed,Still
Jed,If anything make them more common
Jed,Lowering diamonds makes others more common?
Jed,"No, I mean make diamonds more common so you don't have to spend as long searching for them."
Jed,but then everyone will have diamond gear
Jed,so?
Jed,well I guess that's fair kinda fair...
Jed,makes fights last longer
Jed,true
Jed,yeah
Jed,We could also give everyone 20 hearts with commands
Jed,You guys want that?
Jed,I like that
Jed,ye
Jed,Keep figuring this out and tell me what to do when we start
Jed,Are we gonna have a world border?
Jed,of course
Jed,Can we do a shrinking border then?
Jed,are we playing on the latest snap shot or 1.12?
Jed,"@Trapezoider If you want this to go more smoothly, be sure to make me an OP on your new server"
Jed,"can we make a rule that if someone dies randomly from falling they can come back to life, I feel like that is going to happen and it will be super lame"
Jed,No
Jed,That won't happen
Jed,no
Jed,it might
Jed,Just don't die from fall damage
Jed,Easy
Jed,yeah
Jed,^
Jed,its no t
Jed,just watch what you're doing at all times
Jed,>.>
Jed,I'm planning on having health regen on by the way
Jed,Survival of the fittest mother fucker
Jed,Having it off penalizes you for taking fights
Jed,so are we playing in the latest snapshot or 1.12?
Jed,I would say 1.12
Jed,"well hold on, I want to check if 1.13 is out, I don't think it is... but I want to check"
Jed,it is on pre-release
Jed,will that do? or still on 1.12?
Jed,@Max
Jed,Whatever the realm allows for
Jed,what time are we starting?
Jed,After the Sony E3 event
Jed,not sure when that is
Jed,ask Andrew
Jed,I'm just going to be here
Jed,@Trapezoider  what time is Sony E3 over?
Jed,idk
Jed,im not watching it
Jed,Can you declare a start time then? Otherwise it will be left ambiguous and it will never happen.
Jed,Sony ends at 10 ish
Jed,What time zone?
Jed,est
Jed,Est
Jed,so in about an hour

Jed,i sudokued
Jed,On purpose
Jed,"Kameron pulled a hunger games move, except he wasn't one of the last two people alive"
Jed,yeah
Jed,whats the zombie swarm mechanic?
Jed,Hitting zombies spawns more zombies
Jed,More smash 5 on stream
Jed,That are aggro on you
Jed,smash 5 stylistically looks much more developed than 4
Jed,I agree
Jed,The game looks good
Jed,it looks visually complete
Jed,this game suz
Jed,Let's hope it feels good
Jed,worse than maxs retard fort
Jed,smash 4 just was missing some stuff visually
Jed,so is this game
Jed,:/
Jed,Andrew how does this game look bad?
Jed,It looks worse than jeds beard
Jed,H
Jed,O
Jed,W
Jed,F
Jed,Also I was part of the retard fort too
Jed,yea
Jed,Don't just throw Max under the bus
Jed,Thanks buddy
Jed,I gotchu
Jed,Who ever is playing pac man right now sucks real bad
Jed,Yo what are the command seals in fate zero
Jed,im confused
Jed,They allow you to give your servant a command that they cannot refuse regardless of how they personally feel about the order
Jed,HOw many times can you USE them
Jed,3
Jed,Ohhhh
Jed,Why are they using items on this stream
Jed,cause it's the casual stream
Jed,yo the tipper caused the slowmo

Jed,Former rocket scientist
Jed,Feelsbad
Jed,f
Jed,he said the devs are still making changes
Jed,Maybe there is hope
Jed,Feedback from melee players will hopefully help
Jed,well I've lost all interest in this game
Jed,knockback looks so wack
Jed,you fly super far super fast and then just stop
Jed,that's gonna mess with combos pretty hard I'm guessing
Jed,"no ledge hog, no wave stuff, same top tier as smash 4, no  dash dance, resident sleeper"
Jed,fingers crossed for it improving in the interm
Jed,cause they'll probably get a lot of feedback from the competitive people who want some changes
Jed,yes and nintendo will TOTALLY listen to that /s
Jed,shhh let me live in my happy little bubble
Jed,ok sorry
Jed,this is pretty cringe
Jed,I use that word sparingly
Jed,"desk guy: ""everyone's hoping for that 7th map""
the entire chat: ""4-0 pls"""
Jed,"If the numbers each character was given in the smash 5 trailer corresponds to the order they were created (which I think they said was the case), then the long held theory of roy and game and watch being created last and being incomplete has finally been confirmed."
Jed,2-2 rip
Jed,resident sleeper
Jed,I'm reading reddit and people seem to think that ledge hogging in a game is bad and I honestly don't understand why
Jed,it literally doubles the amount of ways that you can feasibly kill your opponent and thus makes the game more interesting and complex
Jed,what's even the point of ledges if they don't do anything?
Jed,it begins

Jed,Where is it at

Jed,Nintendo @ E3: Day 1
Jed,lol already we've got mango chants
Jed,crowd chanting mango
Jed,mango chant
Jed,lol
Jed,we all thought the same thing
Jed,were they not allowed to wear their team's jerseys?
Jed,prolly not cause it's pure nintendo sponsored
Jed,also why is vish's mic so quiet
Jed,Vish's mic is broken I think
Jed,I think we are hearing auditorium speaker audio through the other people's mics
Jed,This better be 1v1s
Jed,why wouldnt it be?
Jed,oh well nevermind
Jed,The smash 4 invitational was 4 player ffa
Jed,this is actually a pretty neat format
Jed,zero armada is probably a busted team tho
Jed,not really
Jed,They have the smash ball on
Jed,I mean the bracket format
Jed,^
Jed,of dubs -> singles
Jed,cringey announcer
Jed,funnyskit tho
Jed,I figured armada would pick pokemon trainer because he really likes ivysaur
Jed,cheering for zero armada
Jed,you can act out of airdodge
Jed,it's got some lag tho
Jed,that map was wack
Jed,oh they play one map
Jed,lol 2nd at evo 2017... someone's got their info wrong
Jed,"2015, yes, 2017 no"
Jed,unlucky
Jed,bayo looks more reasonable now
Jed,he stuff's got more knockback
Jed,you know the slowmo prolly makes it really easy to di
Jed,but you still CAN do the old combos but it's way harder
Jed,hopefully you can turn slowmo off
Jed,"also, while there's no lcancelling it looks like you've got way less landing lag on stuff"
Jed,I might main bayo
Jed,its a consideration
Jed,They haven't even shown how each character plays yet
Jed,My list of potential mains is rather long
Jed,Just because they were good in smash 4 doesn't really mean they will continue to be good with all these new characters
Jed,True beans
Jed,there are only 2 new characters
Jed,Still more characters than smash 4
Jed,Things can change
Jed,They only have access to 30 characters right now
Jed,hbox v reggie again
Jed,LETS GET SOME 1V1
Jed,Random cosplayers?
Jed,wutface
Jed,Obese Ness lol
Jed,they're all fat]
Jed,Wtf
Jed,Ness is sweatin'
Jed,Lucky thought that game was a ffa match LOLOLOL
Jed,He was attacking Mr. R on purpose
Jed,derp
Jed,wat
Jed,the legend
Jed,Lol
Jed,zero's prolly got this in the bag
Jed,Where's the Charizard
Jed,pokemon trainer looks kinda neat tho
Jed,I think if you work out the changes mid-combo 'n stuff you've got some tricks
Jed,This doesn't look that good
Jed,armada didn't really do anything with it tho
Jed,also ike looks sick
Jed,he's so fast
Jed,F MangO
Jed,mewtwo's sooo fast
Jed,hot damn
Jed,that was actually pretty good
Jed,and they were using wavelands and stuff
Jed,My man plup
Jed,I have faith in this game being good
Jed,is this genesis?
Jed,Items 
Jed,I mean yeah the items were a bit weird
Jed,THAT AINT ZELDA
Jed,but the standard play was legit
Jed,It looked real nice
Jed,I want to see the finals
Jed,Snake vs Sheik
Jed,sure the combos aren't stellar but it looks like it's got setups and such that you didn't have as much in sm4sh
Jed,hopefully no items
Jed,that was actually pretty hype at the end
Jed,like you've got post-combo positioning setups that look real good
Jed,WHY
Jed,this is so pointless
Jed,shhh
Jed,it's pandering to hte casuals
Jed,"Pointless, unless they bring out actual people"
Jed,who are these people??
Jed,Who are these people?
Jed,Who TF???
Jed,I mean there was an ign person
Jed,but I dunno
Jed,these are pretty meh vips
Jed,just give me reggie vs hbox
Jed,^
Jed,Tfw they play DK crew song when a big black guy comes on stage 
Jed,i know blacknerdcomedy has a youtube
Jed,which is quite popular
Jed,well  its already over
Jed,that kyogre sweep lol
Jed,I think Zelda and Sheik are the same character again
Jed,they said no
Jed,they showed up as different characters in the initial intro
Jed,The girl's name is Zelda
Jed,Not the character
Jed,I see
Jed,"remeber kids, Animal Crossing teaches you that Taxation is theft"
Jed,sheik looks really fun
Jed,COMBOS
Jed,OMG
Jed,yo that was nutty
Jed,Sheik looks really fun
Jed,That was insane
Jed,they both look super fun
Jed,Dang
Jed,actual combos
Jed,MKleo dropped the ball
Jed,also snake's uptilt's the same lol
Jed,i already said both those things max
Jed,naw that was honestly all zero
Jed,he's a sneaky bastard
Jed,it's nuts
Jed,The set up from snake in the beginning of the final stock
Jed,This game looks dope
Jed,wait is there rage?
Jed,I actually want a switch now
Jed,yeah :(
Jed,rip
Jed,if the game's this intense day 1 I'm looking forward to it
Jed,rage is actually the most dumb mechanic
Jed,like sure there's some clear similarities to sm4sh so people get a head start but still
Jed,yeah rage is weird
Jed,rage?
Jed,"higher your %, more knockback"
Jed,ah
Jed,makes it super hard to kill when you're at low % and easy to make comebacks
Jed,and also hard to combo low % people when you're at high %
Jed,How did MKLeo all 3 of those characters
Jed,I mean
Jed,2 smash 4 top tiers and snake
Jed,or it makes it easier to roll your opponent @Sak von Sak
Jed,"it seems like it was gonna make heavies really good cause they can live to high percents and kill before other people get to high, but heavies still kinda sucked"
Jed,yeah that too
Jed,Bay Vs. Ride mhmmm
Jed,wtf is that down B!?!
Jed,wait wat
Jed,how did he die at 17%
Jed,items LOL
Jed,lol
Jed,lol bayo
Jed,fuck
Jed,Bayo needs to be nerfed
Jed,she's back
Jed,FML
Jed,She looks kind of fun not gonna lie
Jed,true
Jed,she's just old dumb bayo
Jed,gimme interesting bayo
Jed,not the same combo
Jed,although that might have been partially just ridley being huge
Jed,^ yeah
Jed,but sstill
Jed,that was hella dumb
Jed,bigger hitbox = easy combo
Jed,still the fact that she can do that to anyone is depressing
Jed,she is just dumb combo
Jed,Hype best of 3
Jed,maybe 2 sets
Jed,tfw WWE super star and it is not John Cena
Jed,oh hype spirit tracks music
Jed,I think
Jed,LOL WUT
Jed,nairo with a bunch of scrubs?
Jed,this is gonna be a slaughter
Jed,Nairo about to destroy some noobs
Jed,who allowed this
Jed,lololol
Jed,Secretly pro players
Jed,he's still gonna slaughter em
Jed,Lol
Jed,3 v 1 
Jed,3v1
Jed,items and no team attack might swing it a bit
Jed,this is great
Jed,Can Nairo do it?
Jed,no
Jed,Nairo is about to get raped
Jed,he can but it'll be tough
Jed,items are good
Jed,he's one of the best sm4sh players
Jed,like the big three are zero mkleo and him
Jed,SNAKE!?!
Jed,also nairo's got a chance cause I think he just needs the most kills total
Jed,the crowd is singing the DK RAP LOL
Jed,i thought its was stocks ez for nairo
Jed,the taunt combo
Jed,poggers
Jed,what a god
Jed,+30 win inbound
Jed,
Jed,picking a heavy was pretty smart
Jed,I want to see the score ffs
Jed,Finally no items
Jed,or smash balls
Jed,and best of 3
Jed,lets go
Jed,mildly serious match
Jed,and a real stage
Jed,zero playing smash 4 lol
Jed,
Jed,bayo's not as busted hurray
Jed,it was just ridley being massive
Jed,I'm glad the neutral b has more knockback tho cause it suuuucked before
Jed,good balancing act
Jed,The bullets?
Jed,yeah
Jed,bullets were as if fox had 2 guns
Jed,is MkLeo going to de throne ZeRo?
Jed,dunno if really counts as a dethroning
Jed,zero's been retired
Jed,true
Jed,how old is ZeRo
Jed,?
Jed,mid twenties I think?
Jed,mkleo's like seventeen tho
Jed,he is 23
Jed,just found it online
Jed,the end of a pro gamer age is around 23-25 apparently
Jed,Why does Mario have no moves with Cappy? 
Jed,cause then he would be garbage lol
Jed,unless they were to make it like link's boomerang
Jed,I mean there's a lot of smashers over 25
Jed,most good csgo players are > 25
Jed,zero didnt permenantly retire
Jed,Why did he retire?
Jed,stress
Jed,the Brain in the Human body starts to decline brain activity around 25 and onward
Jed,It may not be this case
Jed,thats not true
Jed,excuse me?
Jed,Do you really want to do this over the knowledge of the human body?
Jed,the reason most esports players retire is burnout not physical decline
Jed,"After 25 your reaction time, multitasking capability and and memory begin to slip."
Jed,"Mario vs. Sonic
ResidentSleeper"
Jed,Where's your source?
Jed,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319185.php
Jed,What happens to the brain as we age?
Jed,The brain begins to decline with age. We examine what happens to the brain over time and whether the rate of decline can be slowed or even prevented.

Jed,How Your Brain Changes With Age
Jed,"Take control of your brain health by learning about how your brain changes as you age, and techniques to stay sharp."
Jed,Not like it matters cause when I showed you sources before you did not take it seriously anyways lol
Jed,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19542656/your-brain-as-you-age/
Jed,Has Your Brain Already Peaked?
Jed,New research from MIT suggests that mental decline begins far younger than is typically thought
Jed,anyways
Jed,YAY ZeRo!
Jed,yeah but neither of those things is super important for smash
Jed,and it's such a slow decline at first
Jed,that experience is more important
Jed,"like, there's street fighter players in their 30's"
Jed,"very true, exactly"
Jed,wow daigo is 37
Jed,I didn't realize he was that old
Jed,people with higher still take longer to age
Jed,the age of retirement for both sports and esports is getting higher and higher
Jed,so it the age of how long people live
Jed,your point?
Jed,federer is almost 37 and he still dominates when he is playing well
Jed,that is my point
Jed,i was just noting something interesting
Jed,is he a very high skilled player?
Jed,like Top teir?
Jed,leffen on the right
Jed,both players me and kameron have mentioned are old and still top 5 in their respective (e)sports
Jed,then it is a correlation between the amount of skill the person has and the rate that the skill of a person declines. All I was saying is that the decline starts at the approximate age of 25. nothing else.
Jed,you said their careers are basically over at 25
Jed,which is provably not true
Jed,hell it should be even worse in sports cause your physical skills also decline but it's still entirely possible to keep at it
Jed,"I said ""the end"" not drop dead over  or done."
Jed,The ending of a carrer does not have to be a drop dead date just a time period
Jed,Is anything else happening today or is that it?
Jed,I thought we were getting some sort of reveal
Jed,Stream went dark
Jed,F
Jed,Is it over then?
Jed,weird ass ending

if list is sorted
    return list
else
    destroy the universe"

Jed,In a lil bit
Jed,Tfw when you knock yourself out by standing up too quick and hitting the open cash register
Jed,Gg
Jed,@Max where you at homie
Jed,@Homies my parents dont think I should use the PC tonight
Jed,Because concussion
Jed,how bad is it?
Jed,It's extra strong yeet 90%
Jed,@Jed if you see Astoria at camp tell her she's a crazy bitch
Jed,How did you get that diagnosed already?
Jed,"Didnt actually. ER wait times were a few hours so I yoted home. I feel better though. Might be something minor, I did black  out though LOL"
Jed,Hours long wait times at the ER sounds dangerous
Jed,you get bumped at ER based on seriousness of your condition
Jed,"hence how that time I thought I might have broken my wrist, I was in a nearly empty ER and still had a super long wait casue people with more pressing stuff kept showing up"
Jed,"also, be very careful about concussions, if it's not feeling better tomorrow get it checked out"
Jed,"cause they can cause serious long-term problems, especially if you don't realize you have one"
Jed,@Trapezoider
Jed,I am going to see my actual doctor tomorrow
Jed,@Sak von Sak when did you break your wrist
Jed,"I didn't, but I did do a decent amount of damage"
Jed,in an entertainly stupid sequence of events
Jed,"my house is near the top of a hill, and me and my brother decided it'd be fun to go down the hill on these -"
Jed,"together, holding on to one another"
Jed,m
Jed,or
Jed,on
Jed,and taking turns throwing the other person further down to pick up speed
Jed,and then their extra speed would be a boost to the other person
Jed,"basically we eventually messed up, I hit a lawn, flew over it onto the sidewalk, and caught all my weight on a bad angle on my wrist"
Jed,"it didn't break, but I messed up the bone and the connective tissue and stuff"
Jed,hurt like hell
Jed,and I was still in a sling/brace for a few weeks
Jed,sylki
Jed,you are a god damned legend
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,help us find your island
Jed,we are finna tryna connect it
Jed,There's a nether portal to it
Jed,through my portal?
Jed,yeah but we wanna railway
Jed,Look at the coordinates
Jed,"pffft today I learned that there's a speedrunning category for ocarina of time called ""dank percent"" where the goal is to get off a bug that makes it look like link is smoking a giant blunt as fast as you can"
Jed,yee
Jed,and it's officially recognized on speedrun.com
Jed,world record at just over eight and a half minutes
Jed,I'm just skimming the other officially recognized categories for this game and some are hilarious
Jed,"like ""Go Home and Die %"", where the goal is to die while inside a house as fast as possible"
Jed,What is the record for that one?
Jed,8m18s
Jed,there's also a category to complete the game without ever opening any doors
Jed,"there's a category to complete the game all the way to the water temple, and then while inside get to a total of 37 small keys"
Jed,@Sak von Sak have you seen full metal alchemist
Jed,he thinks its overrated
Jed,i think zacks overrated
Jed,ava sums it up nicely
Jed,"it's a solid show, but beyond the first chunk I felt like it just gets larger, more unweildy, and slower, and nothing it does beyond a few early bits really stood out to me"
Jed,it just feels like a decently executed generic show that gets worse as it goes on
Jed,"I agree, full metal alchemist is overrated."
Jed,"I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it, at least not before a lot of other things"
Jed,Especially brotherhood.
Jed,"I haven't seen the original, but from what I've heard, it's even more filled with fluff"
Jed,I'm one of those people who doesn't watch main stream anime. I stick to the more lesser know stuff.
Jed,"And to me, (a true anime fan), main stream animes are just... Not good animes."
Jed,how do you define a true anime fan
Jed,?
Jed,A true anime fan is someone who enjoys other animes then mainstream.
Jed,"I would have gone with just ""a person who enjoys anime, regardless of other peoples' opinions of any given anime"""
Jed,"Also, I feel like to be a true anime fan, you have to watch at least 5 different animes that aren't mainstream."
Jed,also just in general I feel like there's literally no reason to subdivide a community and it'll only cause problems and toxicity and elitism
Jed,both of those defintion are super arbitrary
Jed,being a fan should be whatever you think it is
Jed,True.
Jed,I'm only saying what I define it as for myself
Jed,idk i just find the gate keeping shit to be really autistic
Jed,"@mrd256  stop being an elitist, that is so stupid. Anyone who says you have to watch non-mainstream anime to be a ""true anime fan"" is just trying way too hard to look cool and feel above other people. It literally doesn't matter at all. You're not special because you watch things that less people think are good. Get off your high horse."
Jed,"Also, as someone who had an obsession with Yu-gi-oh for years you have no right to try to be cool lol"
Jed,"on another note you said watch five anime that aren't mainstream. FIVE???? That's it? If you want to go on about ""true anime fans"" it should at least be someone who has seen a heck of a lot of anime. My list is up in the 80's (which isn't even all that much). Beat that, rookie."
Jed,Who said I only watched five?
Jed,"okay hot shot, how much anime have you watched?"
Jed,but honestly it doesn't even matter
Jed,people are entitled to like whatever anime they like and I think all people's opinions are equally valid because they're just opinions about stupid entertainment media and it doesn't matter
Jed,and this is coming from someone who has watch both mainstream and non-mainstream anime
Jed,"@Feral Nebula It's probably not as much as you, but I have watched more than 5
Owari no Seraph
Ore no Twintail narimasu
Kissxsis
High School DXD
Date A Live
Angel Beats
Charlotte
Erased (even though I hated it)
Fuuka 
Rakudai kishi no Cavalry
Miira no Kaitaka
The Devil is a part timer
Shinmai Maou no Testament
Caligula
and I can list more if I need to"
Jed,I didn't need a list lol
Jed,you asked for it
Jed,that's only 14 lol
Jed,and isn't Kissxsis an incest anime ???
Jed,still more than 5!
Jed,isn't it hentai?
Jed,but it's a gulty pleasure
Jed,pffft
Jed,no it's not a hentai
Jed,I stay away from hentai at all costs
Jed,okay buddy
Jed,also tbh most of those anime ARE mainstream. Maybe not as mainstream as naruto or FMAB but they are still well known. And the ones that aren't on your list are just plain bad lol
Jed,well yeah
Jed,then what kinda point are you tryna prove ????
Jed,"big animes like Naruto, One Piece, Boku no Hero Academia, FLCL, and others of such are ones I try to stay away from"
Jed,FLCL????
Jed,is that mainstream??
Jed,the new series
Jed,I forget what it's called.
Jed,I know what you're talking about but that anime is not mainstream as much as naruto ect.
Jed,"whatever, believe what you want to believe"
Jed,lol okay
Jed,have fun thinking you're cooler than you are
Jed,the real answer is none of us are cool because we all watch anime
Jed,coming from a girl says she's a weeboo
Jed,"I just called myself uncool too, you know"
Jed,but the weeb thing is a joke. I'm not the actual definition of a weeaboo
Jed,I never said I was cool. I was just trying to say I don't like to watch (many) mainstream animes
Jed,"right, but when people are being elitist they are trying to make themselves look higher than others"
Jed,"""a true anime fan"""
Jed,I'm just trying to say that is a toxic mindset
Jed,I didn't say I was the only one
Jed,I didn't say you said that wym ???
Jed,throws arms in the air and gives up
Jed,later
Jed,haha
Jed,I'm so amused
Jed,"slides back in briefly
in all fairness, as much as the 'true anime fan' thing is often toxic and elitest, the majority of the toxicity and elitism in this conversation is coming from ava"
Jed,"so get off yo high horse, ava"
Jed,whaaaaat
Jed,Im not ! !
Jed,   thank you Zack!
Jed,people who use that emoji unironically should die
Jed,it's just hard to talk to stupid people so I'm sorry if I sounded toxic
Jed,"let's see:
you called him a rookie,
one of his shows a hentai,
laughed at his guilty pleasure,
told him most of what he'd seen was bad,
etc., I'm too lazy to pick through the rest of this"
Jed,also that is one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard
Jed,because you insulted him during the apology
Jed,I largely agree with your general opinion about stuff but you're arguing it so badly
Jed,I wasn't trying to be sincere lol
Jed,also I called it a hentai because i genuinely thought it was
Jed,whoops
Jed,but anyway I was saying all that stuff because he thought he was too good and I wanted to knock him down I guess
Jed,"anyhoo, this whole discussion is such a mess that I would genuinely prefer to go back to work than continue having it, so I'm out"
Jed,woah
Jed,sorry Sylki
Jed,well that conversation got out of hand real fast lol
Jed,Holy shit
Jed,I ask Zack if he has seen a show I'm watching
Jed,And the retard fort opens the floodgates of autism
Jed,"goddammit I'm on hold and they go ""press the pound sign to not have to listen to music"""
Jed,so I did
Jed,and instead they're now just advertising themselves
Jed,this is not what I wanted
Jed,Who you calling sylk boi
Jed,a hosting service cause the hosting's all fucked up
Jed,why are all the hardest parts of getting a website going things that have nothing to do with making the website
Jed,i know right its some stupid ass shit
Jed,@Zain has Daniel contacted you? I think I'm going to rape him on your behalf
Jed,no not yet

Jed,I mean I use the rocky theme song for that
Jed,okay
Jed,Keep listening to 500 miles
Jed,HOpe you can find a solution to whatever problems are plagueing your work
Jed,"it's like,
if this man can walk 500 miles to demonstrate his dedication to some chick, I can at least get this dumb thing done"

Jed,"I mean, you don't see any marios in top 10 these days"
Jed,he's 15th now
Jed,I was saying that we had figured out he was bad
Jed,"it's more just, how had top players not figured out how to beat roy"
Jed,This guy must have just been good
Jed,"Also, the cc meta pretty much didn't exist then"
Jed,fair
Jed,"still, step it up 2005 melee"
Jed,If any of us went back to 2004-5 melee we probably could have been top players. With how far the meta has come I imagine an average player today could be excellent

Jed,green beans were 16 seed
Jed,yeah but they got onion rings round 2
Jed,also stuffing got fucked
Jed,deserved way better than round 1 vs garlic bread
Jed,Garlic was seed 2 stuffing was seed 15
Jed,thats how it goes
Jed,ok but
Jed,what even is rice pilaf
Jed,^
Jed,tomato bisque???
Jed,it's a soup
Jed,thats just soup
Jed,a decent one
Jed,also stuffing is barely a side
Jed,but how common even is that
Jed,thats why its seeded low
Jed,"also I agree, stuffing is like,, a holiday only food"
Jed,Still a side though
Jed,yeah but barely tho hence the seed
Jed,that's like doing a pie tourney and sticking pumpkin pie super low
Jed,just cause it's mostly a thanksgiving thing

Jed,he had it and then he SD'd twice game three
Jed,That was so close
Jed,he'd better go ham in loser's

Jed,I've ended up half working and half watching other games cause melee's still pretty meh for the most part
Jed,I'm currently watching one of the most busted and poorly balanced fighting games of all time that's being run at a side event at evo
Jed,Which game is that?
Jed,it's this ancient snes sailor moon fighting game
Jed,"there's two torontonians in winner's finals, so I'm hyped for that, I guess"
Jed,also they both play hilariously busted characters so I can't wait to see that match
Jed,link?
Jed,"one character has absurd range on all her moves, a full screen dash, and a really strong command grab
the other one is crazy fast, and if they get under around 1/6 health they can stall infinitely and slowly chip you down until you have less health than them at timeout and they win"

Jed,"lololol toph's playing and his full tag shows up as ""THE READS Toph"""
Jed,yo who won the wobbles kjh set @Sak von Sak
Jed,kjh
Jed,wobbles wasn't wobbling
Jed,he did some cool handoffs though
Jed,he prolly wants to commentate
Jed,I figure he's mostly just there to have fun
Jed,and also commentate
Jed,but yeah
Jed,goddammit
Jed,the stream went down and this is the last thing we see
Jed,I saw a few more seconds and can confirm the uptilt missed

Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,Finna fight me at 9:15
Jed,good sheik players make sheik look like such a good character
Jed,whereas bad spacies make spacies look trash lol
Jed,I dont get why fox players ban to battlefield vs sheik
Jed,when most sheik players counterpick battlefield
Jed,just ban bfield and then FOD or yoshis based on preference
Jed,they could leverage the stage advantage so much more
Jed,"As a sheik player, which stage do you prefer against foxes"
Jed,i mean it doesnt really matter cause im not very good
Jed,colbol beat amsa
Jed,imo the fox-yoshi matchup is like 65-35
Jed,RISHI BEAT M2K
Jed,SMASH GOD
Jed,wouldnt it be sick if there was a top player who was a puff/marth dual main?
Jed,like what if hbox had m2k's marth
Jed,Then they would be unstoppable
Jed,@Mr. Airplane wanna watch Evo when I get home from work?
Jed,melee with the most viewers at evo rn

Jed,Why is this happening?
Jed,join the cord ill explain
Jed,@Zain Is darwin project good?
Jed,I like it
Jed,Is it a game that could be played together or is it only solo queue?
Jed,@Melee this training pack is actually really really cool
Jed,highly recommended
Jed,Lololol I didn't see sm4sh grands but what I'm hearing about it sounds hilarious
Jed,Bayo dittos
Jed,Whole crowd booing
Jed,Apparently at one point they both sat on opposite ends of the stage and charged neutral b for so long a TO had to come out and give them shit about it
Jed,Game's dead I think
Jed,Or maybe this is what happens when #1 and #2 can't make evo
Jed,Nobody fucking cares about that game anymore
Jed,Melee is still hype
Jed,Bayo and Cloud were the worst things to ever happen to smash 4
Jed,It was pretty balanced before then
Jed,The list of viable characters was pretty long
Jed,But still fundamentally boring to play and watch
Jed,They are playing the DK rap on the evo stream lol
Jed,"also, at least cloud is actually fairly fun to watch, compared to a lot of the cast"
Jed,bayo not so much
Jed,Guy with a smash ultimate shirt standing behind the players
Jed,Announcement incoming?
Jed,I think the leaks said something was supposed to get announced at evo
Jed,They did
Jed,"and even without that, evo's a pretty good time to announce anything about a fighting game"
Jed,I think a few other games have had little announcements already
Jed,hey I overslept is this the first match @Max
Jed,There have not been any games yet
Jed,fantastic
Jed,did i miss anything on the stream
Jed,no
Jed,fantastic
Jed,YO HBOX
Jed,he just took 3 stocks in like 40 seconds
Jed,why did he ban fd and not stadium?
Jed,I think FD is worse
Jed,Right call imo
Jed,hot take leffen wins evo
Jed,Lets go
Jed,wow
Jed,"3 stock in hbox's favour, last hit, 3 stock in leffen's favour"
Jed,wack set
Jed,just to note my message was before stock 1 of the 3rd game
Jed,Amazing not to tilt after game 1
Jed,although real talk hbox was flubbing left and right
Jed,I say he's either gonna crumble or go on a nutty loser's run
Jed,time to cheer for wizzy over swedish
Jed,no
Jed,swedish
Jed,lets go
Jed,@Zain Mango about to play
Jed,alrightr
Jed,"I like swedish, but wizzy has a much much better record over hbox"
Jed,yeah of da sheiks
Jed,https://www.twitch.tv/evo
Jed,evo - Twitch
Jed,EVO 2018 - CHAMPIONSHIP SUNDAY
Jed,also swedish has looked good against hbox in da past
Jed,and plup beat him with sheik at CEO
Jed,We could have armada Hbox for 4th
Jed,plup is so good
Jed,and mango so bad
Jed,rip mango
Jed,that
Jed,was so sad
Jed,that was a very mango set
Jed,That was pretty good
Jed,"he played amazing for a chunk of it, mediocre for a chunk, and SD'd a bunch"
Jed,the first game was sick by plup tho
Jed,yaw first game plup was playing out of his mind
Jed,New gods winners finals
Jed,lets go
Jed,big house part 2
Jed,This is winnable
Jed,S2J has almost beat him before
Jed,"and when he did, he won the first two games"
Jed,which would be the set in this case
Jed,that'd be crazy though
Jed,I'd put like 80/20 odds on armada winning
Jed,shoutouts2jesus
Jed,
Jed,?
Jed,That's s2j
Jed,oh
Jed,someone said in chat
Jed,armada has gotten 3 stitches since being put in losers
Jed,the script boys
Jed,damnn
Jed,those stocks were spicy
Jed,SHOUTOUTS TO JESUS
Jed,hes losing on fod tho
Jed,He might opt for fd instead
Jed,huh
Jed,bfield?
Jed,S2J can do this
Jed,I wanna see armada mango
Jed,not s2j mango
Jed,chokes
Jed,rip
Jed,so many special turnips
Jed,chooooookes
Jed,s2j choked that so hard
Jed,S2j is out?
Jed,"Hey guys, I'm here from Guilty Gear, just wanted to say that I can see why you were being a bunch of immature children in chat - seeing as you literally play a kids game. Honestly, it's just sad seeing you losers spam emotes every time Mario does his jump attack or whatever. Grow up!."
Jed,What is this copy pasta
Jed,From the chat
Jed,ik
Jed,@Trapezoider S2J is out but wizzy is still in
Jed,
Jed,Waiting for this special ed kid's game to be over so I can watch some fucking tekken.
Jed,same
Jed,I HAVE A 3 WORD ESSAY DUE TOMORROW AND I'M WATCHING MELEE NotLikeThis
Jed,Why is this Swedish dude wearing sunglasses
Jed,he has eye issues
Jed,its not just for style
Jed,is winners finals b05 or just losers and grands?
Jed,I think winners finals is bo5
Jed,Leffen said so on his twitter at least
Jed,Did you guys just see the camera?
Jed,well he could just be saying that because hes gonna be in either grands or losers finals
Jed,rip
Jed,wow mango
Jed,that was... pretty bad
Jed,how does he almost always play terrible at evo
Jed,we need a better bird player
Jed,He puts a lot of pressure on himself probably
Jed,the bird must fly again
Jed,"From chat ""we live in a world where s2j took a game off armada and mango didnt... hmmmm"""
Jed,lol
Jed,"real talk tho, mango was playing really sloppy"
Jed,like s2j game 3 slop
Jed,ouch wizzy
Jed,wizzy finna save melee?
Jed,The only falcon to ever play the character correctly
Jed,yeah n0ne of course
Jed,also 1/4 of both the top 12 and top 8 were falcon players thats pretty wack
Jed,its over
Jed,bruh
Jed,damn
Jed,damn
Jed,that was super close though
Jed,hbox's pressure was so good once he had the lead though
Jed,wizzy needed space and hbox wasn't giving him any
Jed,leffen unstopable
Jed,I'll stop him
Jed,go chris
Jed,fox ditto time?
Jed,lol
Jed,rip
Jed,Leffen is so good
Jed,My inspiration
Jed,he's crazy
Jed,plup is kinda like new mew2king
Jed,he gets deflated p easy
Jed,i dont see him winning in losers
Jed,ouch
Jed,yo boys we finna play some melee after evo
Jed,this is so tense
Jed,this aint even grands
Jed,ouch
Jed,Almost a time out
Jed,clutchbox please
Jed,@Max
Jed,is wizzy still here?
Jed,no
Jed,NO
Jed,well i have no reason to watch this tream then 
Jed,rip
Jed,Melee is saved
Jed,Thank god armada won
Jed,evo is hype
Jed,hes so chubby
Jed,watch anyway
Jed,yeeees armada
Jed,Hbox doesn't even have shoes on
Jed,guys can we joinup like????
Jed,This is hype city
Jed,leffen plup armada top 3 this is pretty much as well as I could have hoped for
Jed,
Jed,its not even grand finals
Jed,plup leffen grand finals
Jed,Lets go
Jed,that's what I'm hoping for
Jed,"I want fifteen games from hereon out, and I honestly don't really care that much how they go if we get that"
Jed,My boy big leff better win this
Jed,@Melee can we all joinup for grandfinals ples
Jed,not gonna lie armada winning would be sick
Jed,no
Jed,gay^
Jed,even though i dont likeem
Jed,I kinda want the armada insane loser's run
Jed,I want to listen to the casters
Jed,armada winning would mean beating 6 of the other top 9 members
Jed,and every other top 6 player
Jed,FROM LOSERS
Jed,who did wizrobe play before hbox knocked him out
Jed,i cant see on the bracket
Jed,to get the 3vo
Jed,swedish
Jed,which other evos did armada win
Jed,2015 2017
Jed,2017 and 2015
Jed,"over hbox in 2015, mango in 2017"
Jed,yeah
Jed,mango won 2013 and 14
Jed,hbox 2016

Jed,Who is up now
Jed,armada plup loser's finals
Jed,press 1 to vote for armada
Jed,1
Jed,is this live?
Jed,yes
Jed,:0
Jed,LETS GO PLUP
Jed,wait
Jed,was the rest of the bracket 2/3?
Jed,yes
Jed,wow
Jed,it's cause it's evo
Jed,they need it to run quickly enough
Jed,also the evo top brass don't much care for melee
Jed,hence our shitty time slot
Jed,why
Jed,we bring so much to the event
Jed,Thats so dumb
Jed,cause they're old school fgc people
Jed,Dont we literally get the most viewers?
Jed,"the main head guy apparently loooooves tekken even though it doesn't get as good viewership as melee, sf, dbfz and he gave tekken a ton of preferential treatment"
Jed,thats so dumb
Jed,i didnt know the evo staff was gay
Jed,randall!!
Jed,melee in particular has a history of getting shafted in various ways at evo
Jed,this year's the worst though probably
Jed,I missed most of top 8 because of this time slot
Jed,Armada hype
Jed,Didn't we get Saturday last year
Jed,oh yeah
Jed,but at least we didn't have super early morning pools
Jed,"""Whenever I see top players do what I do. Alarm bells"""
Jed,Scar is awesome
Jed,he's a good commentator for higher level discussion of stuff
Jed,"where he's not as deep in the nitty gritty details, but he understands players and mentalities really well"
Jed,Have toph and scar done every evo?
Jed,fox is stupid
Jed,no u
Jed,YES
Jed,up air is such a dumb move
Jed,"I don't think they did the super old school evos, but I'm pretty sure they've done top 8 or at least top 4 from 2013-2018"
Jed,jbaited
Jed,"honestly, it wouldn't feel like evo at this point without scar and toph"
Jed,they are such a good combo
Jed,armada 4 stock
Jed,also real talk
Jed,how many times has plup gotten 3rd at evo
Jed,+1 more times
Jed,I feel bad
Jed,yeah plup's not looking like his normal self
Jed,the boost grab he missed was so sad
Jed,
Jed,Time for leffen to take it
Jed,ever since he beat mango he's been not looking that good
Jed,"but yeah, I think this is... 3 or 4 now"
Jed,rip
Jed,poggers?
Jed,Nintendo direct in 3 days
Jed,
Jed,pfft nintendo cop out on making an actual announcement
Jed,poggers
Jed,they announced an announcement
Jed,what a bunch of fucking champs
Jed,I dont like the evo stage this year
Jed,it was way cooler last year
Jed,
Jed,WAIT ITS THE SAME?????? It looks so different from some of these angles
Jed,"I honestly don't really care who wins this, so long as this is as good as their sets normally are"
Jed,
Jed,that nose shine
Jed,Leffen looking fresh
Jed,holy shit
Jed,what a fucking god
Jed,"""proto tractor pro tractor"
Jed,what a fucking new god
Jed,what was that???
Jed,one more
Jed,OH
Jed,oh shit
Jed,not like this
Jed,
Jed,oh my goodness

Jed,About to fight one prolly
Jed,I have almost no knowledge on that matchup. I will say though that you are good at tech chasing and should probably go for that. Just don't forget to actually lead it into moves eventually in order to really build up damage.

Jed,When's the last time you guys played a set?
Jed,prolly same time I played Ava
Jed,wait no it was
Jed,and I beat him
Jed,Then you are better than Ava
Jed,She would not be able to beat him
Jed,I've beat trap tho
Jed,wym
Jed,In a set vs his main?

Jed,rip my guy
Jed,I am six feet tall
Jed,im 6'9

Jed,so I'm gonna have to now wait until the next time my brother visits to have a properly fitting semi-ironic in&out tshirt
Jed,just tie it in the back my guy
Jed,you don't understand how long this shirt is
Jed,if I were a girl i could plausibly wear it as a dress

Jed,Andrew is a decent player
Jed,"so it's me and andrew, you and any terran, who's protossing?"
Jed,Don't you play Protoss?
Jed,more zerg lately
Jed,I was assuming you would be the protoss
Jed,I could
Jed,We could shuffle Andrew on to terran you to zerg and me to protoss
Jed,I prefer zerg lately but I could help with whoever's the new protoss
Jed,Kameron is the terran Zain is the zerg and Chris is the protoss
Jed,zack go back to work
Jed,"I mean we can start with me and chris, you and kameron, and andrew zain and then rotate as needed"
Jed,Sounds good
Jed,No
Jed,Why?
Jed,I don't play Terran
Jed,I only know zerg macro
Jed,The line up he listed would make you zerg
Jed,I will get bodied
Jed,When is this happening
Jed,Tonight if everyone is available I think
Jed,I mean I think no matter what the team with me as the 'experienced' player is gonna get fucked
Jed,since it is a 1v1v1 you can always shift alliances depending on who is winning
Jed,lol true

Jed,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

Jed,The more you ask the furthur away it becomes
Jed,"Boys, I found a new game for us to play"
Jed,"I'll tell you guys about it later, but it's really fun"
Jed,@Homies
Jed,whats it called?
Jed,"""I'll tell you guys about it later"""
Jed,ffs tell us the name now
Jed,so we can look into it
Jed,and play it later
Jed,No
Jed,Tell us what it is
Jed,"Ok, you twisted my arm as far as it will go"
Jed,It's not on steam by the way
Jed,It's called
Jed,Primeops
Jed,It's free at
Jed,ProductofPrimes.itch.io/Primeops
Jed,The devs are a friend of my buddy
Jed,It's real fun
Jed,Also you're gonna need a controller to play
Jed,Will Xbox work?
Jed,I'll get it tonight
Jed,I'll be home at 7:30-8 pst
Jed,Yo boys my 28 yr/old retarded sister is finally moving out
Jed,HYPE
Jed,Xbox works
Jed,"pools commentary is, although kind of crap, perfectly fitting for pools"
Jed,they're not even talking about the set except for every now and then
Jed,they're just going off on ridiculous tangents about photosynthesis
Jed,"but like, it's sfat bodying some rando"
Jed,actual commentary would be kinda weird
Jed,holy shit mango almost lost that set
Jed,Who was he against?
Jed,some random puff
Jed,he's not even top 100
Jed,Was he playing Falco?
Jed,yeah
Jed,"lololol he just walked over to the commentary and goes ""no one ever talks about my good double lasers. Those were some good double lasers that set"""
Jed,nothing about the fact that he just went last hit with some non-top 100 player
Jed,"Ok @Homies I gotta break the news to you now, I don't think the game has online multiplayer"
Jed,bummer dude
Jed,I'm becoming more and more sure that hbox takes damage on purpose once he is at 50 until he is at around 90.
Jed,Why?
Jed,So that all the easy kill setups don't work
Jed,"at around 90 you can't really upthrow upair, weak nair upsmash, I dunno if jab upsmash works (I think jab upair still works but it's hard)"
Jed,Are you guys seeing this
Jed,basically your only safe-ish kill option becomes bair at like 140
Jed,Those drawings lol
Jed,"also, n0ne 3-1'd wizzy let's go"
Jed,he's gonna get bodied by zain probably though
Jed,When I play vs puff I actually don't laser past up throw up air %
Jed,also pewpewu vs s2j should be good
Jed,oh damn moky brought shroomed to game 5
Jed,lol n0ne
Jed,he was going so ham
Jed,and then he just
Jed,jumps in the middle of a marth combo
Jed,and that's that
Jed,Did mango drop out of shine?
Jed,naw
Jed,there's two brackets to top 8
Jed,this is only one half
Jed,there's still another 32 person bracket going on after this
Jed,These stats are so pointless
Jed,They should have the openings per kill stat
Jed,That is by far the best one
Jed,or edgeguard %
Jed,Yo
Jed,What tourney is going on?
Jed,shine 2018
Jed,S2J vs Wizzy about to start
Jed,I'm sure you want to see that one
Jed,I'll watch the good

Jed,we tryna play some games kids?
Jed,man plup had such a nice run to top 8
Jed,fairly weak puff -> samus ditto -> ics
Jed,"man why are they like ""in case you sheiks are struggling with this matchup, these tips might help!"""
Jed,they don't need the help
Jed,we samuses need the help
Jed,It is probably because neither of them know what help to give Samus. Sheik knowledge is much more widely known.
Jed,fair enough
Jed,"also, apparently void (the sm4sh guy) is pretty good at dbzf"
Jed,"he made top 8 at shine, which, while not super stacked, still has a few names I recognize"
Jed,admittadly they're both names I know from different games (one from skullgirls and one from p4au) but presumably they're still pretty good
Jed,What is p4au?
Jed,persona 4 arena
Jed,I'm not sure why they add the u
Jed,possibly the full title of one of the updates? persona 4 arena ultimax?
Jed,and also possibly cause p4a might be the acronym for persona 4 the animation
Jed,duuuuck that was a free fsmash
Jed,why did you try for bair
Jed,that only would have killed on sweet spot
Jed,I honestly think he might have taken that game if he'd just done fsmash
Jed,cause he would have been winning

things that I can pick out that tie these together: female singer, on the slower/sadder end of things, variable intensity between the verse and the chorus (like, the verses are a little tamer and then the chorus hits more of an emotional intensity)"

Jed,"so for some reason, in toronto all the weeklies I used to go to are on hiatus"
Jed,but I found that there's a weekly like fifteen minutes walk from my house
Jed,the only problem: it usually only gets been 3 and 6 entrants
Jed,"is it worth my time? it won't be a great tourney probably, and their schedule is wack as hell, probably to accomadate for the fact that they're running melee, sm4sh, and pm separately cause the venue is tiny"
Jed,"on the flip side, I've got a good chance of placing in the money"
Jed,I think you should go
Jed,I probably will
Jed,just to get a little melee in
Jed,and maybe I'll also try to farm the sm4sh tournament

print('\nInterest = %0.2f' %interest)



For some reason when I am testing this and entering the roi, it spits out this"
Jed,"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""F:\PROGRAMS\calculator.py"", line 4, in <module>
    years = input(int('Duration (no. of years) ?'))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Duration (no. of years) ?'"
Jed,should be int(input('duration'))
Jed,so I dont wanna use a float value for roi
Jed,OH
Jed,this is for years
Jed,did you read the error message?
Jed,it tells you which line is going wrong
Jed,and a description of why
Jed,IVE Never debugged
Jed,i didnt get what the mans was trying to tell me
Jed,im using Thonny as my editor
Jed,"in this case, that there was something going wrong with the int() funciton, specifically that the arguments you gave it were invalid"
Jed,"at the very least, that should tell you where and what is going wrong"
Jed,"it has the problem after the roi bit because once you input the roi, it tries to run the next line of code, which has the error"
Jed,i fixed it
Jed,now i got another bug
Jed,ayo
Jed,i made a calculator. @Sak von Sak whats another easy beginning project I can work on
Jed,one I had fun with was making a text adventure game
Jed,oh wow
Jed,that sounds difficult
Jed,ill give it a go
Jed,do you know how to do loops yet?
Jed,cause you're gonna need em
Jed,no sir
Jed,i know how to print
Jed,how to make variables
Jed,ok step one learn how to do for and while loops
Jed,that with what you already know should be enough
Jed,thank you sack
Jed,@Homies what's the biggest mistake New comers make when learning a programming language? What's the most common trap to fall into that will set you back instead of progressing your learning
Jed,this question makes no sense
Jed,yea
Jed,i mean i guess
Jed,i think people shouldnt focus
Jed,on syntax and the language in it self
Jed,more on what they wanna make in it
Jed,incorrect syntax
Jed,but i dont
Jed,think
Jed,theres
Jed,much that could set you back
Jed,when learning a language
Jed,Why would you need to need to make that 5 messages
Jed,"programming isn't like english where you can do something wrong without noticing, if something is wrong in programming it wont work period"
Jed,so if things are working you're gucci
Jed,and if they aren't figure out why
Jed,ayyy anyone wanna play some ow or melee later? @Homies

Jed,"A little tip that might help you @Trapezoider is to plan, either in your head or on a piece of paper, what the main function of your program is probably gonna look like"
Jed,ye
Jed,think about the process before the code
Jed,Just jumping straight into it can get confusing
Jed,and make you lose track
Jed,Planning I feel can also help with the efficiency of your program

Jed,I sure wouldn't write an essay like that
Jed,I mean
Jed,its an opinion so as long as its written well it'd work
Jed,This is the kind of thing where I would have to get to know the prof before making the call on whether it would be okay to write such a paper.

Jed,bded403e
Jed,@Zain Don't leave without talking with me real quick please
Jed,ok
Jed,"aight so if I get a switch it's ~$380, but if I get a switch and either BoTW or Odessey it's ~$420 (so basically $40 for a game I was planning on getting anyway)

which should I go for?"
Jed,Personally I think I would go for Odyssey
Jed,If you like more of a 3d platform-ish style with a more linear story
Jed,It's movement is fantastic and really satisfying to pull off
Jed,There is a lot of content in the game if you like going and collecting the moons
Jed,The puzzles in the game are fun and interesting
Jed,The capture mechanic is also really fun
Jed,..........
Jed,BotW on the other hand
Jed,Is more if you like an open world adventure type game with a non-linear story that you get to explore at your own discretion
Jed,I find the fighting very rewarding in this game but sometimes I feel that the weapons break too quickly for my liking
Jed,hm
Jed,"If you're looking for a traditional Zelda game with lots of dungeons and boss fights, there are only a handful of them in the game"
Jed,But I liked the shrines enough to fulfil the dungeon portion
Jed,I just wish there were more bosses
Jed,"The exploring and doing whatever you want though is the main draw for the game, collecting things to make food and potions, doing side quests, taking out hordes of enemies, completing shrines to upgrade yourself"
Jed,"I'm thinking I'll probably go with odessey, cause the other game I'm gonna get is xenoblade, which  will probably be good for my fix of more open world-ish stuff"
Jed,all the exploration stuff and the story stuff 'n stuff
Jed,Glad that I could help
Jed,
Jed,I'm planning on spending my entire first week's paycheck (after taxes) on games and stuff
Jed,"including a proper hard drive so I'll finally not be able to make the ""it won't fit on my teeny tiny hard drive"" excuse"
Jed,Zack make sure you get botw at some point
Jed,Definitely one of those games you really gotta play at some point

Jed,"for me personally, i feel like oddessy loses it's charm and collecting moons becomes boring after a while. while everytime i come back to zelda i learn something new or find more shit."
Jed,i have alot more hours into zelda and still feel like i haven't found everything
Jed,while oddessy feels like a grind
Jed,"350 ish hours into zelda
120 ish into oddessy"
Jed,"xenoblade is pretty linear btw. and bombards you with sidequests up the butt that you can't beat till later, or you do so many sidequests that you are overleveled"
Jed,also get the dlc for xenoblade its amazing
Jed,I will once I'm done the main game
Jed,I'm with rainbow on the Mario thing
Jed,I didn't even beat the game because I lost interest and found it boring
Jed,You guys are a couple of hosers
Jed,ill vacuum your fucking pork sword dweeb
Jed,Finish Odyssey then come talk to me
Jed,
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,melee?
Jed,"alright, I've now got a 2TB hard drive, a switch, two games for it, and pokemon sun arriving within the next week"
Jed,I am significantly less rich than I was ten minutes ago
Jed,feelsgoodman
Jed,wait did you choose oddessy or zelda
Jed,very important question
Jed,ZELDA IS BETTER AND HAS WAY MORE HOURS IN IT
Jed,im pretty sure you didnt read the entire thing correctly
Jed,you missed ODDESSY LOSES ITS CHARM
Jed,also zelda has more content than oddessy
Jed,especially if you include the dlc
Jed,you're all too late I got odessey already
Jed,i can lend you zelda
Jed,I'm gonna get both at some point and early on I'd rather have more gameplay variety
Jed,oh we should exchange switch codes
Jed,it won't arrive till tuesday
Jed,rip
Jed,I don't think Odyssey loses its charm at all
Jed,i meant more like. it doesnt captivate you to continue playing after you beat it
Jed,"i beat the main story, got like 50 more moons then got bored of the game"
Jed,because its the same shit
Jed,It did for me
Jed,I got all of them
Jed,Except like 2 because idk where they are
Jed,;-;
Jed,I got around 400 moons? i dont remember...
Jed,most of the moons are placed so easily
Jed,and served no challenge to me
Jed,the more challenging moons are placed so bs with no room for creativity
Jed,especially the darker side
Jed,I'm not saying oddessy is a bad game. im just saying that botw offers more. and would be the game i would recommend first.

Jed,??
Jed,personality type
Jed,thats what I am
Jed,ENTJ here
Jed,I feel like im a mix between entj and entj
Jed,Is this personality test even good? @SWIRL GIRL
Jed,there's no real evidence supporting its validity
Jed,I just think its fun to think about
Jed,the big five is another personality test that has a lot more research behind it if anyone wants another test to take
Jed,That's the good one
Jed,My distributions are as follows
Jed,"Openness: 93rd %
Conscientiousness: 67th %
Extraversion: 98th %
Agreeablesness: 0th%
Neuroticism: 3rd %"
Jed,@Trapezoider What trait would make someone have a high level of skepticism?
Jed,Low openness
Jed,And possibly high neuroticism
Jed,Both of which run in your family
Jed,Which family member are you referring to?
Jed,Both your mother and your father
Jed,You also got high conscientiousness from your dad
Jed,Personality tests are really stupid
Jed,You are really stupid

Jed,down to clown for a bit
Jed,is short hop needle cancel fair a thing? @Melee
Jed,cause I feels like that'd be pretty effective
Jed,I don't think a short hop provides enough airtime to both needle and do a fair.
Jed,it does I tested it
Jed,as long as you dont fast fall
Jed,you can do it
Jed,I would guess people avoid it because you can stil cc the fair while needle grab cannot be cc'd and it provides a greater potential punish.
Jed,no needle cancel fair
Jed,like threaten needles into fair
Jed,I've never really seen that
Jed,you cant needle into fair
Jed,or maybe like needle cancel tomahawk
Jed,@Max did you do thanksgiving dinner already
Jed,yes
Jed,same
Jed,My family prefers to do it more for lunch then for dinner
Jed,yuck
Jed,after reading reddit for awhile a lot of casual/smash 4 players seem to think melee sucks because a lot of characters are unviable and the roster is small
Jed,but like there are more varied character archetypes than any of the other games
Jed,and arguable still more viable characters than sm4sh lol
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL @Zain alright I just won 3 soloq games in a row on lucio so lets trio what could go wrong

Jed,Ok @Homies
Jed,I found out who the guy banging on my door was
Jed,Who?
Jed,So
Jed,little background
Jed,Did you kick his ass?
Jed,Mike yesterday ordered a new microphone on Amazon
Jed,And it was supposed to come in today
Jed,Like before 9:00pm
Jed,So another little background
Jed,We never get stuff delivered to our door
Jed,because we are in a building and you need a key to access it
Jed,and our mailbox is too small
Jed,"so they leave it at the front desk of the main building, and they will send an email saying that they have your package"
Jed,"So he gets the email from the delivery man saying that the thing is delivered, and he's now waiting for the email from the front desk"
Jed,It's been like 30 minutes at this point
Jed,so he decides to check the original email
Jed,and in it there's a picture of the door to our room
Jed,with the package on the floor
Jed,So
Jed,This guy somehow got inside of our building
Jed,Went to our door
Jed,knocked
Jed,and fucking BOOKED IT
Jed,"Like I heard the knock, got up and peered through the peephole"
Jed,"and there was nothing, or nobody in the hallway"
Jed,"Again a knock, the same thing happens"
Jed,"nothing, and noone"
Jed,So it seems like this company hired literally the Flash to deliver packages
Jed,because I immediately got up to check the door and nobody was in sight
Jed,Elusive as fuck
Jed,Maybe he just ducked down
Jed,But why would he do that
Jed,It's literally his job to deliver the package
Jed,Then again
Jed,Why would he run away at mach 10

Jed,@Max
Jed,I think my endeavor for internet has finally ended
Jed,You got it working?
Jed,I have found a solution yes
Jed,Awesome
Jed,The correct solution is usually the simplest one
Jed,"I tried a few different ways of turning my phone into a hotspot without data, tethering, Bluetooth"
Jed,Tried some weird app that was supposed to work
Jed,Just wouldn't connect
Jed,So I just tried looking up how to connect my switch to the WiFi at my school
Jed,All I have to do is email some tech support desk to put my switch on a whitelist so that it can connect
Jed,Praise Reddit
Jed,so you can play smash?
Jed,"Hell yeah I can. I just need to send the email, I'm gonna do it later today"
Jed,also 4 days 
Jed,longest 4 days of my life
Jed,Yeah no kidding. I wish it wasn't exam time right now though
Jed,grumbles 22 days for me
Jed,Wait why?
Jed,@Max you at school?
Jed,I just got back
Jed,Why?
Jed,@Mr. Airplane
Jed,melee?
Jed,sure
Jed,one sec
Jed,Not going to be able to talk or play high apm characters
Jed,Ava is still doing school
Jed,90f124d8
Jed,@The Rona not allowed to buy things during December to avoid overlaps with Christmas so I've gotta wait till the 25th to either receive or buy it
Jed,Feels bad man
Jed,Yup
Jed,It'd be less annoying if I was in exams and it'd be a good excuse to nor waste studying time
Jed,But I'm working so it just kinda sucks
Jed,Should have pre-purchased  the game before December 
Jed,@Sak von Sak whatchu mean not allowed
Jed,ur an adult
Jed,with a job
Jed,I mean I could but I don't out of fear of familial ostracization
Jed,?
Jed,why
Jed,I guess me and Chris will just have an 18 day head start on you then.
Jed,Hell yeah
Jed,My Incineroar is gonna be popping off
Jed,My name is weird now
Jed,How did you do that?
Jed,Some random guy in the UWaterloo discrod had it
Jed,So I stole it
Jed,is that supposed to be a really big uwu?
Jed,I think so
Jed,lol
Jed,I'm just gonna leech off people every weekend
Jed,Come leech off of me
Jed,Actually don't
Jed,At least not until the 18th
Jed,You're kinda far
Jed,Also I generally have an advantage from having played more sm4sh
Jed,I hope to be able to catch up within a month but that might be too ambitious
Jed,Assuming the game is fun
Jed,I might just not like it
Jed,Well see
Jed,Aren't you in Toronto Zack?
Jed,Oh are you back atm? As opposed to waterloo?
Jed,After the 18th I am
Jed,Sweet
Jed,Although I have non-weekend time off until the 24th
Jed,@Sak von Sak Which characters are you interested in for Ultimate?
Jed,"Pichu, wolf, zelda, inceneroar are my main ones"
Jed,Why not pikachu?
Jed,Cause apparently pichu isn't awful
Jed,but pikachu is probably #1 in the game
Jed,The new Zelda looks kinda okay for once
Jed,"A) don't have much faith in pre release tier lists
B) when have I ever cared about how good a character is over how much fun I have with them"
Jed,She will probably be top tier
Jed,Also yeah I'm hyped for good zelda
Jed,I played some brawl recently and I still love brawl zelda
Jed,"I'm interested in Snake, Simon, Ike, Bayonetta, and Meta Knight."
Jed,So I'm excited for her not sucking
Jed,8c38e79c
Jed,wait
Jed,sm5sh is out?
Jed,Friday
Jed,Get 5mash @Trapezoider
Jed,they're calling it 5mash??? lol
Jed,how is that even pronounced
Jed,I have no idea
Jed,I just did it because Andrew wrote it the other way
Jed,oh
Jed,Near the games announcement people were calling it smush
Jed,I prefer 5ma5h
Jed,"Or, if you're picky, 5mu5h"
Jed,I like Ultimate
Jed,"Pronounced ""five-muh-five-hrrrr"""
Jed,Like the Hebrew throat h sound
Jed,My switch now has internet!

Jed,Thanks buddy
Jed,yo kids
Jed,crisis averted
Jed,purchasing 5ma5h
Jed,:pog:
Jed,What changed your mind?
Jed,well the main thing preventing me was a family rule about not buying stuff for yourself during december to avoid undercutting other people's christmas gifts
Jed,but I just kinda asked if I could anyway
Jed,you could also just
Jed,do it without asking
Jed,^
Jed,"Wow you really didn't want to see me that much, huh?"
Jed,You should get better internet for christmas
Jed,"well if I didn't ask, I run the risk of having the game, getting it as a gift, and that being both a) real awkward and b) a wasted gift"
Jed,also I literally have zero control over the terrible internet
Jed,it has to do with the line into our house
Jed,It used to not be this bad
Jed,hey guys guess what
Jed,What?
Jed,What?
Jed,UwU whats this
Jed,"Hey guys, let's kill @Mr. Airplane"
Jed,"@Mr. Airplane 
Spider GF: Catches you in her web
Spider GF: 88w88 whats this"
Jed,this man
Jed,its me
Jed,@Max how do you asdi?
Jed,I hate you
Jed,DOn't answer him
Jed,hold the cstick when in hitlag
Jed,...
Jed,You dissapoint me
Jed,?
Jed,how
Jed,do I not press it before hand
Jed,holding the cstick does not require pressing a button
Jed,no
Jed,do I hold it before the hit starts?
Jed,you can
Jed,why isnt it working then?
Jed,but if you are not in hitstun you will do a move
Jed,asdi is only 1 sdi input and usually isn't enough to make a differnece
Jed,i mean asdi down
Jed,why would you want to do that
Jed,
Jed,im holding the cstick
Jed,but i still go up
Jed,What is the situation here?
Jed,Are you edgeguarding?
Jed,this is an uncle punch challenge
Jed,what % are you at?
Jed,at really low % sometimes asdi down tech doesn't work
Jed,well it SHOULD work cause its literally built into the game
Jed,I don't really know what this even is
Jed,
Jed,(that means that it isn't important)
Jed,That isn't what I mean
Jed,I don't know the situation where you are trying to use this
Jed,i just feel like the asdi down isnt working
Jed,is ALL i need to do hold the cstick down?
Jed,I think so
Jed,You could try both sticks though
Jed,did
Jed,What % are you at
Jed,maybe asdi just like doesnt work on my controller
Jed,that is important
Jed,max
Jed,its a simulation
Jed,it should work
Jed,MODS... can... be... broken...
Jed,try taunting
Jed,this one is pretty trustworthy tho
Jed,I'm not joking
Jed,
Jed,Maybe you are not timing everything correctly
Jed,I really don't know
Jed,you should really download this modpack
Jed,i wanna see how many sdi inputs you can get on the upthrow upair sim
Jed,i usually get 1 or 2
Jed,which upon doing  r e s e a r c h
Jed,should be enough to get out of upthrow upair p consistently
Jed,but I know your good at it
Jed,Maybe I'll get it when I go on break
Jed,it seems like its prolly humanly impossible to get more than 3 inputs so I guess im doing it right
Jed,melee is sick
Jed,It is definitely possible to get at least 4
Jed,either way im pretty sure 2 is really good
Jed,https://twitter.com/unclepunch_/status/992525190063099905?lang=en

Jed,Yes
Jed,:(
Jed,He won't charge from a cable either
Jed,I haven't used it in months I think it's deadzo
Jed,That's a feels bad man
Jed,Keep trying though
Jed,Batteries and cables are weird
Jed,Try a different cable
Jed,dayum advanced settings are nice in ultimate
Jed,"stage hazards on/off, rage on off, a hilarious option for the stage to randomly change every minute"
Jed,F
Jed,Im just tryna ultimate
Jed,Just leave your Switch plugged in @Trapezoider
Jed,It just might look like it isn't charging when it really is
Jed,It just doesn't have enough battery to show that it is
Jed,Okay I will try that
Jed,How long does the download take?

Jed,No idea how long the download takes
Jed,I got the physical copy

Jed,My game has an hour left
Jed,So im gonna play a cs go or two
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,I gotta leave at 5 PST for gym and christmas stuff
Jed,You gonna be on before then?
Jed,Yeah I'll take a brake before then
Jed,Are you going to be back after though?
Jed,Yes
Jed,Like 9-10pm pst
Jed,
Jed,rip
Jed,90%
Jed,
Jed,Its happening boys
Jed,This intro song is weird
Jed,Are you kidding
Jed,That song is some fire
Jed,This bitches voice is annoying tho
Jed,D:
Jed,YO THERES VOICE ACTING IN CAMPAIGN
Jed,HYPE
Jed,Imagine doing the campaign to unlock characters
Jed,Isnt that what I have to do
Jed,nope
Jed,^
Jed,how do I get all the dudes?
Jed,"Play a game and do nothing but run and jump for 20 minutes then play games with 1 life and sd at the beginning. After every game, change the language."
Jed,this gets all characters in 2-2.5 hours
Jed,the fastest known method
Jed,Im just gonna play campaign on easy. That sounds really unfun
Jed,you will take way longer to unlock characters
Jed,See you next week when you unlock everyone
Jed,I dont need everyone
Jed,Just falcon
Jed,I think you will actually need to play story mode more than once
Jed,I think you get Falcon pretty early
Jed,Easy
Jed,I don't recommend playing the same character in multiple games
Jed,As in
Jed,Not in the story mode
Jed,Doing the method that Max described
Jed,There is a set order that you unlock the characters in doing that
Jed,Falcon plays completely different then he does in melee
Jed,This Ost is some fire
Jed,Okay I might do the thing
Jed,Story mode sux because theres ITEMS
Jed,LOL
Jed,If you insist on falcon I remember he is unlocked early
Jed,You still get to fight the characters by doing the other method
Jed,So it's not like you're just sitting there unlocking mans
Jed,You gotta beat them first
Jed,whats the first thing I gotta do
Jed,Run/ jump around for 20 minutes in a match
Jed,don't fight just move
Jed,plug in 2 controllers so the cpu doesn't attack you
Jed,set the rules to time 20 minutes
Jed,I dont have a second controller rn. Can I just not attack and try to live for 20 mins?
Jed,If I take dmg is it over?
Jed,You realise that a joy con is a controller
Jed,you can take damage
Jed,it is just annoying
Jed,Are you using a gamecube controller Andrew?
Jed,yes
Jed,Then use your joycons as a second controller
Jed,ez clapper
Jed,Already started the time
Jed,Not worth easy
Jed,wavelanding kinda sucks

Jed,I accidentally used the thing from kirby
Jed,I didnt damage the cpu
Jed,do i need to start over?

Jed,What do you mean you used the thing from kirby?
Jed,the three piece ship
Jed,I accidentally picked up all 3 and activated it
Jed,no dmg though
Jed,there is no need to start over
Jed,All you are doing is increasing an invisible steps taken and times jumped counter
Jed,As long as you continue to do those things everything is fine
Jed,"so just keep jumping
?"
Jed,literally it's totally fine
Jed,What do I do after game one
Jed,just move around and jump
Jed,just run and jump for 20 minutes
Jed,after the time runs out you will get to unlock ness
Jed,"then play 1-stock games and as soon as you get a character, fight em then change the game language and then play more 1-stock games until you get everyone"
Jed,then change the language and change the rules to 1 stock
Jed,in system settings or game settings?
Jed,game settings
Jed,do I kill the ai during sudden death or let myself die?
Jed,@Ultimate
Jed,Doesn't matter
Jed,so now just change language after every stock
Jed,Dope
Jed,Yup
Jed,can i just go back and forth on languages?
Jed,Yes
Jed,dope
Jed,can I interupt this process to play online
Jed,I have no idea
Jed,Or do I have to do the move thing again to start unlocking through language switcthing
Jed,just suck it up and play mad one stock games
Jed,It probably doesn't matter
Jed,I wanna play you before I have to go chris
Jed,Sauce up
Jed,Join up
Jed,@Ultimate

Jed,wow it's really easy to get to elite smash
Jed,man tho there's some dicks
Jed,I just got stuck in a free for all and two of the people just flat out teamed
Jed,I almost 1v2'd them

Jed,@Sak von Sak

Jed,@Ultimate

Jed,@Trapezoider
Jed,@Trapezoider
Jed,You are going to be waiting a long time lol
Jed,hello
Jed,ARE YOU GUYS HYPED FOR FINALS?
Jed,I'm hyped to be finishing school

Jed,"THATS WHY YOU GOTTA BE HYPE, YOU CANT BE STRESSED IF UR HYPED"

Jed,Sauce up that lobby
Jed,I can't finna join voice
Jed,???
Jed,Why not?
Jed,@Mr. Airplane unblock me
Jed,Nope
Jed,Yes
Jed,nope
Jed,One final down three to go
Jed,Looks like I'm changing mains in ultimate
Jed,Why?
Jed,Corrin's moves can't hit short characters
Jed,they go right over their head
Jed,I'm going to be a Shulk player now
Jed,does shulk not suck ass in ultimate?
Jed,pog
Jed,I've seen people placing him high on tier lists
Jed,no im not saying you're wrong
Jed,im just like
Jed,pog
Jed,Max most of corrins best moves hit short stuff
Jed,Down tilt
Jed,Pin
Jed,Nair
Jed,Bite
Jed,Shulk just does all the things I liked about Corrin better
Jed,That wasn't the only reason for switching
Jed,"But just so you know I meant that it was hard to kill short characters because fsmash and bair, which seem to be the two moves that kill the earliest, either don't hit short characters or are hard to land."
Jed,Young link is still gay confirmed
Jed,He can't be gay though
Jed,He wears pink
Jed,and gay men don't wear pink
Jed,the math checks out
Jed,the numbers dont lie
Jed,@Ultimate Anyone down to play?
Jed,10 mins then yes
Jed,just join up when ready
Jed,hot damn kingston sm4sh put out a PR for the game's entire lifespan and I juuuuust barely slid in
Jed,"and it's really funny for me looking at everyone above me and being like ""yup, yup, yup, better than me, yup, yup"" for everyone ranked above me... except andybulb"
Jed,which I'm basing entirely off the one time I fought him and booped him with captain falcon after not going to tournaments for like a year
Jed,I'm sure he's probably done really well around that but oh well
Jed,I'm still pretty happy I made it on this despite barely only really playing for like a year
Jed,of the like four-ish years that there was a scene
Jed,How did a Little Mac get so high
Jed,Isn't Little Mac like really bad
Jed,we had the best little mac in ontario
Jed,second best in canada
Jed,he 2-0'd the guy who was (at the time) #3 in ontario a few times
Jed,"dude the whole PR up until #7 is low tier with the exception of DK who's like, mid tier"
Jed,"the character spread is like
mid, low, low, low, low, low, very high, high, high, top, high, mid/high, low, mid, mid/low, top, top, low, low, low"
Jed,we were a weird city
Jed,is kingston just all zacks?
Jed,@Ultimate
Jed,Yee
Jed,After how bad I got roasted by max and Ava I'm quitting ultimate
Jed,No pls
Jed,Ava 3 stocked me with Pikachu

Jed,so its like a combo of the 2
Jed,oof
Jed,hahaha loser
Jed,"do it, you won't"
Jed,I already returned the game
Jed,Lame as fuck

Jed,:OmegaLUL:

Jed,Imagine unironically thinking that
Jed,Imagine being so conceited you cant even recognize when you are about to get raped
Jed,I 3 stocked you multiple times
Jed,Can you guys hold off on the match till I get home so I can get in voice chat while you play and listen to the shit talk live?
Jed,Were we playing the same game 
Jed,Ok hold on though
Jed,I also want to be in voice for that
Jed,we gotta schedule this match
Jed,Somebody has to do WWE voice casting
Jed,but I thought he returned the game
Jed,You guys can spectate the match
Jed,You cant return games
Jed,it was a joke
Jed,You can't return games you bought from the eshop
Jed,lol
Jed,oh yeah spectating is a thing in this game
Jed,Also I want to play y'all at some point
Jed,HELL YEAH BOIS
Jed,since when is a low tier match between two bad players deserving of all this hype?
Jed,If the ping permits
Jed,It's not about the skill level it's about the shit talk

Jed,Also you've got a garbo internship if you get no vacation
Jed,Unless it's a 4-month one
Jed,How can you be in debt at 18
Jed,Im not
Jed,In which case that's just kinda how the cookie crumbles
Jed,I had to buy a car which brought me down to 0

Jed,"and a whole bunch of things were basically just like
""You thought it was an email from your coworker, but it was hooded hackerman""
and a graphic of some random dude in a shirt and tie would peel back and this dude would be behind it"
Jed,I mostly just get a kick out of the idea of a generic hacker as a dude in a black hoodie with bright red sunglasses
Jed,eating dinner at 6 is like the most standard time to eat dinner
Jed,3:30 and 4 are very early y

Jed,why would just lie like that
Jed,jesus dude
Jed,  OVERWATCH IS FUN
Jed,Overwatch is fun ❗
Jed,i think people who dont like it are just focussed too much on the wrong aspects of the game
Jed,that's subjective
Jed,i mean
Jed,not really
Jed,It completely is
Jed,that's actually the truest thing you could say about anything
Jed,if you dont like ow youre just a fat gay idiot
Jed,i mean you could go a moba and i could say well you don't enjoy it
Jed,because your focusing on the wrong aspects
Jed,i mean sure
Jed,but thats
Jed,pretty retarded to say
Jed,yeah maybe the fun aspects arent what you're interested in
Jed,so you just dont like the game
Jed,fusion like feeding
Jed,^
Jed,you say this but im better than both of you lol

Jed,dva enables so much more interesting comps and playstyles
Jed,we just need more dva-like characters
Jed,"pharah, bastion, orisa, junkrat would all be broken if dva was banned, and these aren't fun or interesting characters to play when left unchecked"

Jed,Masteranime - Watch Anime Online Free
Jed,Masteranime - is an anime info database with a streaming option to watch anime in HD. Join the community to keep track of your watched anime and get to follow friends to see what they're watching.
Jed,Ooh thats a big spicy
Jed,Thank
Jed,"pretty much all of the anime streaming sites suck these days. They're all slow, low quality, and full of ads. You gotta torrent them yourself if you want quality."
Jed,I caNT ANYMORE
Jed,BECAUSE I USED TO PIRATE ALL THE TIME and now my ISP will rape me if I pirate again
Jed,
Jed,BIG sad
Jed,LOL
Jed,It was so dumb
Jed,I haven't had any issues with anime torrenting
Jed,I pirated BOTW to emulate
Jed,but that didnt matter because my MAJORAS MASK ROM was the final strike
Jed,lol stupid
Jed,How much do you have to pirate to get warned by your ISP?
Jed,but if anyone is curious the current anime torrent site I know of that works well is nyaa.si

Jed,https://clips.twitch.tv/ApatheticVenomousShieldPraiseIt
Jed,FRAN Playing Overwatch - Twitch Clips
Jed,Jeff Kaplan destroys players below Diamond - Clipped by akbierly
Jed,I really think that this argument is just false
Jed,metas in ow apply to basically every skill tier above like silver
Jed,like yeah other things can work in lower tiers
Jed,but if people just randomly decided to run goats they would still probably win
Jed,metas do not only rely on executing specific strategies but also the natural synergy between characters and the inherent strengths of characters
Jed,like dva is just really really good so you are more likely to win with a dva than without at basically every elo
Jed,yet the entire ow community seems to agree with Jeff here and uses this to argue about game balance like what
Jed,yea i can probably agree with you was Jeff just saying this relating to something else or what? @Mr. Airplane
Jed,he basically just said meta doesnt matter at plat and below
Jed,and then on reddit people were like 'yeah meta doesnt even really matter unless you're in like the top 5% of players'
Jed,Yeah that's retarded
Jed,"hmm i mean i think your both probably right but think it's more like gold and to a greater degree silver and below, because at that rank people just don't have any fundamentals so they rarely can make use of playing the character or the comp to their maximum potential. I do admit if a team were to play goats they would be more effective than just picking random hero's due to the innate usefulness of goats. Metas do apply but not because the players are good or can make use of the meta comp but more just due to the comp it self just being better than what they would pick normally that's probably my perspective"
Jed,bruh i literally just said that
Jed,read my wall of text
Jed,ok
Jed,smile
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,What's goats

Jed,daily vlogs    daily vlogs  
Jed,oops
Jed,????????????????
Jed,Dude what is going on
Jed,daily vlogs    daily vlogs  
Jed,
Jed,Yes
Jed,"What it mean when ya girl say """""
Jed,Oh
Jed,"kingston melee PR's out for this season, I can say with confidence I would have been on this if I was in kingston, based on the handul of tourneys I went to"
Jed,Where would you place yourself?
Jed,"I haven't played some of these people, but I'm say at least in the 7-9 range, possibly 6"
Jed,Also where would you place me?
Jed,Your region seems to lack good fox players.
Jed,"for the people I have played: 0-3 with dayman, 2-3 with momba, 0-1 with boo, 1-1 with deep in thot, 3-0 with sasquatch, 0-2 with dog, 1-0 with whom"
Jed,"I don't know honestly, I haven't gotten to play people all that much this season"
Jed,or you cause our connection's pretty bad
Jed,When you say 0-1 or 2-3 is that set count or game count?
Jed,sets
Jed,Are you going to bed soon or do you want to try some ultimate tonight?
Jed,D&D till bed
Jed,"but also I'm going to bed early no matter what, I'm starting to get a little sick so I want to make sure I get a good night's sleep"
Jed,"also, if it was in games, how would I be 0-1 or 1-0 or 1-1?"
Jed,Friendlies or a forfeit.
Jed,I guess forfeit could make sense
Jed,but I wouldn't count friendlies
Jed,I remember you saying something once about a guy reporting a score as 0 - -1
Jed,
Jed,Gottem
Jed,Nice job
Jed,Now I just gotta beat ceroas
Jed,fuck him up
Jed,We should do an Ultimate tourney when Kameron gets the game
Jed,Yes
Jed,@Ultimate
Jed,Probably with a character ban system like with melee
Jed,Also @Trapezoider don't be big gay
Jed,
Jed,Oh yeah he also has the game
Jed,Tournaments for this game will be cooler then our previous ones because we can host an arena for it and all the sets can be watched by the other players.
Jed,Im selling my switch mang
Jed,sorry
Jed,
Jed,unless zelda 2 gets announced
Jed,Just give it to Jed so he can play
Jed,
Jed,Or don't be big gay
Jed,I can imagine you selling your switch and then the very next day they announce the new Zelda game
Jed,YO 4TH
Jed,yeet
Jed,THATS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BUT DESERVED
Jed,@Trapezoider Don't sell yet
Jed,^
Jed,you gotta play more fam
Jed,mmm I was expecting like 5th
Jed,and had hopes of 4th
Jed,you thought maybe they would put you below jarek
Jed,yeah but that was fake I guess
Jed,I wasn't going off stats on that i was just worried he'd be biased in the decision time
Jed,but he wasn't
Jed,noice
Jed,yo I just did my math placement test and tested into math 250/260 thats good right?
Jed,what is math 250/260
Jed,cause its gonna depend based on the school
Jed,like what is the name
Jed,College algebra and trigonometry I guess?
Jed,Generally 2xx courses are second year so that's probably good
Jed,111 is college algebra at chemeketa
Jed,"It's GCU though, I imagine they have a different naming scheme? Unless you are secretly a GOD at math :D"
Jed,If it's the same as chemeketa that's calculus
Jed,And stats
Jed,I think they usually have similar naming systems
Jed,I thought so too but then I compared my community college to the state college I'm transferring to and everything was WACK
Jed,They literally had a whole website for translating which courses were equivelant between the schools
Jed,True
Jed,Maybe I lied
Jed,Idk the projected math course for me was 154 but the test said 250
Jed,Go on their website and find out which math that is
Jed,I'm curious
Jed,^
Jed,You might be a math God?
Jed,"Also Chris, thanks for help on math last year buddy. I used to hate it but now that I'm getting into the higher level stuff I'm really enjoying math!!!"
Jed,Applications of college algebra

Jed,@Mr. Airplane
Jed,We can't help you unless we see
Jed,"@Mr. Airplane I wouldn't grow your hair so long that people would say that you have ""long hair"" but less short then I remember you having would be fine."

Jed,@Max what's ur gsp
Jed,"I have no idea, it changes as the relative gsp of everyone else changes. So since I have not played in a few days it is probably different from what it was before by hundreds of thousands. I am in elite smash though, so if you are not at least that you aren't caught up yet."
Jed,im just wondering
Jed,^
Jed,I'll go check in a few minutes

Jed,

Jed,Oh didn't see that till now
Jed,"whoop whoop I don't think I""ve ever played any smash game as badly as I just played today"
Jed,that was an absolute shitshow
Jed,Rip
Jed,0-2?
Jed,yeah
Jed,against some garbage players
Jed,at least I've still got melee tomorrow
Jed,I really want to try ultimate competitively but I can't justify buying a switch
Jed,Just yoink Andrew's
Jed,He is selling it though
Jed,Exactly
Jed,So just yoink it
Jed,
Jed,andrew's selling his switch??
Jed,"Yeah, he's big gay"
Jed,wow what a retard
Jed,260 for 3 games and switch so issa good deal
Jed,And I did just get a $250 bonus but like I have school to pay for soon
Jed,buy it and resell the non ultimate games
Jed,Good idea
Jed,They are all digital though
Jed,oh
Jed,Yeah
Jed,Rip
Jed,Ok I don't know if this is good advice so take it with a grain of salt
Jed,Yeah you got school to pay for
Jed,But you also gotta treat yo self sometimes you feel
Jed,Yeah
Jed,Plus you got your entire school period to make money to pay for it
Jed,This is also true
Jed,"And in reality if everything works out the way I have planned I'll only actually be owing 3,000 out of pocket"
Jed,That ain't too too bad
Jed,Fingers crossed I can transfer to the Chipotle newar my school so I can get the reimbursement for the rest
Jed,Yeah it's hella good
Jed,Just don't come to me if this turns out to be a bad financial decision
Jed,
Jed,Also don't you have to pay for online monthly though?
Jed,Yeah but it's only $20 a year
Jed,Oh
Jed,We might also start a frostbite family plan
Jed,Plus if you do a family plan with the peeps in here it becomes a lot less
Jed,Ay nice
Jed,For example I'm only paying $8
Jed,@Ultimate Anyone?
Jed,No
Jed,Botw and Mario are physical
Jed,Oh shit
Jed,Only smash is digital
Jed,Yeah

Jed,gimmie a bit
Jed,no clue why people think that ike wont be good forever
Jed,its easy to camp out ike
Jed,and if he mispaces nair it's an easy edgeguard
Jed,since his defensive game isnt that strong
Jed,he has to approach
Jed,"Well I did pretty bad in pools, but at least there's an amateur bracket"
Jed,On the flip side I won the rock paper scissors tournament

Jed,@Homies
Jed,anyone taken linera algebra?
Jed,Me
Jed,Okay
Jed,Vector Quantization
Jed,Im trying to collapse a series of audio channels into a single 1 dimension vector. My research keeps pointing me to a method called vector quantization
Jed,I have the basics of what a vector is from this video
Jed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs
Jed,"Vectors, what even are they? | Essence of linear algebra, chapter 1"
Jed,"I imagine many viewers are already familiar with vectors in some context, so this video is intended both as a quick review of vector terminology, as well as ..."
Jed,but as soon as things get funky i get CONFUSED
Jed,You got any insight?
Jed,When do things get funkyÉ
Jed,?
Jed,Also I'm not sure I know what vector quantization is
Jed,So my author talks about vector quantization then Markov Chains?
Jed,Are these linear algebra things even???
Jed,URRRGg
Jed,❤
Jed,"If it has to do with vectors, yes"
Jed,
Jed,Markov chain sounds like it's just a way of seeing sequences of possible events
Jed,Vector quantization is definitly a linear algebra concept
Jed,@Mr. Airplane Might know more?
Jed,Bird boi!!!
Jed,Come hither
Jed,I have scooby snacks 
Jed,Hmm
Jed,A quick Google search reveals that vector quantization is also a statistics concept
Jed,For creating a probability density function
Jed,Well that explains why im confused
Jed,I know nothing about probability density functions
Jed,Im only in my first stats class this term
Jed,You're definitly going to learn about them there
Jed,Probably more towards the end though
Jed,We just covered measures of variance / the normal distribution
Jed,True
Jed,Do probability density functions get pretty difficult
Jed,because so far the class is easy
Jed,Not really
Jed,Cool
Jed,
Jed,Math is so cool
Jed,Agreed
Jed,markov chains is indeed linear algebra
Jed,but i learned that like half a year ago i dont remember any of it lol

Jed,it just felt super generic and the second half was basically like 6 episodes of story and a fuckton of padding
Jed,Really :0
Jed,yeah
Jed,it's my very own Unpopular Anime Opinion
Jed,(TM)
Jed,Certainly
Jed,I actually agree with Zack
Jed,
Jed,The last 20 episodes are a lot of ACTION
Jed,But I still adore the show
Jed,I love the soundtrack
Jed,I've learned most of it on piano
Jed,"action can rarely hold something up on its own, and FMA has pretty uninspired choreography"
Jed,and there's just so much random stuff that felt like they threw it in without having much of a reason beyond padding the episode count
Jed,Except for this fight scene... I think even you can agree this is top notch

Jed,Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Alphonse vs. Pride and Kimblee
Jed,Alphonse is a total badass! Subscribe to our channel for all the latest updates & videos! Website: http://www.animelab.com Like us on Facebook: http://www.fa...
Jed,yeah that was a decent fight
Jed,but for a show with as much fighting as there was nothing particularly standout
Jed,like you look at most decent shows with a lot of fights and there'll always be at least a few crazy awesome fights and FMA just kinda doesn't
Jed,"you look at like, 
Fate/ - saber vs lancer, kiritsugu vs kirei, shirou vs archer, etc etc etc
KLK - every ryuko vs satsuki fight but especially the first, the second proper ryuko vs nui fight, the episode and a half boat fight, etc etc etc
MHA: All might vs nomu, deku vs todoroki, etc etc etc"
Jed,even some shows with basically zero fighting have really damn good fights every now and then
Jed,see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2QkKGrTd6Y
Jed,Tohru vs Kanna
Jed,Anime: Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon

Jed,"I love how twitch chat is memeing ""take this"""
Jed,?
Jed,Richter goes TAKE THIS when he brings out the jesus water
Jed,ah I see
Jed,Why would you play Richter over Simon?
Jed,there's a few matchups where it's better cause of some weird property of the jesus water
Jed,that is the literal only difference between the two
Jed,Yeah but isn't the difference Simon's holy water has the fire property and Richter's doesn't
Jed,I don't really know how it works honestly
Jed,I think it's better to have one in some matchups? not sure
Jed,Why would you not want to have the fire property
Jed,or it might be that it only matters in some matchups
Jed,"cause it's all the same hitboxes, they both do the thing where you're eating a whole bunch of hits if you're in it"
Jed,it's just literally the type of damage
Jed,which has some weird niche effects
Jed,ARMADA VS APOLOGY MAN
Jed,BATTLE OF THE TITANS
Jed,thats a pog dude
Jed,Qucik question
Jed,When is the Superbowl

Jed,now that was hella lame
Jed,he just spins around
Jed,that aint cool
Jed,yo what

Jed,why watch melee when you could watch slap city
Jed,good question
Jed,one of my friends so badly wanted to go out to genesis for slap
Jed,but he's broke af
Jed,I'm still salty that slap city took stream priority over rivals
Jed,slap's actually pretty fun
Jed,yeah
Jed,"but like rivals isn't side event and it has a $13,000+ prizepool"
Jed,man's like top 2 fish in canada
Jed,but there's no money in slap
Jed,he's top 30 NA
Jed,Can the people actively watching genesis Please @me when leffen or m2k are on the ultimate stream?

Jed,I think 48
Jed,there's usually more people in loser's than winners
Jed,"there's a solid sm4sh set going on right now (zackray, the guy who's been dominating japan) vs sonix (hella wifi warrior), and it's a great set but I'm really upset that both commentators are saying 'utilize' instead of 'use'"

Jed,the smash elo system is dumb
Jed,why do i gain more for beating somebody way lower rank than me than when i lose to somebody slightly higher rank
Jed,If you're low elo you gain hella fast
Jed,They want to separate the crappy players
Jed,I've got the opposite atm
Jed,I gain like nothing and lose a lot of I lose
Jed,maybe its cause im playing a new character
Jed,"For the first few matches of a new character, elo gains and losses are significantly increased."
Jed,"Legit I was playing yesterday, went like 7-3 with my only losses to people with higher elo and at least 4 wins over people with higher elo, and went from 3.680 million to 3.682"
Jed,It's weird

Jed,Transitioning to freezing rain basically all day
Jed,I guess no midterm for me today
Jed,I wonder how many people will actually make it out to the office
Jed,My prediction is no more than 4 of the usual 15
Jed,I think I'm gonna work from home today
Jed,As I'm sitting here on a perfectly nice day getting ready for school. Sigh
Jed,I would rather have your weather - I left my laptop charger at work so I'm gonna have to go out today to buy one
Jed,In the cold and rain and ice and hail
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,you can work from home?
Jed,Thats legit
Jed,ATI wont give remote access under any circumstances
Jed,Do you just RDP back to your desktop or does your laptop have all your projects?
Jed,"Laptop has all my stuff, and I can connect to everything else remotely"
Jed,Feels fucking bad. I still have classes
Jed,
Jed,"Slogged my way to school. Freezing half dead and ready to give in. Next thing you know, i see other people at home playing apex while they have no class"
Jed,feelsbadman
Jed,@Zain
Jed,A classic
Jed,"Pffft I'm in a video meeting atm to discuss how our depart did in the last quarter, and at one point they go ""the number of people using our services have skyrocketed! This is mostly because we broadened the definition of what qualifies as an active user, but it sure does make our numbers look good"""
Jed,LOLOL
Jed,Thats brilliant
Jed,I love corporate bullshitery like that
Jed,"In all fairness, even with our old metrics we did well, but also our new metrics made us look even better"
Jed,"@Master Memers boys chris raw just pronouced Yosemite ""Yah-Meh-Set"""
Jed,Chris wtf
Jed,"""yah-meh-set"""
Jed,
Jed,I know it's pronounced weird but that's just awful
Jed,"""Yo-ze-mite"""
Jed,"my life in japanese is ""yamen-nasai"""
Jed,
Jed,apex legends is a pretty fun battle royal
Jed,"Okay, I just watched a video on this game and it looks like a lot of fun"
Jed,I'll have to see how the shooting mechanics work though to know if I can enjoy it for more then a few days
Jed,@TheRainbowpixelz How does the game make money?
Jed,Do you start with all characters or do you have to buy them?
Jed,All but 2 characters are unlocked
Jed,All legends are sorta balanced.
Jed,I'd yet because  I've only played it for less than an hour
Jed,Ttk is mid to high. Guns feel super satisfying  to shoot
Jed,Game makes money by cosmetic  microtransactions. Since the game is ftp it gets a half pass
Jed,If all it sells are cosmetics that is amazing to me
Jed,As long as it aint loot boxes
Jed,Fingers crossed that ea doesn't pull an activision
Jed,It is loot boxes
Jed,As long as the majority of the gameplay content is not locked behind a paywall I'm game
Jed,smh
Jed,I do not care even a little how my character looks so I don't care how they do the cosmetics
Jed,^
Jed,I just want good and accessible gameplay
Jed,Have you played Titan fall?
Jed,no
Jed,OK then don't worry. The movement feels as crisp as cod
Jed,Never played cod either
Jed,Battlefield?
Jed,yeah
Jed,3
Jed,Battlefield but more responsive
Jed,No suppression. Some bullet drop and travel
Jed,noooooo
Jed,I hate that so much
Jed,It's nothing basically hits can but not  hitscan
Jed,I'll probably download it tomorrow
Jed,3 man squads only. Which is a dowbside
Jed,But fun game
Jed,Not sure of my pc can run it but I have a new graphics card that I have not installed yet so that should help if I can't.
Jed,Who does parties of 3
Jed,It runs on a modified source engine
Jed,yo
Jed,awesome
Jed,I get roughly 148 average fps
Jed,On low
Jed,I'm more worried about it functioning at all
Jed,How much fos you get in cs
Jed,I literally never check fps
Jed,I don't care as long as the game works without lag

Jed,Because bad maybe?
Jed,Shooting feels terrible
Jed,bullet drop and travel time
Jed,I hate those so much and don't play any games that have them

Jed,and you're just adding to the bunch
Jed,no one cares about your annoying little crew
Jed,"fuck off ava you don't do shit in here, we kick the people after we are done playing with them unless they're chill and we want to keep playing games with them"
Jed,which I believe is the point of this server
Jed,I actually do talk in here semi-frequently thank you very much
Jed,and why even invite people if you literally plan to kick them
Jed,just make a group DM?? duh
Jed,"Damn just calm down boys and girls it's all good where just here to have some fun in the end, no need to start shit if you guys have some complaints just talk to me in DM instead of starting a flame war in chillin or don't do whatever you want lol."

Jed,Yee
Jed,But later tho
Jed,I am ready to refine my new main
Jed,I got family over
Jed,Who is your new main?
Jed,Young Link
Jed,Why?
Jed,"Because while I really like Cloud and saw great results with him against  people worse then me, you need to hit most of your limits with him in order to beat people that are as good as or better then you. Limit is not something you can really combo into, so it requires a read to hit. Getting reads like that has always been something that I've been bad at compared to everything else. Young Link does not require reads in the same way to do well and also has a really awesome combo game, good projectiles, and a better recovery."

Jed,"Its kind of unfortunate that the one part of our body that must always be kept exposed, our eyes, is so close to the one part of our bodies that must absolutely be protected, our brain."
Jed,it makes it harder to damage something that would cause us to lose some or all of our vision
Jed,cause there's fewer connecting parts that could be damaged
Jed,also faster reaction times
Jed,@Mr. Airplane  :-(
Jed,Did not think of the first one but I have considered the second point. I'm just not sure how much faster it would be.
Jed,"not much, which was why I brought it up as more of an afterthought"
Jed,but generally most of our sensory stuff is on our heads so it might be some of that
Jed,I dunno honestly
Jed,I'm guessing more of my original first point
Jed,@Jed
Jed,Brb
Jed,A lot of sensory stuff is also in the spinal cord
Jed,Most reflexes that we do come from it
Jed,@Jed
Jed,You here???
Jed,Can hear?
Jed,Also I do think that the speed is important enough
Jed,the spinal stuff is mostly for body senses something -> body reacts without mental processing stuff
Jed,Correct
Jed,so I guess that could work
Jed,as a counterpoint
Jed,hm
Jed,The brain still gets information though
Jed,just later yeah
Jed,Just to let it know what it's doing
Jed,For posture and stuff
Jed,so I think I'm gonna stick with the protecting the connecting bits theory

Jed,She's a Genius!
Jed,oh ew
Jed,that's lame
Jed,whoever wrote that is stupid
Jed,
Jed,sorry @Trapezoider @Jed i ended up having a long winded discussion with my friends about killing babies
Jed,Abortion?
Jed,I hope
Jed,no
Jed,killing living babies
Jed,You mean that New York law?
Jed,no
Jed,just in general
Jed,wait what did new york do
Jed,You can kill a newborn through neglect and it will be legally considered abortion
Jed,that's... not a good law
Jed,that's a pretty terrible law
Jed,Wait what the fuck
Jed,That is horrible
Jed,Who
Jed,The fuck
Jed,Thanks for at least being reasonable on this
Jed,aren't you not even allowed abortions past a certain point in the pregnancy
Jed,Voted for that
Jed,because it starts getting enough brain to be at least somewhat conscious
Jed,Different states can decide the point at which abortion is allowed
Jed,how in the fuck
Jed,"is a completely born, living baby"
Jed,What argument could there possibly be for this law???
Jed,not considered alive enough that that's a motherfucking problem
Jed,I have no idea how this passed
Jed,This is actually rediculous. Do you have a source for this?
Jed,let me find one real quick
Jed,Thanks crazy extremist left
Jed,nah our argument was more like theoretical
Jed,
Jed,Perhaps some of the things I heard were exaggerations but an abortion when there should be a delivery is still pretty sad
Jed,Not ruling out what I said as impossible though
Jed,Yeah q
Jed,based on that's it's just legal until birth
Jed,Still crazy either way
Jed,which is still a little sketchy
Jed,but not anywhere near as crazy
Jed,I think the after birth thing was a law currently being debated in Virginia based on what I read
Jed,I think that's actually discusting still
Jed,yeah
Jed,but in comparison it's not as bad
Jed,They are pretty equal
Jed,depends on the timeframe of letting neglect kill your baby counting as an abortion
Jed,It could be only seconds separating the time of death
Jed,"Even if you don't want it, just put it up for adoption"
Jed,"neglect would normally be like not feeding it, so I don't think it'd be seconds"
Jed,I'm pretty sure the neglect thing real or not was to be done only right after birth
Jed,seconds would be the doctor fucking up
Jed,"but yeah, still quite fucked up"
Jed,If you don't make a baby breath it can suffocate in seconds
Jed,I know someone who is mentally disabled because the doctor couldn't make him breath soon enough
Jed,"wouldn't have thought of that as neglect, but I dunno how the law looks at it"
Jed,I was thinking neglect being parental
Jed,anything else is just the doctor not being fast/good enough
Jed,"you do understand nobody carries the baby up to full term and then decides at the last second, the law is put in place for babies that will die soon after birth due to debilitating complications"
Jed,still a weird way of handling it
Jed,idk i think its perfectly fine
Jed,in the end its the parents choice
Jed,I guess the choice of the child doesn't matter then
Jed,"well i mean the ""child"" isnt actually like  a person yet"
Jed,so
Jed,they dont have one?
Jed,It's still a living breathing human being
Jed,Not everyone sees personhood as starting at the same time
Jed,it's not like they can make a choice at that point in life
Jed,i mean its not like you're offing a person who has lived a life and had experiences
Jed,and it's basically assisted suicide
Jed,which is a totally different argument
Jed,that kind of makes it worse
Jed,its like im deteling a game save that didnt have an data on it not like im deleteing a 100% completion run
Jed,You are denying them the choice
Jed,that I don't feel like having right now cause I'm real tired and should probably get to sleep and also I don't know my own stance on it
Jed,Would it be sadder to see a 5 year old die who has had no chance at life or a 100 year old with a life fully lived
Jed,"it's basically: yes you're denying them the choice, but also you're making the choice to doom them to a short life of misery"
Jed,both of which are shitty options
Jed,"regardless, I'm going to sleep"
Jed,goodnight
Jed,i mean both are about the same if you ask me?
Jed,i mena people die
Jed,shit ahppens
Jed,Yeah but not always purposefully
Jed,That's like saying it's alright if I murder my neighbour so who cares?
Jed,well an unborn baby =/= your neighbour
Jed,your neighbours is like actually a person
Jed,"""people die all the time"""
Jed,max said 5 year old vs 100 year old
Jed,idk where that argument was going but i was answering it
Jed,look i dont wanna argue about it cause nobody is gonna change their opinion about anything and itll just end in people being grumpy so ima drop it
Jed,I mean we don't really get grumpy from political debates here but I understand why you don't wanna argue
Jed,i cant tell tone is this like an offhanded roast or a genuine comment
Jed,Genuine comment
Jed,I don't know if everyone already knows or not but plup got into summit
Jed,You are denying those people the opportunity to exist
Jed,There is the potential for a life full of wonderful conscious experiences
Jed,@Sak von Sak
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL
Jed,pls join
Jed,
Jed,I'm
Jed,At work
Jed,O
Jed,Kay
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL come play big gai
Jed,In like 10 minutes
Jed,Jk more like 25
Jed,Fuck you
Jed,
Jed,jk tho
Jed,
Jed,since no one knows what time human becomes a human it's safest to assume that they are a human at conception so you can't abort anything if you could determine at what time a person becomes a person you wouldn't have this argument when we have something as valuable as life on the line i would rather be safe then sorry that's my position. @Max @Sak von Sak @Eric Working From Home @The Rona
Jed,I think abortion should be legal up to 2500 weeks
Jed,Yo that's 48 years
Jed,Yes
Jed,exactly
Jed,Also I agree with Zain
Jed,But in all seriousness I agree with Zain as well
Jed,"Considering that your brain is pretty much one of the first things that begins development, I would argue you ""become a person"" pretty early on"
Jed,i mean even if you are arguing that it is a person and not an anomaly (im probably using that word wrong) the value of a life isnt that high imo
Jed,"An anomaly would be something that isn't standard, so I don't really know what you mean by that?"
Jed,A fetus is a pretty normal thing
Jed,uhh
Jed,hello boss?
Jed,considering a zygote contains all the information necessary for a complete human to form I think that is when you are human
Jed,If there was a completely painless and cost free way to remove a zygote from the womb and grow it externally without harming the mother I think there becomes no moral arguement for abortion
Jed,change my mind
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL
Jed,@Bitmin
Jed,are you guys still here?
Jed,I got yoted?
Jed,i mean what would even be the point of going to those lengths to create a person
Jed,That's what plan B does right?
Jed,Because it is better to live than to never have the chance to exist
Jed,there are so many people in the world and we are so insignificant that to think we actually matter is narcissistic and delusional
Jed,And creating more concious minds is the moral imperative
Jed,like if i died tomorrow would it matter
Jed,no
Jed,Yes it would
Jed,Because you matter
Jed,i care about u dober
Jed,thats the poiont in tryna make
Jed,nobody matters
Jed,u matter to me
Jed,But that's not true
Jed,^
Jed,Thats not true
Jed,Every life matters. Conciousness is the only thing that matters. Maybe the universe doesnt assign us any meaning at birth
Jed,"If you have the mindset that you don't matter, then you probably won't ever do anything that matters. But if you live your life with the mindset of doing something that matters and had an impact somewhere, you probably will achieve that to some scale"
Jed,But it could be said that humans and more generally conscious creatures are the ONLY thing that matters
Jed,"i'm all for killing babies, but i don't like letting women have a choice"

Jed,Pinned a message.
Jed,so in DnD spiders have a strength of 2
Jed,meaning they can life 30 pounds (reduced to 15 due to their size)
Jed,a single spider can carry 15 pounds

Jed,Crawls into your womb and just carries them out
Jed,you have made me feel a feeling i never want to feel again

Jed,owl
Jed,"on friday, we had an office lunch thing where our manager took us all out for lunch, I ended up sitting next to the manager and one of the full timers and got to listen to them spend the entire lunch talking about weed"
Jed,Is weed legal where you live?
Jed,yeah
Jed,its legal in all of canada
Jed,it's legal canada-wide
Jed,but you need a license to sell it and only a tiiiiiiny handful of places have gotten some yet
Jed,so most available weed is still illegal
Jed,well illegal to sell not illegal to be in possesion of right?
Jed,yeah
Jed,you can also grow your own
Jed,how many plants?
Jed,but only up to a maximum of like 4 plants or something
Jed,I think in Oregon its 5
Jed,Why would there be a plant restriction?
Jed,my family almost ended up growing weed for one of my mum's friends who is basically incapable of not killing houseplants
Jed,"it's basically to make it so you can't grow and sell easily, you have enough for a household who are all using but not really enough to sell it"
Jed,or at least I think that's why
Jed,plant restriction so the entire population of canada doesnt get addicted
Jed,but 5 plants if a fuck ton lmao
Jed,weed's not addictive tho
Jed,^
Jed,i know but
Jed,How big is a weed plant?
Jed,sketchy dealers will sometimes lace it with addictive stuff but if you grow your own it's just weed
Jed,"I honestly have no idea, but I think they grow pretty low to the ground so I'd assume not big"
Jed,"they're closer to, y'know, weeds than regular plants"
Jed,i thought the idea is that individuals mass growing weed doesnt screw with the price
Jed,that makes more sense honestly
Jed,I mean oregon has too much weed now lmao
Jed,oregon has to grow it for the other states 
Jed,You are allowed to plants per person over 18 in a household
Jed,oh damn not bad
Jed,we might have been growing 6-8 plants then
Jed,Oh the age is probably 18 to smoke there huh?
Jed,"I would have thought 19, same as drinking age, but I dunno"
Jed,Eief way still better than 21
Jed,You can't even vape or smoke tobacco products till 21 in Oregon now

Jed,"I am 13. Just my grandpa and I are staying down at his shack at the moment. I've been sleeping with no clothes on for the passed few nights because it feels better and my grandpa doesn't come into my room much, so he wouldn't know. But this morning I accidentally slept in so grandpa came in to wake me up. I had morning wood (an erection in the morning that is caused in your sleep) and I had kicked the covers off during the night so I was laying there naked, with a hard-on (how embaressing!!). Grandpa quickly went out of the room and we weren't talking because it was awkward. Then later on today I was wanking off in the bathroom (which doesn't have a lock) when I thought my grandpa was outside. He walked in just as I was ejaculating and groaning with . One day doesn't get much more embaressing than that!! How unlucky. My grandpa and I haven't talked for seven hours now. What should I say to him?"

Jed,Played a bunch already today sorry. I played some Ike as a part of my journey to try all the top tiers and also went on a huge winning streak with puff (who ended up higher GSP than Ike lol).
Jed,pfft nice
Jed,Can confirm that puff dittos are still really boring
Jed,I got one
Jed,@Sak von Sak hell yeah buddy
Jed,Then we should do gen 7
Jed,still gotta finish gen 7
Jed,but yeah
Jed,You should do that
Jed,Then later we can do gen 8
Jed,
Jed,What gen is the newest one?
Jed,They announced 8 today
Jed,See the pokemon I posted earlier today
Jed,Those starters are super ugly
Jed,they're not stellar
Jed,TAHNK YOU
Jed,I kinda like the water one tho
Jed,Nobody here likes my boy Grookey 
Jed,water and fire are aight but grookey is so bad it drags htem down with it
Jed,he's second best but not really particularly notable
Jed,fingers crossed for kameron liking the fire one and then if we do gen 8 we all get the starter we want
Jed,He's literally a baby monkey
Jed,So cute
Jed,I the the fire one too
Jed,I think he is the best of the three but still kinda bad

Jed,Report: Amazon will pay $0 in federal taxes this year
Jed,"Amazon won't pay a cent in federal taxes this year, according to a report by a watchdog group.  The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy(ITEP) reports that Amazon, in fact, is getting a $129 million rebate, meaning they will effectively pay a negative one percent tax rate."
Jed,Yikes
Jed,Big business privilege
Jed,Have not read a ton on this but I think they helped write the tax laws that made this possible
Jed,Why do we let this happen
Jed,Cause we don't want them moving to a different country and losing jobs
Jed,But it's still really not a good way to go about it
Jed,i mean it's free speech dude the speech that says heres 10 million dollars lets write some laws deff not a bribe btw
Jed,lol

Jed,@Homies @Eric Working From Home Just found out that tabletop simulator has a bunch of full magic the gathering sets on the workshop and I want to play the game again. Feel free to @ me if anyone wants to play.
Jed,That'd be fun we could play like with the battledecks or have a draft/commander night
Jed,im not huge on draft tho
Jed,not a fan of commander but I would be down for draft or sealed
Jed,haha
Jed,oh lol
Jed,We could do 6 packs from an old set
Jed,if people play draft ill play dont get me wrong
Jed,prerelease style
Jed,ah okay
Jed,never been to a prerelease
Jed,they are fun
Jed,I went to the magic origins one
Jed,i liked that set
Jed,I think that this format would be best because I doubt we will get enough for draft.
Jed,Prerelease format works with any player count
Jed,fair
Jed,We could pick an old classic set like Innistrad or Zendikar
Jed,innistrad best plane with best planeswalker as its guardian dont @ me
Jed,My favorite set personally was Khans of Tarkir
Jed,oh im jsut ta;lking lore

Jed,Will you have mega free time tomorrow?
Jed,I'll have a computer then hopefully
Jed,yes
Jed,Not sure if you are interested but I would be super down to play some Magic the gathering on tabletop
Jed,Any amount would work for sealed but we need at least 6 for a proper draft
Jed,I don't think playing a constructed format would be a good idea
Jed,The way magic works on tabletop would make it complicated and inconvenient
Jed,@Zain Do you know how to play magic or would you be learning?
Jed,I would play sealed or draft
Jed,@deleted-role anyone down?
Jed,"@Homies We are playing magic the gathering on tabletop simulator tomorrow. Feel free to come and join whether you have played before or are new to the game as anyone who has played can teach you before we start. For those who know what this means, we will be playing either sealed or draft as constructed is inconvenient to play on tabletop."
Jed,why dont we just play rn
Jed,I guess I could try on my laptop
Jed,he has his laptop
Jed,tabletop sim is not too resource intensive
Jed,which is better than his pc anyways
Jed,We could at least teach Zain tonight
Jed,not sure if everyone would want to play on this short notice
Jed,@Zain interested?

Jed,I think because his name got leaked.
Jed,I mean he has already told people in this discord
Jed,Now everyone knows
Jed,Wait what is it
Jed,^
Jed,Zade
Jed,^
Jed,The people he told he lied to.

Jed,@Mr. Airplane of course you wanna play rivals now that I'm not at home
Jed,I could play keyboard kragg on shitty wifi though 
Jed,JED
Jed,FOCUS ON YOUR PAPER
Jed,!!!!
Jed,Nah I'm about to finish my project
Jed,Then the paper
Jed,I'm also writing a paper
Jed,The alternative energy paper
Jed,"After researching it, I'm not really sure why people like to hype up wind and solar, as they seem like the two worst options."
Jed,Nuclear >
Jed,Solar efficiency has a moores law and will be superior in the coming years
Jed,Because they are renewable
Jed,Sure they aren't very good
Jed,But they are effective in the long run
Jed,I'm saying that there are better renewables
Jed,Also solar technology will only improve
Jed,the basic idea is that it's a one-time cost you can stick pretty much wherever
Jed,hydroelectric is probably best but you can only stick it in certain places
Jed,and become cheaper while still harnessing energy at a higher efficiency
Jed,you can just shove solar panels on a roof and get a decent amount of energy
Jed,Utilities companies will never accept that
Jed,They will lose a lot of revenue
Jed,they can't entirely stop you as far as I know
Jed,They can lobby against it
Jed,I wrote another paper on that
Jed,even on personal property and stuff?
Jed,damn that's dumb
Jed,If you have solar pannels you have to sell the energy back to the grid
Jed,"Or if you use the power yourself, and don't use the grid"
Jed,You have to pay for the power that you would have used
Jed,well
Jed,that's dumb
Jed,indeed
Jed,I am fairely sure that is how it currently works atleast in Ontario
Jed,Hooray for lobbying
Jed,"I know at my house we just pay for an alternate provider who gets their stuff from renewable sources, which is an option but I don't think they generate enough total energy to supply a particularly large number of people"
Jed,"basically we just take energy and they pump that much more into the grid (and pay a bit extra, so we also pay a bit extra)"
Jed,lol marss camera tricked himself
Jed,To me it looked like he did neutral B instead of down B

Molly: lv49 Metagross (died to a crit)
Boomer: lv48 Wailord (died to a crit)
Snek: lv46 Dragonite (got ice beam'd)
(also brought 3 garbo pokemon)

Progress: Agatha three mons down"
Jed,Will Chris finally win one?
Jed,almost certainly
Jed,we introduced some new rules for elite four to prevent stalling and it kinda depends on how far kameron makes it
Jed,aight chris just won
Jed,Why would you ever want to stall in a race?
Jed,"if everyone else loses, winning strat is to just grind till you're overleveled and then make it further"
Jed,so we changed the rules so the first person to reach the elite four doesn't have to make it as far to win

Jed,Yeah
Jed,It was just revealed  yesterday and I was reading about it
Jed,seems mega stupid
Jed,Yeah but you said it took like 20 gb per hour or something crazy right?
Jed,Supposedly
Jed,I didn't look too deep into it
Jed,But its supposed to stream the game from the cloud
Jed,Which I think means it runs the game from the cloud
Jed,Yeah
Jed,SO I think the  idea is you dont need a device to process it you can just play from anything that can stream it
Jed,or rather you dont need a good device
Jed,Yeah
Jed,So I found a little more

Jed,everytime he gets a haircut it looks like its only cut back by 1cm
Jed,kameron likes his hair long because he loses 1 cm of pingo for every 1 cm of hair
Jed,^
Jed,its a 1:1 hair to pingo reverse relationship
Jed,"f(p) = p * -h
Where f(p) is a function of the relationship between
p (pingo length)"
Jed,h (hair length)

Jed,The open A.I bot that could produce extremely realistic written text did a debut on reddit
Jed,It would respond to everyones comment with a paragraph of text
Jed,"Heres what it said to me saying 
""In the beginning man made memes."""
Jed,"OUTPUT:
The internet was meant to let us enjoy those memes because we saw them. In their mind man made memes was as much an expression of man's self to be seen as any other. This is a sad state of affairs and we see it again and again in the work of art.When a new art forms is created men take what they need to reproduce the original. They put in what they can, this will bring the art back, and this will lead to new art forms. This works like ""We need to love something and enjoy it"" but it is an extension of the original. It is the same with art.> 
This process creates new forms of artistic expression. This is what the ""songs of history"" are all about. It creates new forms of expression. I would much like to hear about these great works that are being created through this process. They are all in this world. People like you that love art will listen to the work of these artists and create a great work of work. I would like to hear about some of these great works through your community. Here's what you can do to help. Take a look. A man made meme> 
This is how the creator of these works came to get his name. This is an interesting thing. If you don't know this guy, the Internet is really the most amazing thing ever to happen to the internet. People have created a new art form to be reproduced in and around our public spaces. Now all we see is this guy being made a poster and that's it.> 
You know this meme is great and you just want to help a few people. Here are some links to help you out. This is why we are so hard at work to create the memes we deserve. If you want to know more on this and more great works about this we're here to help.> 
The Art of Making> 
And this is a must get for everyone at work. If you are one of the lucky few you will get a copy of The Art of Making. We've put together this guide to help you make sure everyone has a copy of The Art of Making. We hope it helps you too!

Jed,I found a no kap in the wild
Jed,safe now
Jed,?
Jed,spoilery things in another channel
Jed,@Neurotic you a bitch
Jed,jk u a nice guy
Jed,i never understand these sentiments
Jed,it seems like every person on reddit agrees with and spouts this garbage
Jed,Yeah
Jed,This isn't even true
Jed,like yeah you CAN do well with low tiers
Jed,People be dumb
Jed,but it PROBABLY WONT BE FUN
Jed,Falco laser spam is arguably better at low level for example
Jed,YOUR CHARACTER LITERALLY HAS LESS OPTIONS
Jed,= LESS FUN
Jed,also most people probably consider winning kinda fun
Jed,the second part of this post just isn't even true
Jed,"most people can identify what makes a character good pretty easily, even people who don't understand the game"
Jed,"ie chrom kills early and is fast, ylink has projectiles"
Jed,But Kirby cant die 4Head
Jed,I built a machine learning pipeline that can predict with 70% accuracy how many defects one of the parts we are going to produce will have
Jed,Feelsgoodman
Jed,Whats everyone up to these days>
Jed,?
Jed, 
Jed,Wrote a lab report on the BMR of mice
Jed,We is BMR?
Jed,Big Mega Roast?
Jed,Basal metabolic rate
Jed,What were the conclusions of your lab results?
Jed,Basically how much energy your body needs to run at rest
Jed,A mouse uses about 7.625cal/hr/g
Jed,So 7.625 calories per hour
Jed,per gram of body weight it has
Jed,How does one calculate these metabolic rates?
Jed,In laymans terms please
Jed,❤
Jed,"I'll tell you later, I'm in my lab now"
Jed,@here how do i get rid of this bullshit in the corner
Jed,No idea it seems like a new 'feature'
Jed,hover over it
Jed,and there should be an X
Jed,in the corner
Jed,THERES NO X
Jed,then you lost gg
Jed,guess im just gay
Jed,problem solved guys
Jed,its a bug
Jed,not a feature lol
Jed,Too bad you have the gay now
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL ive got that shit too
Jed,howd you fix
Jed,prob just restart ?
Jed,i didnt fix it
Jed,waiting on discord to fix it
Jed,Results from survey
Jed,n = 91 (so far)
Jed,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot surgeon to perform a critical surgery. (Heart Transplant, Gastric Bypass, Spinal Poliomyelitis Surgery, Surgical Ventricular Restoration ETC...)"
Jed,
Jed,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot to perform basic Nursing duties (pre-post operational care, taking: pulses, temperatures, blood pressures, monitoring and administering medication and intravenous infusions)"
Jed,
Jed,Do you feel an Artificially Intelligent Robot could provide emotional support during recovery?
Jed,
Jed,Do you think a ban should be placed on Artificially Intelligent Robots preventing them from entering the healthcare workforce to prevent medical professionals from being ousted from their jobs?
Jed,
Jed,Would you trust the diagnosis of an Artificially Intelligent Doctor?
Jed,
Jed,Looks like I was in the minority for those last three
Jed,It appears the general consensus (If this sample is representative at all) is that a reasonable portion of people are comfortable with SOME form of A.I assistance in healthcare
Jed,same
Jed,for what chrius said
Jed,@Trapezoider I think a resonable interpretation of this data would be if A.I assistance in healthcare was proven to be a benifit based upon evidence people would be comfortable in using it on themselves that's why a mojarity would say maybe i think
Jed,Yeah
Jed,What
Jed,There isn't really enough data on this for people to have informed opinions
Jed,"For me, as someone who knows how far the academic research has advanced, I can see how application of A.I is superior in many different medical domains  when compared to the best human Doctors. For the layman however, they don't have knowledge of the ground breaking developments  to answer these questions knowledgeably"
Jed,yea i think the reason there are so many maybes is because either the data is not there or people don't know enough about the data
Jed,yea exactly
Jed,that's why i think if people knew what maybe you did there would a lot more yes's rather then all the maybes but i could deff be reading a lot more into the data then i should be
Jed,I think the sample size is too  small to be too confident in our answer
Jed,"As far as sample sizes go, this is pretty good"
Jed,i mean this is deff not a good representation of the population my dude at least not this server
Jed,Yeah
Jed,Im gonna see if I can send it to people at work
Jed,I could easily get 800 responses from this plant alone
Jed,I think of all the questions a consensus should be reached about the first question. Human Surgeons make mistakes and some of those mistakes are sometimes fatal. It would be universally better to have ai or nano bots or whatever performing that part of the medical process. Thats the part people fuck up the most on lol\
Jed,Agreed
Jed,Now the A.I community needs to figure out how to explain to the public the work they are doing
Jed,It should be simple lol guess not
Jed,It's not simple to explain this stuff in a way that people trust
Jed,unfortunately the reason for that is cause generally people are uneducated on the subject
Jed,Even though I'm demonstrating empirically superior analytics at my Internship (compared to our business analyst team) I am encountering strong opposition to Machine Learning
Jed,Precisely
Jed,It's gonna take a lot of time to shift the zeitgeist on this issue
Jed,Thanks Alot Stephen Hawking scared everybody in the 90s
Jed,@Trapezoider stop using big words u stupid idiot
Jed,yeah
Jed,ya dumb
Jed,^
Jed,but like unironically using words like that makes you sound like you carry around a pocket thesaurus
Jed,He does
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,Its some fucking r/iamverysmart shit
Jed,I think that was an appropriate use of the word for the actually meaning that would not have  a good substitute to get his point across
Jed,"""zeitgeist"""
Jed,how bout popular opinion
Jed,actually zeitgeist does not even make sense in that context
Jed,because it refers to something from the past
Jed,and this is the present
Jed,so popular opinion actually makes way more sense
Jed,^
Jed,
Jed,It doesnt only apply to the past lol
Jed,Did you read the definition at allÉ
Jed,?
Jed,well we don't know what the zeitgeist of the current time is until the current time is over so it kinda does
Jed,I cant read
Jed,
Jed,"also the word is usually used to refer to historic timeframes, example ""the 60s"""
Jed,Reading hurt my pee pee
Jed,"""demonstrating empirically superior analytics"""
Jed,this just word salad
Jed,I dont wanna get hung up on semantics but and im not saying the way he said things was good or bad but i think it is fine to use big words to describe specifics if it makes sense
Jed,im just saying that if you talk that way dumb people are gonna think you're smart and smart people will probably think you're dumb
Jed,Fair
Jed,"I just hate the negaive look on ""big words"" use them if you can and they make sense"
Jed,i would change that to use them if you need to for it to make sense
Jed,'big words' typically will have very specific use cases
Jed,Or just don't overuse them in everyday speech
Jed,using them whenever you can will make your speech more confusing
Jed,Like an essay or a paper etc.
Jed,even then
Jed,But it real life its like trying to up the word count
Jed,you shouldn't use big words in a essay just to sound smart
Jed,you should use them if they're meaning aligns with the message you are trying to convey
Jed,In an essay big words can be used effectively to describe the 'seriousness' of the situation
Jed,eh
Jed,But again there's a limit to that
Jed,i dunno about that
Jed,Just don't overdo it
Jed,Hey Kameron
Jed,How about you eat cock
Jed,there is a difference between big words and formal language
Jed,Zeitgeist was the appropriate word
Jed,Literally false
Jed,it clearly wasn't
Jed,
Jed,Read it and weep
Jed,It clearly was
Jed,"""Current believes and ideas of the time"""
Jed,of the time
Jed,i.e.
Jed,The past
Jed,2010's is a time period
Jed,I am conducting this survey now to see how things evolve over time
Jed,"yeah but its not even a ""defining spirit or mood"""
Jed,10 years from now the zeitgeist around A.I and A.I in healthcare will be entirely different
Jed,fear of ai is not a defining spirit of the 2010s
Jed,Yeah but we as people in the present have a poor understanding of the majority consensus on topics
Jed,It is in my circles
Jed,Fear of A.I is one of the most discussed topics of the people I work and hangout with
Jed,My intellectual life is dominated by this topic
Jed,Man andrew you're really smart
Jed,Man Kameron you're a really big asshole
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,Ill make that asshole gape a little wider
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,"But Kameron, what I was saying about big words in an essay was essentially the idea you said"
Jed,"I'm sorry if you feel I'm tossing together a word salad, but this is the world I live in. Bullshit meetings and emails and fucking retarded standardization of everything"
Jed,I just didn't know how to express it
Jed,hence the quotations around the word seriousness
Jed,yeah
Jed,Everyone at work ACTUALLY emails and talks like that
Jed,Andrew have you heard of the theory of great filters as connected to the Fermi Paradox?
Jed,Yes I have
Jed,I think it is entirely likely that surviving AI could be the final filter that nothing passes
Jed,Maybe A.I is the bottleneck that prevents most civilizations from becoming intergalatic
Jed,This is why I'm entering the field. I want to ensure we build safe A.I and don't destroy everything we care about
Jed,I think that's the idea
Jed,We develop alternate realities
Jed,That we live in entirely
Jed,i.e. they are so advanced that we think it's reality
Jed,eg. the Matrix
Jed,That we kind of just forget about progression and stuff
Jed,Who knows where all this is going
Jed,All bets are off the table
Jed,"Go read Perfect State by Brandon Sanderson, it's basically that idea"
Jed,Sorry let me phrase that in words kameron will like
Jed,Also its only like 60 pages
Jed,I think that finding and increasing the genetic basis for IQ in humans would be a far safer approach to increase our scientific progress then creating AI.
Jed,all gambling activities have after careful consideration been labeled not available as actionable items in the workplace environment
Jed,?????????????????????????????
Jed,That's what I call a fucking word salad
Jed,much better
Jed,holy shit
Jed,@Max
Jed,I disagree
Jed,It's an interesting take on how a matrix-like system could work in a way beneficial to the happiness of mankind but at the cost of other stuff and all around its a solid story
Jed,"Andrew, what is your view on transhumanism?"
Jed,I don't think you can get enough of an increase in intelligence from using CRISPR to edit genes. Brains are about as big as they can be due to birth canal size. I think the way to go is high bandwidth brain interfaces. A third neo-cortex in the words of Kurzweil
Jed,"I think transhumanism is dogmatically adhered to too much, especially by silicon valley type people. Transhumanism is a good goal to aim for, but with some asteriks* to ensure we don't accidentally destroy ourselves (genetically engineering superhumans---->super bug that wipes out everyone etc..)"
Jed,I'm off lunch break boys. Have a nice day. Thank you for keeping my mind busy with fun discussions ❤
Jed,@Mr. Airplane @The Rona  I think that when ever your trying to communicate with people it's probably more importent that the people you're communicating with understand the message you want to convey over saying it as efficetly as possible. If we work off this premise then the best way to communicate is to use words that almost everyone will understand thus making your message hopefully easier to understand for the people your communicating with agreed?
Jed,zain ur late we already finished this discussion

Jed,"Yo weebs hmu with a good shonen, I want 0 nuance and no complexity at all just swords, yelling, titties and a way too powerful protagonist"

Jed,maybe you'd like kill la kill ? Although its not shounen
Jed,@Eric Working From Home you should watch GTO(Great Teacher Onizuka)
Jed,"Good brain dead happy shows: nichijou, Konosuba, little witch academia, Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, Shokugeki, Zombieland Saga, tsurezure children"

Jed,I love this emo man
Jed,wow the voices in this game are actually obnoxious
Jed,"these are probably the worst characters, voice-wise"
Jed,or maybe I'm just used to being annoyed at them cause I play both of them
Jed,"Whenever I play ultimate with Ava or with her in the room, she always comments on how annoying Ike is because he makes so many war cry type noises."
Jed,ike's voice is way better than this
Jed,that is true
Jed,^
Jed,i think if I had to listen to those voices for 5 minutes i would blow my brains out
Jed,they're not that bad
Jed,they're like the two worst anime voice archetypes
Jed,true
Jed,extremely squeaky little girl and edgy man child
Jed,@Homies come chill
Jed,there was some debate in the queen's fgc discord over who the edgiest character in the game is between that guy and this dude:
Jed,I agree with Kameron
Jed,And I watched it for like 5 seconds
Jed,@The Rona when u get back
Jed,those are some AWESomE VoicCE ACtTORES

Jed,So it was red eye
Jed,2 hours of sleep over the last 36 hours. Check in isn't till 4 so we are derping around
Jed,"Should we go to universal studios, SeaWorld,  or disneyworld"
Jed,??
Jed,Universal studios is also pretty sick
Jed,They got some nice rides
Jed,Universal is the best of those three options
Jed,"You gotta go to adventure Island though, that's where the better rides are (it's a part of Universal studios)"
Jed,Also it's the one with Hogwarts
Jed,^
Jed,adventure island is really cool
Jed,the main park is more movie focussed while adventure island is more ride focussed
Jed,^
Jed,but I agree its probably the best of the three
Jed,honestly disney is kinda boring and its usually mad crowded
Jed,If you like roller coasters
Jed,Adventure Island has probably one of my favourites
Jed,in the Hulk ride
Jed,That ride is fire as fuck

Jed,I just saw a shiniqua raw drink whipped cream
Jed,I've done it
Jed,it's really good
Jed,?
Jed,eaten raw whipped cream
Jed,What is the difference between that and regular whipped cream?
Jed,it hasnt been cooked
Jed,"I'm pretty sure he either means
a) non-whipped cream that you're supposed to whip, or
b) just straight whipped cream without putting it on anything"
Jed,
Jed,I have done both of these things
Jed,the first was honestly much less exciting than the second
Jed,i think @Trapezoider was referring to whipping cream which is hella gross to drink and is not the same as whipped cream
Jed,whipping cream > raw buttermilk
Jed,especially if you're not expecting the buttermilk
Jed,So
Jed,Did you drink whipping cream
Jed,just a bit
Jed,or just whipped cream by itself
Jed,stop drinking things alone that are supposed to be ingredients in other things
Jed,I have done some terrifying things with whipped cream
Jed,

Jed,
Jed,fuck y'all
Jed,

Jed,I think I'm fine
Jed,Shields got big buffed
Jed,Chrom also got buffed
Jed, nerfed cloud

Jed,that matters a lot
Jed,both
Jed,How do you know?
Jed,plus perfect shielding projectiles got better
Jed,"Zack should be happy, Mewtwo is probably the most buffed character of the patch."
Jed,yeah kinda
Jed,Why do you always get so lucky

Jed,come into voice
Jed,"so yesterday at work I was talking about danganronpa with one of the other interns, and I tell him that I've been taking a bit of a break from danganronpa 3 cause I'm pretty sure at least one of my favourite characters is gonna die and I don't feel like going through that right now, he asks me who my favourite characters are, I tell him my two favourites, and on the second one he literally goes

""Oh I remember when he dies!""

I'm now playing again and man just died."
Jed,i bored
Jed,I'm down to do stuff once I'm through this bit of danganronpa
Jed,that'll probably be at least an hour though
Jed,You favorites always die
Jed,"yes, they sure do"
Jed,I still have one left
Jed,and they are extremely suspicious
Jed,This is why you don't tell people who your favorite characters are
Jed,If your favorite doesnt die then you cant pick good characters to favorite
Jed,Sylki that's so bm of that guy what the heck !! So much for a spoiler alert
Jed,yeah kinda
Jed,"it totally is, I'd be mad"
Jed,oh I am
Jed,"but also that whole chunk of the game I played today was really, really good"
Jed,so I'm less upset than I was before just cause it put me in a better mood
Jed,even though one of my favourite characters died
Jed,ooh that's a nice way to look at it
Jed,also I would have been more upset if the character hadn't been raising death flags left and right for 90% of the game
Jed,I just kinda assumed he wasn't gonna make it and honestly I'm shocked he survived this long
Jed,haha just don't get attached to characters like that
Jed,you can't just not get attatched to characters
Jed,danganronpa's good at what it does
Jed,no I'm joking I feel ya
Jed,i should probably play that at some point
Jed,do eeeet

Jed,Be there in a minute
Jed,"@Max 
1) I should just run back instead of shielding all the time, running backwards is really good
2) I need to focus more on not getting hit
3) I think when I am at mid percents I go  for risks thinking I won't die but characters in this game can kill at like 0 so I should stop doing that"
Jed,All solid points
Jed,@Ultimate anyone down?
Jed,I guess I'll play some more
Jed,"I'm down, lemme run to the bathroom first tho"

Jed,and the people i played weren't that great
Jed,my first set I brainlessly approached bowser and got up b'd outta shield for like 5 stocks straight
Jed,once I stopped being dumb it was too late
Jed,then I played a villager
Jed,my palu got 3 stocked cause I dunno what to do vs fair/bair

Jed,thats whats weird
Jed,ok you need loss-of-focus-proof tourney nerves
Jed,try listening to music?

Jed,theres just no friendlies setups at our fests
Jed,so i get cold
Jed,"find something that suits the mood you're looking for - a lot of people go for intense stuff to hype themselves up, I go for more chill stuff to keep myself from getting titled or overly aggressive, it kinda depends what you're looking for"

Jed,we had very few setups today 
Jed,I just gotta grind dude

Jed,I feel your pain Brother
Jed,Just become a teacher
Jed,Factz
Jed,Summer for the rest of your life
Jed,"maybe, but also no"
Jed,
Jed,kids are terrible
Jed,No money lel
Jed,If teaching payed better I totally would do that
Jed,it pays well in canada
Jed,I really enjoy teaching people things
Jed,Maybe in the states you don't make a lot
Jed,I would totally do adjunct professor ship
Jed,"not obscenely well, but pretty damn well"
Jed,Canada is real good
Jed,But getting tenure is hard AF
Jed,you can also teach grade school
Jed,easier to get into
Jed,kind of
Jed,I would want to teach highschool
Jed,cause at least in toronto the teacher's union is a mess
Jed,Fuck elementary
Jed,I remember I once wanted to teach english
Jed,and then I started editing people's essays
Jed,Gg
Jed,and I realized I could not look at high school-level essays for the rest of my life
Jed,I also realized that basically no one cares about english in high school
Jed,Gotta hit up that math / science
Jed,I've peer proofed some of my friends work before and holy hell some people don't know how to write/spell
Jed,"we got to choose from a huge number of damn good books to read and do a few essays on, including Oryx & Crake and Watchmen, I think other than a few people who read Watchmen because comic book I was the only person in the class who actually read the book"
Jed,which our teacher was well aware of and kinda roasted people for which was funny
Jed,but they can't actually do anything about it
Jed,and I think as a teacher I wouldn't take that very well
Jed,"In my English class, we have to do peer review for every essay and after peer reviewing 6 essays I can agree that most people don't know how to write. What amazes me is when people don't even properly follow the assignment instructions."
Jed,yup
Jed,most people consider english a filler course and don't bother putting in anything more than the minimal required effort
Jed,What's funny is how much they are gonna get fucked for that poor skill
Jed,More than math I have to write so many proposals and emails
Jed,Well I try to get an A in everything. Both because it makes getting in to the school you want more likely and I'm just a tryhard at everything by nature.
Jed,Not being able to take control of the written word is such a burden
Jed,2 years into college and I still have a 4.0 
Jed,I've ended up being saddled with handling like all the writing for all the interns at my office
Jed,As long as I get above a b I don't really care but when it comes to my job I'm a tryhard
Jed,I don't even understand half the stuff I'm doing write ups for
Jed,"That is with a math every year, 2 Biology courses, and 1 chemistry course."
Jed,If only jobs check GPA
Jed,he's going for actual college tho
Jed,which sure as hell check gpa
Jed,"I also am going to try for a scholarship to save my parents $25,000"
Jed,that too
Jed,man US college is pricy
Jed,FactZ
Jed,that's almost as much as my 4-year degree plus four years of housing (including the very pricy year in residence with a meal plan)
Jed,Yaw bruh
Jed,actually since it's in USD it's probably more
Jed,Im lucky I got 2 years free
Jed,My community college is like $900 as semester though so that's pretty cheap
Jed,yeah but it's community college so you kinda get what you pay for
Jed,"Professors are a mixed bag. I've had some great ones and some terrible ones. Student body is what you would expect from the price, most people seem far below my social class."
Jed,Lmao imagine having your parents paying for your college
Jed,They planned on doing it so why would I complain?
Jed,technically my grandpa's basically paying for my education cause he left a ton of money for it in his will but he's still alive so he's just kinda paying most of it now anyway -_-
Jed,I'm not planning on going to a 4 year school anymore
Jed,also most people can't afford to put themselves through college on a part-time job
Jed,especially not in the US
Jed,"What are your plans, Jed?"
Jed,Too fucking expensive even with a bunch of scholarships
Jed,"Prolly community college, I'm not sure if I'm gonna stay at home or move somewhere"
Jed,just come to canada for school
Jed,although we do charge extra for foreign students so it's probably not much cheaper
Jed,I might try and learn a trade or something not totally sure yet
Jed,I could have a job with John deer in Montana if I wanted to move out there
Jed,ok I just checked and international students pay like triple the domestic tuition
Jed,maybe don't come to canada for uni
Jed,at least at queen's
Jed,"it's like:
one year of eng degree, domestic: 7k
one year of eng degree, international: 23k"
Jed,That's about as much as my future school I think
Jed,the domestic or the international?
Jed,Yeah that's about the same as gcu before scholarship
Jed,International
Jed,^
Jed,oof
Jed,Gcu was gonna end up being 11k a year
Jed,Too many people go to college anyway
Jed,"that's eng tho, which is one of the pricier ones"
Jed,I think that only smart people who care about learning should go
Jed,"If you are just going to go, get C's, and skip class a lot why bother?"
Jed,C's get degrees
Jed,"cause the degree makes it easier to get a job, and as the saying goes, ""C's get degrees"""
Jed,dammit chris
Jed,you beat me
Jed,Maybe post-acceptance they do
Jed,For me I still need the A
Jed,What do you call the guy who got a C in medical school?
Jed,A doctor
Jed,Doctors
Jed,Exactly
Jed,Why get an A when I can get B's and C's and earn money while going
Jed,Being in Machine learning means I have to keep up on scientific papers and research constantly
Jed,My education doesn't end in college
Jed,I was mainly saying I wish college was less essential for life so it could be an option for smart people to specialize in a technical field.
Jed,I mean it's not gonna matter in 30 years
Jed,None of us are likely to be better than computers at anything
Jed,Good luck getting a science job on a high school degree
Jed,max that's what non-undergrad degrees are for
Jed,I know
Jed,College is still a minority pursuit
Jed,The average person doesn't attain higher education

Jed,Big protein
Jed,Large aminos
Jed,I hope you all are doing well
Jed,:-)
Jed,Today is kind of a work mess
Jed,"At like 5 my manager gives me a task, passes me over to another guy to get more details. From the details I realize any solution like what he wants is gonna be extremely gross code. I do a bit of experimenting and realize there is no way to do it without rewriting a huge portion of the backend, so I ask both the guy who explained what I should do and my manager for clarification. Both had since left the office and gone offline on slack. In desperation, I reach out to the other guy who knows about the bit I'm working on (who is literally on his way to the airport) to ask for help, he suggests a less awful solution, I go ""great, but I don't have access to that code, can you give me access?""  That was fifteen minutes ago. He is presumably busy doing real life things and will not be getting back to me. This was implied to be a somewhat urgent task."
Jed,-- Tldr -- I'm kinda fucked because I got an urgent convoluted task and i don't have access to the code and everyone who might be able to help is gone
Jed,Pinned a message.
Jed,Oops
Jed,Damn discord mobile why do you put pin and edit right next to each other

Jed,Feelsbadman
Jed,also marss and nairo fight again
Jed,zss ditto in top 6 monkaW
Jed,every tournament
Jed,yea
Jed,marss loss to mkleo was very sad bois
Jed,joker is p good
Jed,Is the stream lagging a bit for you guys?
Jed,not really
Jed,nairo what
Jed,you just won with wolf
Jed,what are you doing
Jed,wat
Jed,WHAT IS GOING ON?????!?!?!?
Jed,nairo how did that just work
Jed,this is gonna be a wack vod
Jed,"Marss (ZSS) vs Nairo (ZSS, Wolf, Robin)"
Jed,HOLD THE FUCK UP
Jed,HE WENT DARK PIT
Jed,RANDOM SMASHER
Jed,how does he look so serious
Jed,MARSS IS LOSING STILL??
Jed,my best guess is he's feeling like mars figures out his characters later in the game but he's winning cause he gets an early lead so he's just swapping every game?
Jed,but like wtf nairo
Jed,you go down 0-2
Jed,fucking
Jed,500 iq
Jed,"switch to wolf, win"
Jed,"switch to robin, win"
Jed,switch to dark pit for game 5
Jed,NO WAY
Jed,lol
Jed,what was that
Jed,aight marss figured it out at the end
Jed,but honestly whaaaaat
Jed,Pit is so bad
Jed,alright marss is my favorite player but.......
Jed,he still almost got it tho
Jed,NAIRO IS INSANE
Jed,like that was still really close
Jed,this tourney is mega hype
Jed,salem beating dabuz with shulk
Jed,real question tho
Jed,like
Jed,why no palu
Jed,mkleo's sick joker
Jed,marss is very up vs nairo's palu
Jed,tweek vs mkleo winners finals
Jed,hot damn this man's joker is nuts
Jed,mkleo is crazy
Jed,I'm loving the fast fall upair regrab shenanagins
Jed,well i guess this tourney isn't hype anymore
Jed,mkleo's pretty nuts I dunno
Jed,mkleo just gonna stomp peeps
Jed,tension = 0
Jed,true
Jed,unless somehow marss gets into grands
Jed,but it's still hella nice
Jed,i dont think anyone else can beat leo
Jed,samsora always loses to leo and tweek just got bodied
Jed,I feel like tweek could try some other characters and he might have a chance
Jed,dunno how matchups gonna work
Jed,
Jed,loving these town and city games
Jed,
Jed,stage variety 4head
Jed,lets just remove all the interesting and distinct stages
Jed,ike pog
Jed,I'm focusing so hard on this match
Jed,Have to study both sides
Jed,the best players of max's two characters
Jed,except leo i guess
Jed,they're actually both playing super well
Jed,this is a great set
Jed,I'm better at down throw follow ups then mars lol
Jed,He missed some easy ones
Jed,"roy might be a wacky weight for it, I'm not sure"
Jed,he's a weird weight for a lot of things
Jed,tweek is getting demolished
Jed,That was brutal
Jed,if only marss beat tweek so that this set could have been close
Jed,nvm
Jed,im loving the dynamic between the top players in ultimate

Jed,@everyone  it's Saturday. Let's game
Jed,Which Boss?
Jed,JP
Jed,I assumed so
Jed,What a cool that man is
Jed,Like he was saying “yeah the new Spider-Man trailer basically spoils endgame” and I said “well yeah I guess it doesn’t feature tony in it” and he flips his lid on me saying how he hasn’t seen endgame yet
Jed,Bruh
Jed,:-(
Jed,Wait if that was the whole conversation then he totally in the wrong
Jed,If he's seen the trailer he knows what happens to Tony
Jed,I can't believe that film came out two months ago

Jed,@Homies How is website? http://pathtoneuralink.com/
Jed,Pretty sure this is an error
Jed,
Jed,????
Jed,THAT IS STRANG
Jed,I am seeing that too
Jed,
Jed,@Zain
Jed,What is causing this
Jed,is it the '
Jed,it happened on the bottom too
Jed,that is so weird
Jed,Its wherever I use apostrophe or quotes
Jed,Hmm
Jed,Let me bugfix
Jed,I've seen this before on my poorly designed home school website. I'm not sure how to fix it but I'm pretty sure that its replacing non-letter characters like ' with stuff.
Jed,Looks like I have to use the unicode character for apostrophe's and quotes
Jed,@Sak von Sak Is that my problem?
Jed,it shouldn't be a problem but it depends how you've put together the non-html parts of the website maybe
Jed,it can't hurt to unicode it
Jed,I have no backend
Jed,Its all shiny sauce
Jed,is your front end just raw html & css?
Jed,Yes
Jed,weird
Jed,Bootstrap for the navbar and footer
Jed,Font awesome
Jed,Simple stuff
Jed,"something weird is going on with the formatting, I'm looking at it in chrome dev tools and there's a lot of weirdness"
Jed,No don't roast my code
Jed,does this happen locally?
Jed,
Jed,no like the way chrome is interpreting it is weird
Jed,What am I looking for?
Jed,"just, if you test this code not in the site does it have the same problem?"
Jed,no
Jed,Well
Jed,I don't know now
Jed,Because I unicoded everything
Jed,it might be something weird with whoever's hosting it
Jed,Dreamhost
Jed,They are freaky
Jed,but also I don't know why you have quotes in your <p> tags
Jed,it shouldn't be necessary
Jed,uhh
Jed,I dont
Jed,That is weird
Jed,Wait
Jed,"<p """">"
Jed,"or <p>

STUFF
""""

</p>"
Jed,the second
Jed,oh
Jed,"<p>
""
stuff
""
</p>"
Jed,"should just be
<p>stuff</p>"
Jed,I wrote all the P tag content in a word document and probably put unecessary quotes
Jed,Any other tips for formatting stuff?
Jed,I can't tell for sure cause what I'm seeing isn't your actual code
Jed,just how chrome is parsing it
Jed,Problem has been resolved
Jed,Thanks unicode
Jed,it's still weird that it was happening in the first place
Jed,Yeah I looked in my code
Jed,I didn't put quotes inside my p tags
Jed,Chrome is weird
Jed,or dreamhost has HIV
Jed,probably dreamhost

Jed,Just Google the we schedule
Jed,Why would they do it at 9et
Jed,"That's 6pst, which is where e3 is"
Jed,Jesus Christ that was a stressful game
Jed,That last quarter was crazy
Jed,Did your team win?
Jed,Nope
Jed,losty by 1
Jed,It was
Jed,rip
Jed,106-105
Jed,wow close
Jed,The raptors missed 9 points in the last minute
Jed,Then the last shot of the game that could have one it
Jed,Was nowhere near the basket
Jed,Literally hit it off the backboard
Jed,Why don't they just split the game into 5 quarters instead of 4 and play best of 5 quarters. That would make more of the game feel impactful.
Jed,Too bad these sports are too established to ever make a common sense change like this.
Jed,i was tryna trade with some guy in PoE but he was speaking korean so i got my korean speaking friend to help me

Jed,Boys
Jed,I finally
Jed,Got
Jed,a god damn
Jed,shift
Jed,we all said yes
Jed,@Homies Road Trip! we getting the whole gang together to go fight @Zain
Jed,What a great idea to spend time with the boys
Jed,And fuck @Zain
Jed,what did he do
Jed,"We start with picking up me then we cross the border to get kameron then we cross the border to pick up schlef then we cross the border to get jed and andrew then we cross the border to get chris then we cross the border to get smithy and karina then we cross the border to get zack then we cross the border to get max and ava then we cross the border to fight fusion then we cross the border to go to LAX to all fly home, we're leaving hte car there"
Jed,That is the worst route lol
Jed,it is optimal for border crossing
Jed,What do you mean?
Jed,Why are we doing this
Jed,Can you come up with a better one?
Jed,Also come get me
Jed,Me and chris are basically next to each other
Jed,because zain is a raidboss so we need to get the entire party together to combine our strength
Jed,maybe they want a long road trip for fun uwu
Jed,okay because zack complained i have cleaned up the route
Jed,Yes that's much more sane
Jed,okay but why in the first place
Jed,why are we fighting zain
Jed,i need to throw hands with zain
Jed,he knows what he's done
Jed,and i need my team to back me up
Jed,
Jed,It's only like 3.5 days of continuous driving
Jed,So practically about a week
Jed,i prefer the 2 weeks of continuous route
Jed,oh then we gotta get back
Jed,so double it
Jed,What happened to ditching the car at LAX?
Jed,witht he optimal route we dont do that
Jed,Ah
Jed,So it's time & distance efficient but not cost because we lose the cost of the car
Jed,Probably a van actually
Jed,We are taking Mike's 5 seater
Jed,Its gotta fit like ten of us tho
Jed,we will strap yall to the top
Jed,
Jed,Are we doing this?
Jed,I am so down
Jed,I'll help pay for gas 
Jed,
Jed,Guys can we please do this
Jed,even distribution its about $500 a person
Jed,Uhh
Jed,uh
Jed,
Jed,4200 miles / 300 miles per tank = 14 fillups
Jed,we but we renting an rv
Jed,to fit everyone
Jed,14 fill ups x 12 gallons  per gillup = 196 gallons
Jed,4 dollars per gallon x 196 gallons = $784
Jed,/ 7people = $74 per person
Jed,How much is an RV rental?
Jed,yeah but we renting an rv so at 100 a night figure 3 weeks thats 2100 plus its not as fuel efficient as your estimate
Jed,all these numbers are calculated with the route where we ping pong across hte country and go over hte border 9 times btw
Jed,Lol No!!!
Jed,XD
Jed,Don't use that route
Jed,Take the optimal one
Jed,nah
Jed,What's even the point if we don't use the non-optimal route
Jed,I CANNOT AFFORD THE SUB OPTIMAL ROUTE
Jed,sub optimal route or we walk
Jed,Bet
Jed,I have my army of fiends ready to go bring it mother fuckers @Homies

The reason for this will become apparent once it begins. For now, all you need to do to help me prepare for this event is to post the names of things you like (probably around 5-10 things would be the best number) in the submissions channel. You can post anything, from something as vague as ""history"" to as specific as ""pizza""."
Jed,@The Rona I'm down for OoT randomizer

Jed,
Jed,
Jed,@Meetup Created a role for @ing meetup related people. I gave this role to everyone who will possibly be there. The official days for the meetup were decided yesterday as July 19th (Friday) to July 29th (Monday). The airport Chris's dad would like people to fly in to is Toronto Pearson (YYZ). If anyone has a problem with these days please let us know soon so we can possibly make slight adjustments before I buy my plane tickets.
Jed,is it okay if i fly into Hamilton Regional (HAM)?
Jed,You literally live there dude
Jed,You can but you would have to walk over
Jed,F
Jed,ac work
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,Fighting Game Controller Tier List
Jed,I almost agree with this
Jed,"But I would at least put the power glove up to A, maybe even S"
Jed,maybe swap the power glove and the vive?
Jed,Due to how easy it is to control
Jed,N a h
Jed,just
Jed,bump the glove to A tier
Jed,Yeah
Jed,Like top of A
Jed,
Jed,Ok looks good now
Jed,I would reverse this and move the wii remote and it would be perfect
Jed,you really think fighting your opponent IRL should be 2nd bottom tier?
Jed,tbh I had no idea what that picture meant
Jed,it means clocking your opoonent in the jaw so you are the only remaining fighter
Jed,honestly that strat is pretty foolproof
Jed,and its a controller cause you control who actually is able to play
Jed,s tier free
Jed,Yeah but the one drawback it has is that it only works during lan
Jed,Because of that I think it deserves the A spot
Jed,Mmmmm you could just swat them
Jed,Would that count as it's own thing though?
Jed,Or an extension of fighting them
Jed,I would
Jed,i would
Jed,"@Meetup Tickets purchased! People Currently confirmed: Max, Chris, Zack, Benson, Devon. Pending: Andrew, Kameron, Jed. Definite NO: Zain, Smithy, Ava. Toronto Frostbite meetup 2019 is looking to be very good."
Jed,Anyone in need of a passport should take care of that as soon as possible
Jed,
Jed,Excited
Jed,take me off hte list
Jed,i aint going
Jed,oh okay
Jed,im starting my own meetup
Jed,
Jed,with blackjack and hookers
Jed,you know what
Jed,forget hte hookers
Jed,ill be in devon's pool
Jed,the meetup is exclusively in my pool
Jed,once you enter
Jed,you cannot leave
Jed,put me down as a definite yes for dober's sick pool meetup
Jed,
Jed,Aw hell yeah
Jed,
Jed,How are you going to play Blackjack in the pool though
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,already got it covered
Jed,Fuck
Jed, flight would only be $500
Jed,And passport is like 100 I think
Jed,@Max what other things would I need to account for costwise
Jed,uhhhh
Jed,It'll probably depend on if I can take a week off work
Jed,We are staying at Chris's house
Jed,Food/activities?
Jed,I'm not really sure how much of that we need to buy
Jed,Chris should tell us how much his planned activities cost
Jed,@Jed Want the meetup role for regular updates and access to the meetup planning channel?
Jed,Yee
Jed,I'ma try and make this work
Jed,Work will be my only problem I think
Jed,I'll go and revise my earlier message
Jed,@Mr. Airplane if I end up going to the Meetup and you don't I'll fly to Maryland and tell you that I'm disappointed in you
Jed,Oh shit
Jed,Jed coming now too hopefully
Jed,
Jed,I have the money it's all about my work
Jed,Try to book it off right now
Jed,Cause I just started last week and I'm already taking a week vacation this week
Jed,oh
Jed,You can do it
Jed,I believe
Jed,Sending positive vibes in your direction
Jed,I'm not a super essential part of the farm yet like I'm just an extra pair of hands
Jed,So hopefully 
Jed,farm?
Jed,And honestly this Meetup is probably more important to me than this job
Jed,Yeah I work on a farm now
Jed,what kind of farm
Jed,like whats growing
Jed,the devil's lettuce
Jed,
Jed,Yeah we grow hemp
Jed,But it's also a dairy and other crops
Jed,oh shit dawg
Jed,Literally every farm in Oregon is growing hemp cause it's the only place you can
Jed,Also there's a chance I'll be able to get a day or two off during the meetup bit I'll have to ask pretty far in advance so if we could figure out which days would be best ahead of time thatd be good
Jed,The meetup has been decided as July 19th to 29th
Jed,@Max cs?
Jed,^
Jed,Sure be there soon
Jed,@Sak von Sak We should probably be able to work around whichever days are easiest for you
Jed,They'll all be about equal except some Wednesdays and Thursdays
Jed,@Cs:go
Jed,@Max join up dork
Jed,I meant more for events that I normally wouldn't be able to join cause they'd be during work
Jed,
Jed,Joined the server.
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL
Jed,@The Rona that's your house right
Jed,Yeah
Jed,I might be fucked passport wise
Jed,Just get it now
Jed,
Jed,It can take like 2 months to get though
Jed,I think there should be an Express option.
Jed,I have a valid passport card
Jed,So idk if I just need to renew and get a book or apply for a new one
Jed,NO passyport here :/
Jed,Largeable Sad
Jed,I will not be procuring meetup attendature REEEEEEEEE

Jed,I'm down
Jed,@Max  ❓
Jed,chris when down?
Jed,cause i ain't staying up late anymore
Jed,don't think I want to
Jed,why not 
Jed,The amount of time required to be good enough at a game to have fulfilling speedruns of it is time I would rather spend doing other things.
Jed,i dunno about that tho
Jed,i feel like once you pin down the necessary tech runs should be pretty fulfilling
Jed,I ain't staying up late anymore either

Jed,If its government issued it should be fine
Jed,Otherwise a passport still works
Jed,https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification
Jed,Identification
Jed,Adult passengers 18 and over must show valid identification at the airport checkpoint in order to travel.
Jed,Yeah learners permit maybe not ok but the other stuff on the list is
Jed,Just get your license idiot
Jed,Also I don't think in gonna be able to make it @Max it's a little too last minute
Jed,
Jed,The passport would cost like 250-300 to get on time
Jed,you could also just go without
Jed,it'll take a little longer but iirc they just ask you questions
Jed,also if you were tryna fly to toronto i thought you needed ur passport anyways
Jed,Yeah but I only have a passport card

Jed,"For those who didn't know, Ally (28) has been exposed for being in a gay relationship with Captain Zack (a MINOR) and has now retired from smash. Let him never return and hopefully go to jail."
Jed,"Uuuh you're missing some important parts, cause I'm pretty sure it was technically legal age-wise (just extremely, extremely sketchy), the real issues from what Ive heard of the situation involved physical and sexual assault"
Jed,"So yes, hopefully he ends up in jail"
Jed,But hey at least this isn't like the Nightmare situation where it was technically legal and he had tons of people on his side
Jed,But he'd basically forced a 16 year old to date and sleep his 24-year-old self
Jed,At least people are pretty universally against ally
Jed,(Also tbh it's weird to me that you focused on the gay part rather than most of the actual problems)
Jed,(Most people already knew that they're both gay)
Jed,"Aight I looked into it a bit more and apparently the assault stuff was exaggerations and theorizing, so that's less bad at least"
Jed,Still creepy borderline pedophilia and I'm glad its come out and that ally is retiring
Jed,But he's not gonna end up in jail cause it was technically legal
Jed,Max doesnt care if it was legal
Jed,pride month is over
Jed,     
Jed,that makes me sad. ally was such a good player
Jed,"I wouldn't say I focused on the gay part at all, I just mentioned it for those who might be unaware. I literally capitalized the word minor to avoid this problem and show the area I was emphasizing. But I guess people would read it that way anyway because its me. Just to clarify, no, I do not think gay people should go to jail. I was referring to the fact that he was dating an underaged person."
Jed,yeha i agree with max there it didnt really seem like he focused on it more like an offhand comment
Jed,"I mean a) you started with gay, which is usually an emphasis thing, and b) it has no bearing on it being problematic and the phrasing makes it sound like you're giving it roughly even billing with everything else. I get that it wasnt intentional but also given your general opinions it doesn't necessarily come across as such."
Jed,"Well, sorry if you took it the wrong way. Maybe I should have left out that detail entirely given my history."
Jed,Also there's a bit of an issue with people who do equate homosexuality and pedophilia so its definitely somewhere to watch your phrasing for potential misinterpretation
Jed,"I definitely see a difference considering one is consensual and I only object for religious reasons, which you may not agree with but I hope you at least understand. While the other is taking advantage of a difference in intelligence and being a predator."
Jed,"Was basically making sure there wasnt a misunderstanding, and also at the time I thought there had also been assault which I thought was more important to mention"
Jed,gamers rise up and join vc im lonely
Jed,In short: poor communication kills and we both didn't do a great job

Jed,Isn't that the guy Zain always mentions?
Jed,Yes
Jed,his whole brand is debating dumb people
Jed,which as a concept is already pretty trashy
Jed,Mob Psycho 100 season 1 finished. Totally not for me but I get why its popular. 6/10
Jed,@Mr. Airplane many people today believe in some pretty crazy ass shit he does debate these crazy people. If he or other people like him waren’t to do this they could and would push there agenda and make more “crazy” people and so thats why its good that he can will and has debated these crazy people. On the topic of likeabilty this is entirly subjective so if you don’t like hin alright cool i guess.
Jed,wow dude i didn't realize that destiny was so heroic
Jed,truly the savior of our generation
Jed,"hi man i'm just addressing the points you brought up. i wake up and i see my lord and savior destiny chan being insulted can't believe this, but in all seriousness he's not a nice person to any extent but the reasoning you brought up for not likeing him is pretty week"
Jed,@Mr. Airplane i dont think destiny is the least likable person on the internet I'd have to say its def @The Rona. Destiny is a close second tho

Jed,the question was what book does moses lead the jews out of egypt
Jed,The old testament or the Torah as the Jews call it.
Jed,the asnwer was exodus
Jed,Oh you meant like that
Jed,I thought you meant more generally
Jed,wouldn't that make the bible the bible part 2
Jed,and the book of mormon the bible part 3
Jed,That would be the case if a Jew is the one answering
Jed,It is a matter of perspective

Jed,NEURALINK UPDATE [OFFICIAL]
Jed,"This is not a Path To Neuralink episode. This is my take on an official announcement from Neuralink. At around 6:50pm 7/10/2019, Neuralink announced via Twit..."
Jed,Alright question time
Jed,Is it rude to make a phone call on a bus
Jed,Not is it allowable but is it impolite
Jed,It depends on how loud you are being
Jed,Like if you are asking everyone on the bus to quiet down so you can hear
Jed,That's rude as hell
Jed,But if you've got earbuds in or something
Jed,You good
Jed,???
Jed,How do earbuds change anything
Jed,I don't know how to explain that any other way
Jed,Also obviously emergencies are exempt
Jed,I think talking on the phone on a bus is obviously rude
Jed,People just don't understand the concept of public spaces
Jed,What's the difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you?
Jed,I don't think that talking to someone next to you on the bus is polite either
Jed,But...
Jed,I mean
Jed,Just don't be loud
Jed,One could argue that talking on the phone is more avoidable
Jed,I mean for you to be heard in a bus or metro you gotta talk kinda loud
Jed,This is why earbuds are effective
Jed,You should be able to hear them without problem
Jed,And you don't have to talk as loud if you speak directly into the microphone of the earbuds
Jed,"I feel like if you try to keep the conversation to a minimum we good, but if you're voluntarily entering a conversation that's pretty rude"
Jed,It's a matter of respecting public space
Jed,I guess
Jed,Ok both of you are wrong how is talking to the person next to you rude and how is talking on your phone rude and obviously I'm talking about at a respectable volume
Jed,if you think talking on the bus is rude ur a bitchass
Jed,Dude that's literally my argument at the beginning
Jed,Just keep it at a respectable volume
Jed,if someone on a bus talks so loud to the point of a problem someone will tell them to shut up
Jed,Bro if you guys don't understand the significance of the discussion you're so obviously part of the problem
Jed,My argument is that people fail to respect public spaces
Jed,our argument is that the discussion has no significance
Jed,Yes if you just circumvent the entirety of my argument obviously I appear to be wrong
Jed,if youre bothered by people talking in a public space then you have the problem not the speaker
Jed,public spacws arent inheritly silent
Jed,Respect public spaces people can still talk to each other and respect the people around them
Jed,I agree with boi Greg
Jed,yes zain that's true but again that's not really my point
Jed,also greg
Jed,'s argument is actually braindead
Jed,YOU CAN'T CHOOSE TO BE IN A PUBLIC SPACE OR NOT ITS NOT YOUR FAULT IF ITS UNCOMFORTABLE
Jed,???
Jed,that actually makes zero sense to me
Jed,BRO IF YOU DONT LIKE  RACISM JUST MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE
Jed,4HEAD
Jed,
Jed,I gotta say this is a mess
Jed,thats not a good comparison tho
Jed,racism is a real issue people talking on a bus is a mild annoyance at best
Jed,I don't see how talking in a public space is a problem
Jed,i mean the conversation was fine until these two bozos just lack the understanding of what's being discussed entirely
Jed,ok does people talking in class bother you
Jed,what about a library
Jed,not really
Jed,If I'm riding the bus with a friend are we both supposed to just sit there in silence?
Jed,Kameron
Jed,^
Jed,also just because it may not bother you it can bother others
Jed,Wait stop those are completely different spaces
Jed,That's what I said
Jed,Those are terrible examples
Jed,that too
Jed,Both with existing expectations of quietness
Jed,A bus is not a silent space
Jed,Those comparison are so bad'
Jed,ok but there aren't many other public spaces
Jed,the park
Jed,Cause in a class you're supposed to listen to a teacher
Jed,the street
Jed,"its not a matter of does it bother me, its about respecting the wishes of others"
Jed,And all libraries have rules against it
Jed,In a public space that has no predetermined rules of being quiet
Jed,But how do you know it bothers them
Jed,u can talk as you like
Jed,the street does not fit into the way we are using 'public space' here
Jed,This clearly something you think
Jed,BUSES ALSO HAVE RULES AGAINST TALKING ON THE BUS YOU MORONS
Jed,???
Jed,they literally do
Jed,Not the buses I'm on
Jed,Likewise
Jed,if you really are causing serious trouble for someone then they have to notify you to stop or just deal w it
Jed,Also ive never heard of a bus with talking eules
Jed,its not a matter of serious trouble its a matter of respect
Jed,Kameron I want your source
Jed,What the fuck kind of buses do they have where you live???
Jed,its not a rule as in if you break it you're removed
Jed,Respect towards who
Jed,i can confirm busses here have no such rules
Jed,but a lot of busses have signs that say to keep noise to a minimum
Jed,bro where
Jed,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/bus-commuters-hold-all-calls-or-else/
Jed,"Bus Commuters Hold All Calls, or Else"
Jed,"On some New Jersey commuter buses, cellphone use is banned. But some passengers defy the rules and make business and personal calls, which leads to confrontations with drivers and other riders who demand quiet."
Jed,"Yeah there's a difference between a conversation and what they're talking about, which is stuff like yelling or blasting music"
Jed,Ok that's wack
Jed,Thats siper weird lmao
Jed,2008
Jed,why new jersey gonna have some rule like that when like
Jed,And I've never seen anything like that anywhere I've been
Jed,proper cities with populated transport dont
Jed,That's interesting by that I mean retarded
Jed,There's literally no difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you
Jed,Again
Jed,Just keep it respectable
Jed,yes chris I agree
Jed,Also this article is from 2008
Jed,ok ill admit its the first thing i found
Jed,but you guys were like: 'this doesn't exist'
Jed,it definitely exists
Jed,but you probably have not looked for it
Jed,well everything probably exists but a exception does not make the rule
Jed,this is the same argument as sniffling during a test
Jed,it simply demostrates a lack of understanding that your actions may impact others around you
Jed,Sniffling is uncontrollable tho its totally not
Jed,false
Jed,you can
Jed,Wait what
Jed,bring a tissue
Jed,wipe your nose on your shirt
Jed,Sniffing is deffinitly controllable
Jed,Just wipe your nose
Jed,ask to go to the bathroom
Jed,if a tissue isnt provided or if you forget then what
Jed,wipe your nose on your shirt
Jed,thats actually nasty
Jed,imagine getting upset at people sniffling
Jed,
Jed,Mike
Jed,"Shut up, whore"
Jed,
Jed,so mad
Jed,realize that you are sick and then should bring a tissue for your test
Jed,Just dont be sick
Jed,
Jed,plus a test still has an expectation of quiet so sniffling is still.more severe than talking on a bus
Jed,its not a matter of severity my guy
Jed,A bus has no expectation of quiet
Jed,ok that's just raw false
Jed,so there is no reason to assume people want quiet
Jed,if someone wants quiet then its their job to ask for it
Jed,if someone played their music on the bus without earbuds would people be annoyed
Jed,NO ITS NOT
Jed,in a library its different
Jed,you shouldn't have to ask others to be respectful
Jed,if someone plays music such that its annoying then just tell them to stop
Jed,yes but that doesn't mean its rude in the first place
Jed,Its not disrespectful to not assume people want quiet
Jed,*not rude
Jed,Greg is totally wrong here
Jed,^
Jed,You just shouldn't blast music out of your phone on the bus
Jed,well no you shouldnt
Jed,Nobody wants to hear that shit except for you
Jed,because loud music is always annoying
Jed,It is though
Jed,"but talking on a bus isnt usually annoying, especially at a reasonable volume"
Jed,yes we all agree
Jed,If it doesnt cause problems in general then why is it suddenly disrepectful
Jed,that makes 0 sense
Jed,because using the condition reasonable volume inherently means that what you are doing isn't disrespectful
Jed,"again, your example is unrelated to the argument"
Jed,If you want silence in a place that does not demand silence then its not everone elses job to know you want solence
Jed,??????
Jed,Ur arguement is also totally related
Jed,im actually done discussing this with someone who clearly doesn't even understand the issue
Jed,breakfast time
Jed,You cant just say theres an issue and assume i will accept that
Jed,you have to establish the problem first
Jed,he said no and left
Jed,bruh i told you its breakfast time
Jed,i already said why its a problem
Jed,I dont assume everyone is going to be quiet unless its a place like a library
Jed,I dont think its rude for people to play music in public
Jed,Kameron your argument is actually retarded. People pointed out a valid flaw and you moved the fucking goal post
Jed,@Homies game time
Jed,@The Rona 
Jed,Certified gamer moment
Jed,@Trapezoider i see what you mean and ur probably right i think how i phrased the initial question was not what we ended up discussing tbh
Jed,but yeah my initial take was overly spice
Jed,im gay
Jed,yikes
Jed,thats pretty gay
Jed,also chris apparently investigations have a better chance of the odogaron gen
Jed,I already got the gem
Jed,Also Gavin was the one who typed that message
Jed,sure pal
Jed,sure pal
Jed,sure pal
Jed,sure pal
Jed,sure pal
Jed,I want to die

Jed,watch out for the warn
Jed,@Homies gamer time

Jed,I actually expected a mini poop war
Jed,Love you bro no homo
Jed,
Jed,I team defense fort 2 at 7:30pm
Jed,Attack on Titan Season 3 is actually amazing and one of the best shows I've ever seen
Jed,Highly recommend
Jed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UH_ys1jnDg
Jed,Money joon
Jed,@Max agreed I finished it like two weeks ago
Jed,h e c k  y e s
Jed,1000000/10
Jed,Rise up gamers
Jed,Shows fucking excellent
Jed,Can't wait for season 4
Jed,
Jed,Its labeled as the final season if you were not aware
Jed,No
Jed,Not facts
Jed,I looked into this
Jed,
Jed,Straight from myanimelist
Jed,https://www.google.com/amp/s/screenrant.com/attack-titan-season-3-game-thrones-mistakes/amp/
Jed,Attack On Titan Is Making The Same Mistake As Game Of Thrones
Jed,"Game of Thrones rushed its ending, now Attack on Titan is doing the same."
Jed,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1148984/Attack-on-titan-season-4-release-date-cast-trailer-plot-when-is-attack-on-titan-out/amp&ved=2ahUKEwjN6YPQhK7jAhVGIDQIHUifCbEQFjALegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw0J1Soh4WbfKnbZkWHLrajo&ampcf=1

Jed,You are wrong
Jed,There's still like 50 chapters of manga
Jed,
Jed,I don't think that matters
Jed,This season could be long
Jed,also manga chapters are short
Jed,MAL only posts verifiable information
Jed,like most manga I've read where I've also seen the show it's usually like 2-5 chapters per episode
Jed,(5 is usually for fights where the action that takes up a lot of panels takes not a lot of screen time)
Jed,Wow so that wouldn't even be a full 12 episodes at 5 per episode
Jed,(it's usually closer to 2-3)
Jed,@Ultimate ultimate?
Jed,Max season 3 part 2 is over
Jed,I know that
Jed,The show has another season coming
Jed,Next summer
Jed,Yes that is what I was saying
Jed,Omg
Jed,4head
Jed,Also its October
Jed,WHAT
Jed,no tis july
Jed,its october
Jed,YO THATS WAY SOO ER
Jed,@Feral Nebula FACTZ?
Jed,yes
Jed,NEXT October
Jed,^
Jed,at least for now
Jed,2020
Jed,because AOT has a track record of changing plans
Jed,so don't count on it one hundo percent
Jed,They may want to time the manga and anime to end at the same time to maximize sales
Jed,@Max @Sak von Sak ultimate?
Jed,
Jed,Not feeling ultimate right now

Jed,I sure didn't
Jed,@Max @Sak von Sak wanna watch together?
Jed,I made the comeback though so its fine
Jed,last few minutes of D&D then sure
Jed,I'll join after getting some food
Jed,I also discovered a really cool pika edgeguard where you drag down with fair and then footstool. I have no idea if I could repeat it consistently but it was so cool. Gimped a mario at like 60%.
Jed,lol fiction's DI is so bad
Jed,melee looks so much worse without slippy
Jed,
Jed,He is using all the wrong moves
Jed,"Max, you didn't deserve that GSP anyways, Pika is annoying
~ Benson probably"
Jed,Pikachu is so much fun
Jed,i dont hate max that much
Jed,to say shit like that
Jed,I like Pikachu too
Jed,tweek game 5 vs a brawlhalla player monkaW
Jed,Who?
Jed,sandstorm
Jed,Wrenched
Jed,Oh
Jed,
Jed,Who does the brawlhalla guy play?
Jed,he's playing ken
Jed,ken is busted
Jed,Ken seems pretty good
Jed,I've always been a Ken believer
Jed,Ken got buffed
Jed,He used to be terrible
Jed,I stand by what I said
Jed,Imagine wearings knee wraps when squatting less than 135
Jed,I don't even know what analogy to give to explain how stupid this guy is
Jed,It's like spending $1000 on a custom GameCube controller for your first tournament
Jed,Smh
Jed,Maybe he has weak knees
Jed,Nonono
Jed,Not those type of knee straps
Jed,I'm talking knee wraps that apply so much force on the lower half of the squat that your legs can do nothing BUT GO UP
Jed,
Jed,Meant for guys to squat 800 lbs
Jed,Very bad for the knees
Jed,
Jed,Maybe he's just weak as fuck
Jed,And needs those to lift
Jed,4head
Jed,That's not how dis work
Jed,@Master Memers TF2
Jed,???

Jed,because twitter sucka da large pp
Jed,Nestle’s children companies
Jed,@Master Memers TEAM FORT LATER
Jed,Yes Sir
Jed,Wizzy just won the smash 64 major
Jed,Zain 4 stocked Hbox
Jed,zain 4-stocked hbox
Jed,woah
Jed,
Jed,If you watch Leffen's restream he is pointing out all the stuff Hbox is messing up. Its actually really funny how much stuff he gets wrong but doesn't get punished for because he is puff.
Jed,hbox bad
Jed,leff man real good
Jed,Hbox's DI is actually so bad
Jed,'dreamland isn't a free win for puff' is such a pepega opinion
Jed,alright puff is the best character in the game im down
Jed,especially in b05
Jed,Welcome to the club
Jed,marth #2
Jed,b05 actually favors puff and marth so hard
Jed,Having a free win is nice
Jed,It sure would be good if we had a ban... 
Jed,it actually makes viewing melee so much less fun
Jed,Ultimate is over an hour late lol
Jed,Puff is so interesting
Jed,I'd never thought id see the day where i was waiting for another smash game bored outta my mind watching melee
Jed,The ruleset needs to be updated to reflect the new meta
Jed,Make Melee Great Again
Jed,"Ban wobbling, ledge grab limit, bans in bo5"
Jed,100%
Jed,At least ultimate nerfed Olimar
Jed,Olimar being not as good makes the game so much better to watch
Jed,ultimate meta is kinda neat
Jed,the problem is that the boring matches in melee are also alot longer than the hype ones are
Jed,Banning puff would make the game more interesting
Jed,so like 3 boring matches in a top 8 takes up half the time
Jed,... or more
Jed,unfrozen stadium 
Jed,Why are they good for bo5?
Jed,"anyone: lands 1-2 hits
toph: THATS BIG DAMAGE"
Jed,Bo5 has no stage ban. Puff and Marth each have a stage they are massively favored on vs most characters.
Jed,I dont like toph
Jed,hbox di lol
Jed,Pepelaugh
Jed,sad
Jed,pillowpet guy pog
Jed,DALLAS LUCKY
Jed,I feel like I'm listening to a conversation of exchange students ^

Jed,twitch chat can probably claim to be a proper dialect at this point
Jed,4 people on commentary is too much
Jed,especially when 3/4 aren't very good
Jed,alright scratch that it's 3 commentators the 3 not good ones
Jed,Twitch English

Jed,@Meetup DAILY  VLOGS 
Jed,is 15 all there is? I don't want a repeat of yesterday
Jed,Yes
Jed,get devon to send the picture at some point before i finish if you guys want it in the video
Jed,So my parents are selling our house
Jed,And the real estate agent came over
Jed,but I didnt know that
Jed,So I walk out of the bathroom
Jed,Oh pog they are moving in with you
Jed,In nothing but my undies
Jed,
Jed,Thats a way to meet someone
Jed,Nah
Jed,They arae moving north
Jed,@Trapezoider you got an apartment already?
Jed,yessir
Jed,when are you moving into it?
Jed,also I'm sorry to disappoint but I just can't do the daily vlog today
Jed,i can throw it together if you want but I seriously can't take anymore of this meme editing right now
Jed,or maybe not even that why is this taking so long to accomplish nothing
Jed,I'm so irritiated
Jed,I don't want to do this anymore
Jed,Don't blame me when there is no vlog today
Jed,
Jed,hey
Jed,don't be mean to me
Jed,you guys are putting pressure on me to spend hours of my day everyday making dumb memes
Jed,it's starting to stress me out
Jed,
Jed,get devon to do it like he originally was
Jed,Devon is here though
Jed,We have no way to edit
Jed,uhghdughudfhgksjdfskldjf
Jed,maybe I'll try again later
Jed,I still need that photo of the bathroom and the video from Benson
Jed,"but probably no more memes tomorrow. Don't expect too much, it really does take a lot of time. (also I might be busy all day the 24th and 25th)"
Jed,okay well this one is done. I'm rendering it rn. I didn't do either of Benson's requests both because the first one took too much editing and the second one bc I never received the clip for it.
Jed,Just to make a statement if you guys really need me to I can continue editing the clips together if for whatever reason none of you can but the fancy editing and memes will be minimal from here on out because this is taking upwards of two and a half hours everyday and it's really draining. glad you guys enjoyed the memes while they lasted though.
Jed,i enjoyed it for the first two days but its just too much im sorry

Jed,how much does fighter pack cost?
Jed,25 dollars yikes
Jed,That's for everyone though
Jed,yeah but i thought that hero only costs 6 dollars
Jed,so it'd be cheaper to buy 4 characters
Jed,and then not buy banjo cause he looks dumb
Jed,
Jed,real talk you'd probably still save money cause most tournaments give you a discount for bringing a setup
Jed,and not having all the characters means they can't use your setup
Jed,Yeah but Kameron dumb
Jed,i dont really want tournies to use my setup cause then i'd have to stay there after going 0-4

Jed,but then the day after i get back i go to new york for a splat lan
Jed,We can play tonight tho
Jed,"Random idea: Settlers of Catan could be made into a more consistent game by replacing the dice with a deck of cards with the numbers 1-12 on them. The deck would have the same number of each number as that number has dots on the board. For example, there would be one card with ""2"" and one card with ""12"" while there would be five cards with ""8"". The deck would be completely drawn through before reshuffling. This would ensure players get the exact return they should on their investments into certain tiles and would eliminate a lot of randomness from the game."
Jed,doesnt that give a totally unfair advantage to the person selecting second
Jed,since the second person geenrally had the best choices overall for picks
Jed,I don't think this change would give an unfair advantage. There will be games where the person who picks good tiles will get an even bigger advantage if they get lucky with rolls and games where they do very poorly because of bad luck. The first scenario is unfun because that person is highly likely to win and the second is unfun because that person is just losing to luck. My rules change would just balance out the outliers and make the game more dependent on skill.
Jed,"Ultimately managing resources based on luck is a type of skill, vs knowing ""oh i have a sheep coming so I dont have to do anything"""
Jed,It also makes player trading worthwhile

Jed,"just sorta show up whenever, Kameron's finishing an OW game"
Jed,"I really dislike the design of the Hero. Random crits, random down B, random move on the down B, instant kill. Whyyyyyyyy"
Jed,@The Rona WOAH I HEARD U WAS TALKING SHIT
Jed,the hero sounds lit
Jed,what are you talking about
Jed,random crits?
Jed,that's my jam
Jed,DansGame
Jed,i love being rewarded for being bad
Jed,"Max, you listed the same point twice"
Jed,@Max
Jed,ima be back in 10
Jed,ima leave in 10
Jed,"@The Rona Those are two different reasons. The down B is inherently random by selecting 4 moves. One of the possible moves to get is a move that does something completely random, even potentially harmful to yourself."
Jed,I forgot about that one
Jed,But also
Jed,Just don't pick that one
Jed,
Jed,Guys I lost my gf and I'm scared
Jed,There's a homeless person yelling next to me
Jed,Hlp
Jed,where are you ??
Jed,Down town Salem
Jed,I seriously don't know where she went. And I have her phone
Jed,uh oh
Jed,downtown salem isn't that big. She couldn't've gone too far

Jed,although ivy got a bit nerfed
Jed,Mewtwo buffs
Jed,
Jed,also the fuck is this
Jed,world's least relevant nerf
Jed,LOL
Jed,Actually useless
Jed,Another patch of my characters not being changed
Jed,Works for me
Jed,What projectiles even do 50% ???0
Jed,Probably items/already reflected projectiles
Jed,I'm just greatful that they didn't destroy him
Jed,it might just be cause it lasts so long that you can double reflect with a single input?
Jed,but that's still... kinda dumb
Jed,Tetracon last long but not that long though
Jed,mebe
Jed,"still, I'm hyped about zard getting buffs to ftilt, fsmash (like it wasn't already hella strong when you hit it??), longer-lasting nair, and a stronger fthrow"
Jed,i can confirm that hero is retarded
Jed,but super fun
Jed,imagine slower robin with killpower
Jed,i think hero is mid high tier
Jed,once people learn the matchup
Jed,joker still best character in game
Jed,watching more gameplay of zero kicking ass
Jed,i no longer think he's mid high tier
Jed,i think he's high high tier

Jed,cakeassault on evo stream for ultimate
Jed,ok i made this cause im bored
Jed,you are underestimating accelerate
Jed,but good tier list
Jed,9/10 would agree
Jed,i also think snooze is A
Jed,accelerate just too fast
Jed,speed is usually good but you simply go too fast for it to be useful
Jed,snooze is mega slow
Jed,and thus more situational
Jed,snooze gives you free kill and you can throw ppl into it
Jed,because its slow
Jed,"also, if you can control accelerate it scary"
Jed,Yeah but Hero's grab sucks ass
Jed,"""if you can"""
Jed,not sure if its really even feasible
Jed,7/10 times i see kameron use snooze it does something stupid
Jed,also i can control it
Jed,That's because it is almost never the correct option to use it
Jed,it's not that hard
Jed,And the times where you do use it
Jed,It was the correct situation to do so
Jed,Conformation bias
Jed,"yea, yea, conformation bias with kameron's tierlist too"
Jed,i mean in all fairness
Jed,the reasoning behind all of the a and s tier spells is that they are consistently very useful in most situations
Jed,except for magic burst which is just ridiculous in certain situations
Jed,I Appreciate my @Homies

Jed,yo boys
Jed,smash is starting soon
Jed,also meetup japan 2020? we goin to evo japan boys
Jed,anyone wana watch top 8 with me?
Jed,boys boys boys boys
Jed,circular television. my new latest idea.
Jed,TV's used to be round
Jed,
Jed,are you saying like miniature imax?
Jed,boys boys boys boys
Jed,spherical television my grand newest idea
Jed,no
Jed,terrible idea
Jed,^
Jed,come watch evo with me
Jed,top 8 starting
Jed,I don't know if I've ever seen a smash tournament do winner's side top 8 before loser's side
Jed,they've been doing it all day
Jed,it is a bit weird but it's an evo thing I guess
Jed,This is the first I've watched of evo
Jed,this year
Jed,Last 2 days were lan night + practice for it
Jed,i want raito to lose because duck hunt is lame
Jed,duck hunt is so interesting
Jed,he's not lame
Jed,eh I kinda like raito's duck hunt
Jed,he's got super neat setups
Jed,also this is some hella mediocre commentary
Jed,basically nothing but play-by-play
Jed,yea this commentary is trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Jed,imagine having evo top 8 and not bringing in the full blast zone 
Jed,What is the full blast zone?
Jed,"ee, tk, coney"
Jed,tricast
Jed,they have better commentators for the in-arena stuff
Jed,tk d1 ee
Jed,"not the best there is, but still better than this"
Jed,like both cinnpie and coney are good commentators
Jed,but they fill very similar roles
Jed,eeeeeeeh they're not great
Jed,but yeah definitely part of the problem is that they're both doing nothing but play-by-play commentary
Jed,"no analysis, nothing about player mentality, etc"
Jed,i'm so bored
Jed,by this commentary
Jed,it's great if you want to do something else and just listen tho lol
Jed,not for top 8
Jed,it was a joke
Jed,that you don't need to watch cause you can just listen
Jed,r/woosh
Jed,and they'll tell you everything that happens
Jed,fuck it im watching evo in japanese
Jed,ok japanese commentators are so much more entertaining
Jed,especially when you can make out a few words
Jed,thank you anime
Jed,tweek's PT is so nice
Jed,^
Jed,his zard looks so awkward tho
Jed,but then it goes so hard with the baits
Jed,his baits are so good with zard
Jed,how are they more entertaining when you can only understand like 5 words
Jed,"1, i can consintrate on the game more
2, the commintatiors react better"
Jed,ah
Jed,ayy smash 4 combos still works with fox? i thoiught they removed thoes
Jed,"some do, some don't"
Jed,i thought fair to upair didnt work anymore
Jed,no idea
Jed,it might be a 50/50 now
Jed,also lucina lookin clean
Jed,rip light
Jed,proto's looking super good tho
Jed,zackray leo for 7th monkaW
Jed,hope zack gets bodied

Jed,just joker things
Jed,I like zackray
Jed,but I'm still cheering for mkleo

Jed,@Ultimate we should do some fun in house tournies more often
Jed,we'll need a house first
Jed,but yeah I know what you mean
Jed,we should do em like we used to do RoA tourneys
Jed,yeah
Jed,those were super fun
Jed,speaking of we should also play rivals more
Jed,Would we include a nerf mechanic like character banning to encourage less skilled players to attend?
Jed,yeah
Jed,that's what I meant by like our old RoA stuff
Jed,thumb wrestling tourney
Jed,
Jed,if I can get my adapter working with RoA I'm totally down to keep playing it
Jed, Japanese players are gone 
Jed,rip
Jed,The west is the best

Jed,wait no
Jed,bruh
Jed,I'm dumb
Jed,Wait
Jed,3head
Jed,got confused by the winner's/loser's timeslot swap
Jed,lmao
Jed,Japan is west of the US
Jed,"yes, but it's still called the east"
Jed,don't ask
Jed,These terms are from Europe
Jed,Max likes Japan better than the USA
Jed,the east is just extra west 
Jed,
Jed,The terms are from the perspective of Europe
Jed,lol
Jed,Nope
Jed,"Japan west, change my mind"
Jed,do you guys wanna all watch together?
Jed,thats why im in here
Jed,Japan is an honorary western country
Jed,no one is joining pepehands
Jed,I would rather watch alone
Jed,same personally
Jed,"I'd be down for stuff after, but also I'll probably just pass out cause it'll be late"
Jed,i see how it is q.q
Jed,zard's so gross I love it
Jed,he was at like 45%
Jed,he was at 50
Jed,close to 70
Jed,so 60
Jed,i can math
Jed,i'm asian
Jed,ayo commentators not knowing how many jumps zard has
Jed,this is why im watching the japanese dub
Jed,do you know why tweak dropped wario?
Jed,He thought wario struggled too much at approaching and thought PT fit his style better
Jed,ah
Jed,i can see that with wario
Jed,I just remembered I got 13th at a brawl major
Jed,what a game
Jed,Out of how many entrants?
Jed,39 lol
Jed,and I got a bye cause one of my opponents DQ'd
Jed,"still, 13th at a major that was my first brawl tournament, with the second worst character in the game"
Jed,also I love how all these 'blast to the past' clips are just a great reminder of how much better of a spectator game ultimate is
Jed,Also just a better game
Jed,"yeah, but especially from a spectating perspective"
Jed,the gap there is bigger than the gameplay gap imo
Jed,imagine looking at smash 4 with rose tinted glasses
Jed,Smash 4 summarized
Jed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJfLLhnvrWE
Jed,Super Smash Bros. - Bayonetta Victory Theme (HQ)
Jed,The victory theme for Bayonetta in Super Smash Bros 4. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS. IT BELONGS TO NINTENDO.
Jed,doesn't rose-tinted imply I'm looking at it as if it was better?
Jed,r/woosh
Jed,Just counted and apparently I've mained 12 characters throughout my time playing ultimate.
Jed,Benson being unclear and then doing r/woosh when I'm confused is not clever
Jed,This grands should be cool
Jed,i'm rooting for tweak only because he's the underdog
Jed,I like Leo's style better so I'm for him
Jed,and yes zack it's implying that smash 4 was better
Jed,leo's style is closer to mine
Jed,so i might pick up joker and learn some stuff
Jed,I'm rooting for tweek cause PT
Jed,WHAT
Jed,"neither has an evo yet, right?"
Jed,pt tmight be the best character
Jed,"""PT isn't top tier"" ~Zack"
Jed,lol
Jed,I'm reconsidering that position
Jed,lol
Jed,I still think PT isn't the best
Jed,but I'm not as sure as I used to be
Jed,"top tier is something like peach joker pika lucina PT, no idea about the order"
Jed,at least prepatch
Jed,we'll have to see how things shake up postpatch
Jed,You forget Palu and Snake
Jed,i dont think palu is top 5
Jed,He said top tier not top 5
Jed,oh
Jed,tweak is so fkin good
Jed,YO
Jed,*leo
Jed,LEO'S NUUUUUTS
Jed,What a come back
Jed,mk is so fkin good
Jed,also joker busted
Jed,cabbage dog
Jed,reverse 3-0
Jed,tweek looked bad that game
Jed,I think he's shook from the three stock comeback
Jed,shit lookin like me vs zack when i read all his tricks
Jed,poor tweak
Jed,OHHHHHHHHHHHH
Jed,if that hittttttttttttttttt
Jed,TWEAK
Jed,Tweek not tweak
Jed,"he went too deep and basically got hit with the ""well I guess I'm fucked eithe way, might as well"""
Jed,benson pls
Jed,what max said
Jed,I don't think that was intentional
Jed,tewwk
Jed,It was totally intentional
Jed,I mean the sideb was
Jed,but I don't think he wanted to be in the position where he had to go for it
Jed,yeah
Jed,its over
Jed,yea leo has momentum
Jed,tweek won two games
Jed,then mkleo's on five straight
Jed,I saw that
Jed,yeah yeah
Jed,also I'm gonna crack up if the last game of the biggest smash tournament ever is to the tune of route 209
Jed,ill be a miricle if te\wk
Jed,fkit
Jed,typing is hard
Jed,twerk
Jed,joker's recovery is stupidly good
Jed,the japanese commentators ask what happened to tweak
Jed,tweek*
Jed,he was doing so well
Jed,poor tweek
Jed,ggs
Jed,hot damn
Jed,that was nutty
Jed,tweek almost stole it lol
Jed,Great grand finals
Jed,that was a good grands
Jed,wow dude he looks so emotional 
Jed,can we talk about that loser's run from mkleo tho
Jed,that was like eight or nine sets
Jed,wow that was a good guess
Jed,"it was literally 8 people, 9 sets if you count grands as two sets"
Jed,proto has a new fan
Jed,he makes lucina look fub

Jed,oh shit what happened in leff vs salem?
Jed,some beef went down
Jed,it basically went down like this
Jed,Game 1 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is behind the whole time but makes a comeback with vine whip) Game 2 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is winning but chokes and loses) Game 3 (PT vs Hero: Leffen wins fairly convincingly)
Jed,sasuage man went to go say hello to the big leaf
Jed,but then the leaf turned sideways

Jed,This might be the lamest I've ever seen hbox play
Jed,he really is killing melee
Jed,ban puff
Jed,no meme
Jed,also zain just looked so defeated after game 2 ended
Jed,man poor amsa has to fight falcon right into peach
Jed,that said he did 3-0 s2j so we'll see how this goes
Jed,there are too many lame characters in melee
Jed,matches like yoshi peach and puff marth are too slow for a top eight
Jed,yoshi vs floaties is fairly boring
Jed,yoshi is boring when amsa is losing and is thus forced to camp
Jed,he honestly does the same stuff hbox does but amsa is more likeable so people dont care
Jed,also it looks cooler
Jed,in all fairness tho llod is the one camping
Jed,llod zain losers semis maybe
Jed,none is sick
Jed,let's go none
Jed,my stream froze partway through the zain none set and I got this great screenshot just as none's getting fsmashed off stage

Jed,o
Jed,rite

Jed,DC Deck Building Strategy for Competitive Play
Jed,Lol base game wonderwoman is tier 2 fuckers
Jed,tier 2 is shit tier
Jed,It's in reverse
Jed,"6 is higest, 1 is lowest"
Jed,you buffoon
Jed,Who tf counts up
Jed,These people
Jed,the game is designed so you can play multiple heroes aslong as their tier adds up too 6 or less
Jed,
Jed,I just played better then I think I ever have in Ultimate. I was 3 stocking or nearly 3 stocking everyone I met in elite smash.
Jed,pog
Jed,"@Ultimate After years of research, I present to you my Ike matchup chart. Note: I've only played some of these matchups a single digit number of times so they may be wrong."
Jed,Ike doesn't have a plus 1 against cloud
Jed,I just suck at edge guarding
Jed,Plus i have blade beam
Jed,That can kill you at zero
Jed,On top of that i have a better neutral
Jed,Cloud has a plus 1 against ike
Jed,I also think ike loses to pit
Jed,Eeeeh I dunno about that
Jed,Nair oos hits ike
Jed,That can lead to fair and boom offstage
Jed,Plus arrows
Jed,Dead ikr
Jed,Nair oos wont hit unless crap spacing by ike
Jed,It can also antiair him
Jed,Also that combo only works at low percents
Jed,Also only preemptively cause he outranges and outspeeds pit
Jed,If you can get him off stage its doable but its super hard to win neutral at all
Jed,And he gets more off any given neutral win
Jed,Ike pit is such a fun mu.
Jed,Idk bout dark pit
Jed,It's worse cause bad arrows
Jed,So he kinda just has no place where he can wreck ike
Jed,He just sorta loses all the time instead of just most o the time
Jed,Im pretty sure fair beats his quickdraw
Jed,Imo pit ike is 55 45 respectfully

Jed,It is super easy
Jed,please do it
Jed,"This method seems to work great, I will be using it to create the actual bracket shortly. Those without a challonge account are highly encouraged to make one so they can participate. I just had Ava make one and it took her like 30 seconds."
Jed,
Jed,I'll continue this meme bracket just for fun
Jed,lightning fast rounds
Jed,You will need to refresh the page each time the round advances
Jed,"@Homies @Master Memers @Advanced Memers My voting bracket is finally here, featuring all of your finest submissions! I will be posting a link to the bracket both here and in the voting bracket channel. A challonge account is required to vote so make sure you get one of those. Don't worry, they are really easy and quick to make. Each round will be available for an indeterminate amount of time, so make sure you vote whenever you can. I will advance the round whenever it seems like everyone who would vote, has voted already. I have given a new role to everyone who gave suggestions in the submissions channel that I will use to update you guys on the progress of the voting bracket. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, remove the role from yourself. Alternatively, if you want the role and didn't get it, feel free to add it to yourself or ask a master memer to do it for you. Have fun everyone!"

Jed,Bruh
Jed,
Jed,"Goodbye, free time"
Jed,I may be getting it as well in a few weeks
Jed,you should at least try a different fire emblem game a little bit first
Jed,"just to see if the gameplay is at all up your alley, cause three houses is pretty pricy"
Jed,I just dropped ninety canadian pesos
Jed,(tax included)
Jed,"aight boys and possibly girls who have three houses, how's the difficulty in this game? ie should I play on normal or hard"
Jed,Hard pussy
Jed,
Jed,(I don't own the game)
Jed,naw I ended up doing normal+classic
Jed,Bro
Jed,You didn't even wait for a response
Jed,I waited like five minutes
Jed,you waited 3
Jed,shhh
Jed,maybe less
Jed,It was 2 minutes since my message
Jed,I'm impatient okay
Jed,jeez
Jed,Normal is too easy
Jed,From everyone iv talked to
Jed,welp too late now
Jed,Just restart
Jed,although I'm still on the prologue
Jed,so yeah
Jed,anyways if you think hard is too hard you can downgrade later
Jed,but you can never upgrade
Jed,"also side note, if I'm restarting I want to know the name of that weird chick who asks what my name is"
Jed,"so that I can give myself the same name and see if she still goes ""all y'all humans got some wack ass names"""
Jed,Sothis
Jed,I highly doubt you'll get away with it but you can try
Jed,also it'll definitely make dialogue weird eventually
Jed,I feel like its just gonna be like
Jed,"""No"""
Jed,but w/e I'll figure stuff out with pronouns cause I'm gonna be a dude
Jed,"pfft she still goes ""I shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names"""
Jed,come on nintendo
Jed,Wait are you actually allowed to do that
Jed,What is she if not a human?
Jed,wacl
Jed,wack*
Jed,based on her appearance and a few little details I've picked up Imma assume she's a dragon
Jed,also I'm 90% sure she automatically has the same birthday as you
Jed,cause she definitely comments on that one
Jed,"also, don't tell me, but if she's eventually a playable character and romance option I'm gonna crack up"
Jed,just for the theoretical
Jed,"""Do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded wife?""
""I do.""
""And do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded husband?""
""I do."""
Jed,aight they don't even change sothis' lines if your name is also sothis
Jed,"maaaaan it made my weird friendship counter thing with Sothis decrease because I took the ""guess I'll die"" dialogue option"
Jed,this has now made me afraid of choosing all the snarky options
Jed,gg everyone gone
Jed,i keep falling asleep in ma chair
Jed,just go to ur bed before you fall asleep

Jed, @Mr. Airplane
Jed,2 bird 1 stone
Jed,bruh wrench'd won shine
Jed,good shit
Jed,"leffen vs moky's about to be on, this should be good"
Jed,or leffen's gonna slaughter him
Jed,jesus moky is fast
Jed,he's nuts
Jed,side note who the hell is Kevin Maples
Jed,and why is he in top 8
Jed,everything moky does is a clip
Jed,that game was so spaghetti
Jed,"mostly leffen, but a little moky too"
Jed,game five tho
Jed,MOOOOKY
Jed,YOU'RE NUUUUTS
Jed,    
Jed,LETS GO
Jed,he SD'd super low and still went nuts
Jed,that second last stock was unreal
Jed,THE MENTAL
Jed,leffen's already tweeted lol
Jed,that was so fast
Jed,all around that might have been the best fox ditto I've seen since armada retired
Jed,can leffen ever complement his opponent
Jed,that'd be nice
Jed,https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439331114397698
Jed,Played like shit but still better than I expected with no warmup. Very unlikely I'm playing losers tomorrow. Ggs all
Jed,what a child
Jed,he's been super salty all day
Jed,
Jed,Bruh
Jed,"also, it's gonna be hbox vs ibdw, and moky vs winner of sfat s2j"
Jed,I win my first top 16 match
Jed,moky could make grands winner's side if ibdw wins
Jed,i think ibdw would win a fox ditto
Jed,if sfat beats s2j i could see ibdw winning the whole thing
Jed,yeah
Jed,"I wasn't saying moky would be favoured to make winner's side grands, just that it's not improbable"
Jed,like 1/3 maybe
Jed,@Mr. Airplane https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439884292743168
Jed,"Don't get me wrong, mokys sick and has been putting in work, he def deserves winners top 8 way more. Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"
Jed,
Jed,i mean gave him credit after giving like 8 johns and threatening to dq himself
Jed,he's been threatening to DQ himself all day lol
Jed,like several days actually
Jed,"""Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"" and its an underhanded complement"
Jed,I mean they both SD'd a bunch
Jed,and I don't think that's so bad honestly
Jed,like it's a bit john-y but w/e
Jed,and I think it's fair given his SDs game 4
Jed,I'd be hella salty
Jed,I personally have no issue with the way leffen talks. It seems he uses a variant of the Max mindset.
Jed,eh he's been really salty in general at shine
Jed,"like zero respect for anyone who beats him, puts all the blame on stuff that... he controls, at least to a degree"
Jed,every ult bracket he blames matchups he doesn't know
Jed,and like yeah he's trying to learn stuff but at a certain point you just gotta suck it up
Jed,"You've just described the Max mindset. In short ""Its always my own fault""."
Jed,That is a great mindset for a winner
Jed,yeah but I'm saying he's not doing that
Jed,"he's blaming it on other stuff, like lack of sleep, or bad scheduling, or not knowing the matchups"
Jed,Blaming SD's or playing bad or lack of matchup knowledge are all things that you did wrong
Jed,he's putting the responsability on everything but himself and his opponent
Jed,bad scheduling is the only thing you listed that is not his own fault
Jed,okay but the sleep thing is a huge john
Jed,Have you tried flying 6 timezones or so away and then having to play 13 hours in one day with no sleep
Jed,yes but he chose that
Jed,Seems hard and like a legitimate excuse
Jed,it's like blaming that you're playing a low tier
Jed,"like yeah, it's a disadvantage"
Jed,but you chose the disadvantage
Jed,he didn't have to play both games
Jed,You can choose to switch mains. You don't choose to be born European.
Jed,fly in earlier
Jed,only play one game
Jed,he was considering it
Jed,"and he doesn't get to both decide he's in the position to play both games despite everything else, then when he loses blame those things"
Jed,Its better than people dropping our constantly to preserve a reputation. Imagine a world like that.
Jed,I'm glad he entered both games
Jed,but that's not what I'm arguing about
Jed,"I don't think the move to preserve his reputation would have been to only enter one, it would have been to not bitch about things that were at least partially under his control when things don't go his way"
Jed,By reputation I mean ranking and future seeding
Jed,but that's not what we're talking about
Jed,we're talking about his behaviour and mentality
Jed,I'm saying I would rather people stay in bracket and john when they lose instead of drop out whenever they think they are not playing their absolute best to preserve their ranking.
Jed,"I'm normally on his side for a lot of things, but I think that the sequence of events of:

1) call out flaws with tournament
2) suggest how he could handle them better
3) not follow his own suggestions
4) bitch about the things he didn't avoid

is not a good look"
Jed,"once you've reached 3), you're not really in a position to complain about it"
Jed,I really don't even understand how his actions could be interpreted as points 2 and 3 but whatever.
Jed,"he goes ""I should drop out of melee so that my sleep schedule and all that is intact cause I'm not really feeling it, plus fuck shine for making such a dumb schedule so their tourney should suffer for it."" That's #2. Playing anyway at the cost of his sleep and proper warmup for either game is #3. Blaming the tournament structure and his lack of sleep and warmup for his losses is #4"
Jed,"my point isn't that he shouldn't have entered both games, it's that once he's committed to that, knowing full well all the issues it would cause him, I don't think he's entitled to complain about it"
Jed,"again, it's like choosing a low tier. Yes, playing a low tier disadvantaged you, but you knew what you were getting yourself into, so suck it up or change characters. Don't blame the game for not making your character good"
Jed,Welcome to 2019 everybody. A world in which a minecraft parody song by Captain Sparklez is the top trending song of the month. Lol how did this happen.

Jed,
Jed,Also the grenade recovery looks awful
Jed,He's super vulnerable
Jed,Banjo sucks
Jed,
Jed,I don't see him being any better than bottom 10 characters
Jed,Maybe even bottom 3
Jed,It's wack cause everyone on Reddit is like wow his recovery is so good
Jed,But it clearly isn't
Jed,I tested with Ava yesterday and down throw into side B can be mashed out of well into kill%
Jed,Yeah he also sucks at killing

Jed,Crisi 3
Jed,Forever
Jed,Evil
Jed,I had the weirdest discussion with my housemates today
Jed,we spent like 45 minutes discussing one question
Jed,"""Can a person be taller than they are old?"""
Jed,any baby
Jed,done
Jed,it spiralled off into like four hours of weird random stuff and it was a great time
Jed,"Chris, explain"
Jed,because the deeper you get into the specifics the more insane this conversation can become
Jed,babies are 0 years of age
Jed,babies are taller than 0 of any measurement for length
Jed,Therefore yes
Jed,A person can be taller than their age
Jed,yeah that was me and one other guy's argument
Jed,"but it got into a convoluted discussion of the meaning of age, weird semantics, and we eventually ended up talking about quantum physics"
Jed,Interesting
Jed,...
Jed,...
Jed,"basically one guy's point was that age cannot be zero, since its the amount of time that has passed since something came into existence, and if no time has passed, its age just flat out doesn't exist rather than being zero"
Jed,"Well okay, even if you are one year old, you are probably taller than one of any significant form of measurement"
Jed,Or once it does begin to exist after itnhas been born
Jed,yeah but no kind of measurement was specified
Jed,It's age will be somewhere between 0 and 1
Jed,Therefore my original statement holds true aswell
Jed,"also the fact that time and distance aren't really comparable, regardless of unit"
Jed,which is how we ended up in quantum physics
Jed,I mean I guess but in the context we can assume we are just comparing absolute values
Jed,can we though
Jed,do you even know the context
Jed,the context was wack as hell
Jed,
Jed,it came from a badly translated article about yao ming's daughter
Jed,how we got to that is another story
Jed,but also it's late and I should sleep
Jed,so gnight all
Jed,Goodnight
Jed,I was typing periods to test my lag since I wasn't able to send messages
Jed,Those periods took several minutes to actually register as sent
Jed,alright played a banjo online

Jed,imagine needing fingers
Jed,smh
Jed,"i still got 17th because i won in winners, but i coulda done much better"
Jed,"had my first kingston weekly since april 2018 yesterday:
ultimate (https://kingstonsmash.challonge.com/KU33): 38 people, I got 9th, but only because I lost to 4th seed (who won the whole thing), and then immediately got the top seed cause he sandbagged with banjo in winner's. Looking at who I would have had to fight if I he hadn't sandbagged, I would have had three people I've never lost to, so I probably should have gotten 4th. Also Lucas is a super wack matchup that I've never played so I'm glad I beat both the ones I fought.
melee (https://challonge.com/raw0xlb4): smaller tournament because there's a bigger event today, got 4/17, lost to 1st and 2nd, and all close games (0-2 for both, but still mostly last-hit games). Also, my marth is not ready for sheik. Beat a pr'd sheik where he jv3'd my marth and then I double two-stocked him with samus. Got 2 PR wins so I think I'm well on my way to this season's PR.
various traditional fighters that didn't have brackets: I'm nutty at unist even on a controller I'm not used to. Guilty gear is really fun but also really fucking hard, and I'm gonna be really upset if I end up with yet another fighting game where I hate the visual design of my best character."
Jed,"now today I've got a bigger melee tournament that should have more of the PR (yesterday only had half the PR), and more people in general, and a proper unist bracket that I think I'll be able to place in the money for, so long as I can stay somewhat consistent with a weird control scheme"
Jed,When my life is crumbling apart but it’s my birthday so I gotta play it cool 
Jed,
Jed,@Ultimate Someone fight me
Jed,I can't seem to join voice in here so I'll be in frostbite 1
Jed,tfw you dont have frostbyte 1
Jed,@Galf
Jed,Going to a tournament wish me luck. Also what character should I play @Ultimate ?
Jed,Banjo Kazooie @Max
Jed,No
Jed,Pokemon trainer
Jed,Then why ask
Jed,
Jed,Welp I did terribly in melee
Jed,"Between pools and bracket, 1-4"
Jed,Mostly respectable losses but I feel like I should have won 3 of them
Jed,"On the flip side, second in unist"
Jed,Got the reset bracket into get 3-0d classic
Jed,well zack
Jed,looks like its time to come back and play me in ultimate instead
Jed,i lost to two pts so gotta grind 
Jed,I'm 1-1 right now. Likely fighting a Samus next
Jed,ya boi made five entire dollars from UNIST today
Jed,and only spent 14 on the tournament and food
Jed,and honestly I'm more happy that I didn't get 3rd than that I got 2nd
Jed,because getting 3rd would have involved losing to someone who started playing unist last night
Jed,he brought me to game 5 last round
Jed,Basically double 3 stocked the Samus. My Palu is looking clean.
Jed,Next match is the winner of an inkling ditto. Anyone got any tips for this matchup?
Jed,@Max just play bowser 4head
Jed,@Sak von Sak wanna jame jamer?
Jed,Beat the inkling but lost to the same wolf player I lost to round 1 rip.
Jed,Went 3-2
Jed,Got 7th
Jed,Got seeded terrible since no one knew who I was so I'm satisfied with my performance. Aside from 1 game of ike I went all Palu.
Jed,i think
Jed,bowser is actually bad vs heavies
Jed,10/10 would recommend abandoned 1800s Masonic cemeteries
Jed,Bro
Jed,Bro
Jed,We deadass were leaving and heard laughing around us
Jed,We looked it up later and it's common for people to be chased out and get scratches from a witch who was hung and buried there
Jed,And we all thought we were good but we got home and one of my friend checked his back and he had a long scratch mark down his back
Jed,That cemetery is the #1 most haunted place in oregon
Jed,Are you sure he didn't just get scratched on a tree branch or something?
Jed,It was 3 scratches going sideways across his lower back
Jed,It didn't look like a scratch from a bush
Jed,And one of our other friends refused to go because he had gotten a deep scratch the last time he went
Jed,MonkaW
Jed,We were chilling and my stomach just dropped and I told them we had to get out of there before 12
Jed,I had a feeling bad shit would happen if we were in there when it hit 12
Jed,It was wack
Jed,Just checked yesterdays bracket and I actually got 5th not 7th
Jed,nice
Jed,Guy who double eliminated me got 2nd

Jed,@Master Memers @Advanced Memers Does anyone wanna play Red Dragon Inn?
Jed,a hwat
Jed,Tabletop
Jed,How about poker?
Jed,Come play this
Jed,Maybe poker later
Jed,This game is really fun
Jed,I like the rabbit character
Jed,Well come play
Jed,
Jed,I'm home in 1.5 hours
Jed,The game is not fun but the art on that particular character's cards is rather amusing
Jed,@Max
Jed,I'll play poker
Jed,Poker?
Jed,Ayy
Jed,Let's go
Jed,Max I read a short book on poker
Jed,What @Trapezoider ?
Jed,So I don't suck now
Jed,I mean I still suck just not as bad
Jed,I've done a fair bit of reading on poker so I like to think I'm pretty decent when I'm full tryharding
Jed,But doing that means folding like 70%+ of hands so I rarely do
Jed,It just becomes boring for everyone
Jed,Pls play
Jed,You're just folding most of the time anyways
Jed,What the heck
Jed,truth
Jed,Chris I'll play as soon as I'm home
Jed,Your game then poker
Jed,I mean is that not pro poker anyways
Jed,foding 70% sounds about right
Jed,"Like I said, that is the correct way to play if you want to win, it just is more fun to play a lot of hands."
Jed,according to my dad i'm weird in that i play the same whether or not money is involved
Jed,I would never play poker for real money
Jed,i mean even for somehting liek 5 bucks
Jed,I am opposed to gambling
Jed,fair enough i suppose
Jed,@Trapezoider we playin poker soon or wha t
Jed,Did y’all end up actually playing poker
Jed,Hello
Jed,No we did not
Jed,I thought I would be home sooner
Jed,But repairing my window took longer than expected
Jed,Smh
Jed,@Zain Can you use your mode powers to get me a massive CSV of every message sent in chillin ?
Jed,I'm not sure that is possible
Jed,This is so sad
Jed,I'm learning about language models
Jed,and I wanted to train a net to generate text that is basically the average of frostbite
Jed,
Jed,Just go highlight everything
Jed,
Jed,I would also like to see some data science with the chat
Jed,you could probably make a bot that would just scrape the entirety of a channel
Jed,Like who has sent the most messages etc.
Jed,"I'm not positive cause I""ve never worked with discord's api 'n stuff, but it should be doable"
Jed,Its totally possible i recalla  friend of mine doing something similar
Jed,not for frostbite obvs but
Jed,Can you reach out to him and find out how
Jed,I could train something by the end of the day
Jed,It would be like the olive garden commercials
Jed,sounds neat
Jed,@Trapezoider just ctrl+a 
Jed,>.<
Jed,
Jed,oh god
Jed,what have they done to discord light theme
Jed,
Jed,I don't use that shit
Jed,they made it so ugly
Jed,like soooo ugly
Jed,Insinuating that it wasn't already ugly
Jed,What did they change?
Jed,they removed the darker parts and just made everything the lighter version so now there's no more contrast and logical grouping of things that go together and everything just sorta blends together and looks awful
Jed,and I don't know why they thought it was an improvement
Jed,my best guess is they've just decided to drive the last holdouts over to dark theme and then delete light mode
Jed,OH ITS AWFUL

Jed,"Millennials, also known as Generation Y (or simply Gen Y), are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted definition. Millennials are sometimes referred to as ""echo boomers"" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The characteristics of millennials vary by region and by individual, and the group experiences a variety of social and economic conditions, but they are generally marked by their coming of age in the Information Age, and are comfortable in their usage of digital technologies and social media."

Jed,He's cool but he's no beghoul
Jed,
Jed,"bored between classes so I made a tier list, come give me shit for my shit opinions"
Jed,why does it only go to C tier
Jed,because the game's well enough balanced that it doesn't need to go further down
Jed,"I've seen games that don't go below B tier (shoutouts to UNIST, although technically it has Enkidu tier, containing just Enkidu, because he is terrible. Still got 5th at evo though.)"
Jed,I'll have my tier list out in a few days
Jed,So I will refrain from commenting for now
Jed,cloud needs to be lower
Jed,he's in b- tier
Jed,there's a reason why the 2 best cloud players are dropping cloud and why i'm taking a break from smash
Jed,"eeeh I don't think he's that low, but I might have put him a bit high. He's still got good tools and I feel like he mops up a solid chunk of the characters below him"
Jed,but there's just characters who are more or less better cloud
Jed,what tools? when all his moves have 0 priority and trade with almost anything
Jed,"they aren't that bad, and they're pretty safe, if not plus. Also he has solid juggling and deals hella damage, and always has a comeback/blowup factor because his callout tools (fsmash, anything with limit) are really strong"
Jed,UPAIR LOSES AND TRADES WITH BOWSER NAIR
Jed,FUCKING BOWSER NAIR
Jed,you can't tell me cloud has good shit
Jed,when i've played him the most
Jed,bowser nair is amazing what are you talking about
Jed,everything loses to bowser nair
Jed,barring insane disjoints
Jed,hense my point. cloud sucks
Jed,"which cloud doesn't have anymore, he only has moderate disjooints"
Jed,losing to something that almost everyone else also loses to does not make your character bad
Jed,^
Jed,Benson your point there made no sense
Jed,my point is that cloud's juggling game isnt great
Jed,he struggles to kill
Jed,and his disjoints suck
Jed,his moves have no priority
Jed,and his recovery is bad
Jed,I'd like to point out that everything you just mentioned except the recovery thing applies to the entire chunk immediately above him
Jed,"duck hunt,  the links, g&w, shulk"
Jed,shulk at least has decent disjoints but also his juggling sucks
Jed,and the poor boy can't kill without putting himself hugely at risk
Jed,he has smash art
Jed,at least that helps
Jed,"which puts him hugely at risk as well, it's terrible for closing out games or making comebacks"
Jed,also a great way to lose leads
Jed,"but yes, he's a better character than cloud, which is why he's near the top of the tier as opposed to the bottom"
Jed,cloud has a hard time dealing with people who constantly run away + sometimes can't kill until he lands a unstale move or throw at 220%
Jed,on top of that his grab sucks balls
Jed,yeah he's got issues
Jed,but so does everyone at this point in the list
Jed,"and he's able to safely poke with kill moves, which is a big deal"
Jed,unless it's perfectly spaced in which it only hits the shield and not aimed at the opponent then yes
Jed,but other than that
Jed,no
Jed,his bair is safe only if you spot dodge
Jed,and his fair loses to fast oos options
Jed,also parrying is a thing
Jed,which makes bair unsafe
Jed,which is his safest move
Jed,yeah but parrying makes... basically everything unsafe
Jed,so it's not a super valid issue
Jed,@Max @Sak von Sak @TheRainbowpixelz @The Rona anyone down for some smash
Jed,wanna play some ike
Jed,"got another lecture in 20 minutes, I'd be down after that tho"
Jed,just got back from class
Jed,so in like an hour and a half or so
Jed,i have class later 
Jed,at 5
Jed,also kameron come shit on my tier list
Jed,I'll play
Jed,your tier list trash
Jed,or join the argument about how I placed cloud
Jed,cloud sucks and is bottom of mid tier
Jed,"you put mega man, zss, chrom, ness, gren, pac, shulk way too low"
Jed,"I don't think zss deserves to be any higher imo, and the rest might be a bit better but I feel like results on them are all dropping off (except shulk)"
Jed,imagine thinking mega man and pac results are dropping off
Jed,I may have just not seen any
Jed,kameme won an s tier 
Jed,oh
Jed,solo mm?
Jed,p much
Jed,mostly megaman
Jed,hm might move him to like around pac then
Jed,bowser being above pac and mega man is a joke
Jed,megaman is better than bowser
Jed,not sure about pac
Jed,well :/ it depends  on the mu
Jed,they are not characters I know a ton about
Jed,it wasn't exactly an extensively researched tier list
Jed,most of megaman and pac is theory crafting
Jed,judging the megaman placing by japanese players at evo megaman and duck hunt have gone up in my tier lsit
Jed,but there's still not enough information via games to justify if they are actually good or not
Jed,"we'll see, my assumption is that like most not-super-popular characters that are being labbed out, there'll be a bunch of new tech found, their results will shoot up, then people will start figuring out the matchup and the results will drop a bit, but still be noticeably higher than initially"
Jed,"so it's hard to say at what point any characters like that are, especially if you're me and haven't even noticed the good results"
Jed,you've seen that duck hunt and how much safe pressure it can put out
Jed,with pac-man ive already seen people learn how to play around his neutral b galiga
Jed,we just have to wait and see more to fully get a grasp on these zoners

Jed,Vote Now! [Dig a ditch (in moderate weather)] [Do Research]
Jed,thoughts?
Jed,Melee might be more fun with only battlefield tbh
Jed,id be down to ban puff
Jed,That would be even better
Jed,Banning things to make the game more fun is perfectly fine in my opinion
Jed,Like TF2 6s does
Jed,tf2 6s wasnt really banning things
Jed,it was building a competitive game from the ground up
Jed,If heavy had GRU and his slowing minigun legal he would have seen play
Jed,it was a 'constructive ruleset'
Jed,"When hungrybox is in attendance, Ultimate top 8 probably has a faster average game speed. How depressing that one character can slow down an entire game."
Jed,Just ban Hungrybox
Jed,when he is maybe gonna lose he plays lame
Jed,
Jed,puff encourages non-interaction
Jed,Characters should not have multiple jumps
Jed,Meta knight had the same issue of air camping
Jed,air camping inherently limits the options of your opponent making it bad to approach
Jed,

Jed,@Mr. Airplane do you not want to do research?
Jed,dreamland is basically impossible for marth vs puff cause pivot tipper doesnt kill until the percents dont work anymore
Jed,It connects and kills during an 8% window

Jed,"It depends on what the fitness challenge is. Maybe its ""Who can achieve the highest proportional increase in weight lifting"" or ""Who can keep the highest average heart rate over the month??"" IDK

I know the bois are tryna get fit. Way easier to achieve when you gamify it and do it with friends"

Jed,this is some wack gamer mouse design
Jed,but it's apparently a crazy good mouse and only $50
Jed,p sure its to reduce weight by using less material
Jed,could be wrong tho
Jed,yeah
Jed,but it looks so gamer
Jed,I bought it
Jed,(current mouse is dying)
Jed,which is weird cause my mouse i can put extra weights in to make ti heavier
Jed,which i do
Jed,I actually like lighter mice
Jed,doesn't have the same heft but also it just feels super free and easy
Jed,idk for me it feels like i can be more accurate with a heavier mouse
Jed,prob cause im adjusted to it now tho
Jed,also I do a lot of my mousing with my fingers and wrist rather than my arm
Jed,so light is a lot easier
Jed,I say as i just overshot a program on my taskbar and opened steam
Jed,lol

Jed,Okay the ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion is wack
Jed,
Jed,Are you talking about the TV series or the movie?
Jed,Theres a movie?
Jed,:0
Jed,Im talking about the TV series
Jed,"There is a movie ""End of Evangelion"""
Jed,That fixes the ending
Jed,FR???
Jed,yes
Jed,THANK GOD
Jed,I was kind of dissatisfied 
Jed,you should still watch the zero budget TV series end though because its funny
Jed,Thanks for letting me know buddy
Jed,It was really zero budget?
Jed,no
Jed,I thought this was supposed to be intentionally artsy
Jed,but they did have some problems
Jed,it was not meant to be like this
Jed,Thats good to know
Jed,yeah they flat out ran out of money
Jed,oof
Jed,which is hilarious to me since it ended up being one of the most profitable anime franchises ever
Jed,just... not during production
Jed,it's weird how iconic that show is
Jed,like I bet if you played the theme song
Jed,most people would recognize it and go
Jed,hmmm I know this song but not where it is from
Jed,"There is a video called something like ""Can you live entirely off Evangelion Merchandise?"". There is so much of it that you basically can."
Jed,spoilers
Jed,I'm reading online
Jed,"and people are saying ""They ran out of money"" is a myth"
Jed,can someone source this please?
Jed,They had problems with the original ending being too similar to a terrorist attack and thought it would be in poor taste to release it is the long answer.
Jed,"honestly it's not that weird that the show ended up being as iconic as it was, at least within anime. It kinda revolutionized an entire genre and brought a ton of new ideas and directions into the medium and is a huge part of why anime is the way it is, but despite that no one's quite managed to replicate what made it work. The weird thing is that it's so recognizable to people who don't know much of anything about anime"
Jed,facts
Jed,"I didn't know what the show was until gigukk made the ""Basically, Netflix's Evangelion"""
Jed,But before seeing that I had inadvertently seen tons of references to the show around the internet
Jed,It was a good watch
Jed,Time for the film
Jed,dayum I've got the ESL new york finals in the background and apparently EG just beat Astralis 16-3 on Astralis' pick?
Jed,let's go NA
Jed,"Honestly, I didn't even know EG had a CSGO team."
Jed,they bought NRG's roster
Jed,"like, a week ago"
Jed,I only know about it because they keep mentioning it on commentary

Jed,@Ultimate ?
Jed,There's a common concept that to be really good at something you first have to suck at it and fail a bunch
Jed,However usually people who end up really good at something start fairly good at the thing
Jed,Yes
Jed,So it's a dumb and ultimately harmful concept
Jed,You are only getting half of that right
Jed,"Your ability to master any skill is pretty much directly related to your IQ. 

Two dudes start learning a game for instance. Jim's IQ is 130 while Bob's is 100. 

If they both practice 8 hours a day, by the end of the month Jim is pretty much guaranteed to be way better than Bob. 

When they started they both sucked and failed to play the game well. What differentiates them is the Jim was able to learn and reduce his failures/attempts WAY faster than Bob."
Jed,TLRD: To be good at something you do have to fail... BUT your number of failures will be vastly lower than someone with a lower IQ and you will master the skill quicker.
Jed,Okay get the fuck out of here. You did not just start typing the MOMENT I open discord @Mr. Airplane
Jed,
Jed,MonkaW
Jed,
Jed,I am watching you
Jed,I mean uh
Jed,D:
Jed,monkaS
Jed,@Trapezoider so because I picked up melee quicker than you I have a higher iq right?
Jed,jed actual 
Jed,Yes
Jed,@Jed
Jed,Apparently reaction time is indicative of higher IQ as well
Jed,I wouldn't be surprised if you have more brain points
Jed,Oh wack
Jed,
Jed,Alright everyone. I have returned to my name

Jed,How will he sruvive without his assistant
Jed,The Baron is on vacation in Fiji
Jed,Ah understandable
Jed,lmao I'm boutta go skydiving
Jed,try not to die
Jed,I will
Jed,Skydiving is idiotic in my opinion
Jed,Why
Jed,cause I was like hey what if I went skydiving
Jed,It's probably safer than driving a car
Jed,oh
Jed,Not you
Jed,lmao yeah I said that to my mom
Jed,I mean is true
Jed,Just cause something seems scary
Jed,Doesn't mean it is scary
Jed,I feel like you should do things you think are scary
Jed,/dangerous
Jed,Yeah Mrs.Max is afraid of flying even though its statistically safer than driving
Jed,He means my Mom ^

Jed,so many formulas to memorize
Jed,I've never had an open book test
Jed,Is that normal?
Jed,depends
Jed,it's fairly common in courses like this one where there's a ton of formulas to memorize that aren't as important as actually knowing how to apply them
Jed,zack stop messaging us

Jed,
Jed,oh wow that looks really complicated and professsional
Jed,yeah
Jed,he's mad talented
Jed,and also just works really hard
Jed,yep hard work and a lotta time dedication can get you pretty far
Jed,but you also have to be smart about it. I spent years making super slow progress because I was really stupid about how I was going about drawing
Jed,Yeah but I mean for really skilled artists like me our talents just develope naturally
Jed,I guess that's just absolute savants

Jed,"So as many of you know I've started a new campaign and for this one i wanted to have an introduction so that there could something in between starting situation and when the players actually started to play. When i was going about writing this i said to myself it would really suck if i were to fuck this up when i have to read it so why not just record it and play it for the players over some music. I decided ultimately to not do that and it went perfectly fine but while i did not put into practice my recording idea i did however record 30 clips of me trying to record this introduction and on all of the 29 clips i failed. I ended up getting pretty mad the last one in this video was perfect, but all the rest are just me raging so i asked some people if they wanted to see it and they said they did so here for your enjoyment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YFx7qlhq0&feature=youtu.be"

Jed,month at the most
Jed,bruh what do you even do while in solitary confinement
Jed,like do they give you books to read or something
Jed,nope
Jed,at least for the most part
Jed,so do you just sit there
Jed,yes sir
Jed,i wouldnt do it for more than like a week then
Jed,i think i would start going insane after that
Jed,like i get mega bored during a 4 hour car ride

Jed,@TheRainbowpixelz apex @SWIRL GIRL
Jed,yeet
Jed,sheik is so bad in melee
Jed,actually awful recovery
Jed,m2k beat hbox
Jed,hype
Jed,Plup beat Salem lololol
Jed,he took game 1 vs tweek
Jed,ohhh
Jed,Is it on stream?
Jed,no
Jed,he lost 3-1 lol
Jed,plup and armada both placed 17th
Jed,mew2king really is the coolest marth
Jed,Did leo not got to big house
Jed,no
Jed,Melee saved
Jed,Praise almighty Mang0
Jed,Zain is so good what the heck
Jed,that girl sceaming in the background fucked over leffen
Jed,i would be hella tilted
Jed,That's the mang0
Jed,Long live melee
Jed,
Jed,Yes
Jed,ay I broke my 9th place ultimate curse
Jed,by getting 13th
Jed,still counts
Jed,I was about to type a congratulatory message...
Jed,(also in all fairness this was a monthly with a bunch of out-of-town people)
Jed,(so there were like twenty more people than usual)
Jed,King's Court?
Jed,yeah
Jed,Big House melee was great to watch because Hbox got eliminated early
Jed,"I did maintain my UNIST 2nd place curse though, so I got $5"
Jed,which failed to cover the $17 I spent on entering four tournaments
Jed,also yeah I'm sad I missed top 8
Jed,from looking at the bracket it looks nuts
Jed,What other two did you enter?
Jed,"melee singles, ult singles, ult dubs, unist"
Jed,"also tekken, which was free"
Jed,game is wack
Jed,"""So I jump into the air, you see? and then I fly down at you?""
""Yeah.""
""It's an overhead. But technically it's unblockable. But it can be blocked low."""
Jed,???
Jed,ayo what
Jed,zackray's playing corrin
Jed,he lost
Jed,yeah he got pretty booped
Jed,but not much more on corrin than on joker
Jed,nairo's playing DK what is this tournament
Jed,Zackray in summit
Jed,Game and Watch looks super annoying to play against
Jed,Up B and his smash attacks are so spammable
Jed,And up air
Jed,alright boys
Jed,Im hype
Jed,I just spent an hour
Jed,Trying to find a copy of this textbook that is $300

Jed,

Jed,
Jed,What is in the text bubble?
Jed,optimaaaaal
Jed,
Jed,Uhh
Jed,My game is fucked
Jed,Guys is it just me or are kamerons drawings getting better? 
Jed,how dare you. Kameron's art is already at peak perfection. It cannot ascend any higher.
Jed,Honestly
Jed,every time kameron draws the bar for perfection simply moves up

Jed,Dolphin Emulator 2019.10.08 - 00.34.37.03.DVR Trim
Jed,oh hey indivisible came out today
Jed,must... finish.... assignment... first
Jed,"bleh I'm strongly considering just not handing in this assignment. It's only worth ~6% of my mark, and as far as I've been able to tell I'm following the instructions to a T and it's not working (so I assume I'm misunderstanding something, but I have no idea what). Went for office hours and the TA just never showed up. I could go in for a different TA's office hours tomorrow (it's due tonight so I'd be taking late marks but I'd still get most of the grades), but with all the other stuff I have on my plate I honestly think it might not be worth it."
Jed,That sucks dude
Jed,this course is such a nightmare
Jed,What class is this?
Jed,neural nets
Jed,the content is really interesting
Jed,but the prof sucks
Jed,and 2/3 TAs suck
Jed,"and the lecture slides suck, and the assignments are missing like half the information you'd need to do the assignment, and there's zero feedback on anything"
Jed,every time this year you've seen me complain about a course it's been this one
Jed,Is there a department head that you could talk to about this?
Jed,This honestly sounds really annoying
Jed,"probably, but they're notoriously backed up one everything"
Jed,@Ultimate yall wanna do some fun ultimate thing later
Jed,like a character crew battle?
Jed,I'd be down if I can get all my stuff done
Jed,that's why im working rn

Jed,So
Jed,Some of these seem like they would take years to finish
Jed,Do you understand implicit differentiation?
Jed,"I don't remember what implicit differentiation is, but I know how I'd solve this normally"
Jed,Mostly
Jed,so I dunno how much help I'll be
Jed,I can help
Jed,I know what the rules are but sometimes Isolating y' is very hard
Jed,just use wolfram alpha kappa
Jed,I want to understand it though

Jed,or is it just my incineroar and lucario
Jed,just cause you're annoying doesnt mean the chars are idiot

Jed,on the flip side I have so many boxes of whippets
Jed,Uhhhhh
Jed,Please tell me whippets are something else in canada
Jed,Isn't that a drug?
Jed,lol no
Jed,It's nitrous oxide in canisters and you huff it
Jed,But I assume it's something else
Jed,Unless Canada has some lit grocery stores
Jed,
Jed,Ah
Jed,I see
Jed,they are very addicting though
Jed,but usually more expensive than I would pay for
Jed,but it was 2 boxes for $5 as opposed to one box for $3.50
Jed,oh i thought whippets were dogs
Jed,they are that as well
Jed,two boxes of dogs for $5 would be pretty amazing
Jed,although that'd be a lot of dogs to take care of
Jed,but I could probably sell them at a reasonable markup
Jed,i wonder how many dogs comes in one box
Jed,@Ultimate anyone downs?
Jed,thats a little personal of a question dont ya think
Jed,yes
Jed,i desire information

Jed,I should get one
Jed,I just need a way to set up a push to talk that I can use while playing a game with a controller. My current thought is some kind of foot pedal.
Jed,Just use a button on the controller

Jed,you fought the spirit of my frustration at this neural nets assignment
Jed,yoshi link might be 100 0
Jed,that matchup feels very impossible
Jed,@Trapezoider @The Rona Rocket launched
Jed,"Congrats, you have gotten farther than both me and Andrew"
Jed,aight ya boi went on a run today https://kingstonsmash.challonge.com/KU39
Jed,Kingston Smash Ultimate 2019 - Weekly #39 - Challonge
Jed,"(also got 7th in melee, was one stock away from beating #3 in the city too but then I choked, and continued my unbroken string of 2nd places in unist, although I took a game off the best player in the city this time)"
Jed,Nice losers run
Jed,thanks :)
Jed,I played such a weird mix of characters
Jed,but like 2/3 incineroar and it worked really well
Jed,I made one guy soooo mad and ended up getting my first PR win for the season
Jed,"he won game 1, I took game 2, then he swapped off his main (dedede) for roy which was hilarious cause of all those incineroar-roy games I played against max where I learned to cheese the poor boy (runoff lariat), then he pulled a PT and I showed him why you don't try to zone out incineroar"
Jed,I feel bad for him. Incineroar would be in gouge eyes out tier of my annoying tier list.
Jed,yeah a little bit
Jed,I played some Bowser today
Jed,oh no
Jed,man is easy
Jed,are we gonna have three
Jed,no
Jed,yeah he's pretty straight forward
Jed,I just wanted to prove a point
Jed,have I ever pretended like he's not easy?
Jed,That wasn't the point. I was proving that he is good.
Jed,I always thought he was pretty good too?
Jed,he's at worst upper mid tier
Jed,These points were not directed at you
Jed,fair
Jed,I learned some new ledge trapping tricks with Palu as well in my session today against Benson.
Jed,I also finally hit this one unist combo in a real match for once
Jed,the one and only time I get to feel like mika actually has good damage
Jed,"costs half my meter as a starter though, and the other half as the ender, but it does like 50% of most characters health"
Jed,"was also the first time I didn't feel totally outmatched against harley (he did still 3-1 3-0 me between winner's and grand finals, but most of the games were really close)"
Jed,Have you lost to him for every 2nd place finish?
Jed,"naw, the weeks he wasn't there I lost to different people -_-"
Jed,but he is responsible for most of them
Jed,ay I just found that discord has a setting that puts light theme pretty much back to how it used to be
Jed,it's not quite as good but now I have a better alternative to dark mode so I'm going for it
Jed,dark sidebar pog
Jed,yup
Jed,although the old light theme had a lighter grey for the sidebar
Jed,it also had a darker bit for the users sidebar
Jed,but it's still better than all dark
Jed,but new light theme kinda nice tho

Jed,i need a topic for my persuasive speech
Jed,uhhhh
Jed,there's one restriction
Jed,the topic has to have a call to action that students can act upon immediately
Jed,Easy one that people will like is a call for more environmentally friendly behavior.
Jed,"You can talk about the importance of participating in a democracy. Cite low voter turnout percentages, and encourage voting in the next election."
Jed,yeah but im pretty sure that the person right before me is doing that already
Jed,the environment one
Jed,oh snap voting could be good
Jed,except that i dont do it
Jed,Do they know that though
Jed,im losing my mind
Jed,the topic should be a formation of a think tank for people who can't think of things to write about for schoolwork

Jed,i think literally every student hates it
Jed,I had one professor that gave his own custom paper homework and it was the best ever
Jed,The start of class was dedicated to helping people who didn't understand it
Jed,I miss back when math classes weren't 3 hours long
Jed,i hate any class thats 3 hours long
Jed,regardless of subject
Jed,tbh math is probably the subject I can most stand for that long a time period
Jed,It is really easy to burn time with long problems
Jed,guys im really tired despite getting entirely adequate amounts of sleep what do
Jed,maybe im sick
Jed,That's just life dude
Jed,"Could be a symptom of depression, but I'm not sure on that"

Jed,F
Jed,Feel better buddy
Jed,I haven't grown up in a couple hours so I think I'm fine

Jed,i am watching stuff
Jed,"weekly summary:
7th in melee, lost to 1st and 2nd place, had pretty close sets against both of em (last stock game 3 with 2nd, two last hit games with 1st)

5th in ultimate, lost to 1st and 4th. Got bodied by the guy who won, game 5 last hit with the 4th place guy (who I kinda sorta hate as a human being and he said he'd quit if he ever lost to incineroar, so I'm real sad about that)

2nd in unist as always, but probably featured the ""highlight"" of the weekly, where between the last game of winner's finals and first two games of grands, I landed one hit. In those three games (six rounds) I was perfected 5 times. I have never been so completely destroyed in any game ever. Not playing melee against Ryan Ford or Moky, or ringing for plat 6s when I was in steel. Holy fuck I got completely and utterly shredded."
Jed,I also ate an excellent burrito that was far beyond my capacity for spiciness but it was so damn good that I kept taking these huge bites and then dying for the next five minutes then being really excited to take another bite
Jed,My younger self resonates with this so much
Jed,I love salsa but young Max had a very bad spice tolerance

Jed,                                                                                                                              
Jed,
Jed,Man imagine playing  cowboi game when you arent even american
Jed,smfh
Jed,Game fun as fuck though
Jed,imagine buying rdr2 twice
Jed,literally spending 120 dollars on a video game
Jed,Literally didn't buy it the first time
Jed,My dad bought it for himself
Jed,I just mooched
Jed,Kameron out here thinking we pay 120 dollars for 2 video games
Jed,
Jed,TRUE
Jed,not in canadian schmeckles my friend
Jed,my b i meant 400 chuck e cheese coupons
Jed,^
Jed,there you go
Jed,@Trapezoider where'd you find my dpotg vods?
Jed,@Cs:go any1?
Jed,Youtub
Jed,Can yousend me the link I couldn't find it
Jed,@Cs:go
Jed,need a fifth
Jed,Someone just sent me a pic on Snapchat of them holding a pumpkin spiced latte and saying “still holding onto those fall vibes”
Jed,Like ofc you are it’s still fall you dumb bitch
Jed,"I think theyre saying that the ""fall vibes"" have become tangible through the latte that theyve had for a while"
Jed,kinda deep if you think about it
Jed,Ok push guy
Jed,Ok now I go this way
Jed,People in r/smashbros don't understand how balance work
Jed,Actually neither do blizzard tbh
Jed,Whenever you talk about the general public
Jed,They generally have no idea how to balance a game
Jed,you aren't supposed to buff bad character's weakness or nerf good character's strengths
Jed,you buff bad character's inherent strengths and nerf good characters inherent weaknesses
Jed,that keeps characters different and interesting
Jed,like people on r/smashbros are saying to buff incineroar's speed
Jed,but that would not make any sense with how incineroar works as a character
Jed,he's slow because his moves are really good and cover a lot of space
Jed,same as people who wanted to nerf roadhog's hook but make him more tanky
Jed,the tradeoff for roadhog was that he can have a high burst damage output but you risk dieing and feeding ult charge
Jed,oh god fast incineroar would be horrifying
Jed,but hurr durr he a tank he shouldnt do damage but he should have damage resistances like every other tank that already exists but have more utility than hog when you remove his hook's usefullness
Jed,also yea fast incineroar would be stupid
Jed,just let PT play as any three pokemon
Jed,he'd just be better bowser
Jed,why would you want that r/smashbros
Jed,not pt incin
Jed,becasue r/smashbros is not a particularly smart environment
Jed,but like these are core concepts of game balance
Jed,also that was a suggestion for a different dumb change
Jed,it would be funny
Jed,like preschooler level stuff
Jed,but also wack as fuck
Jed,yeah
Jed,you only nerf a strong character's strengths if you didn't actually mean to make it a strength/overdid it
Jed,you dont remove characters weaknesses when they bad or every char is gonna feel the same
Jed,^
Jed,true
Jed,like it's good that sm4sh took out diddy down throw up air up air up air
Jed,and made bayo stuff less consistent (for all the good that did)
Jed,like the only change I would make to pika is make him bigger or make his moves do less damage
Jed,but in general if you take away both strengths and weaknesses you end up with a bland cast
Jed,because fast safe moves and an insane recover are supposed to be pika's strengths
Jed,imo I'd make him upb on stage more punishable
Jed,but being small and doing a lot of damage are not
Jed,it's kind of a dumb neutral tool
Jed,yea mayb
Jed,but that would fall into your thing of a strength being too strong
Jed,like joker for example is a fundementally broken char
Jed,"but yeah his whole point is that he's small, fast, and has high-execution stuff that's really good"
Jed,because his strengths and weaknesses do not adhere to the design of the game
Jed,yeah he's a weird one
Jed,I can't really think of a good way to fix him without totally redesigning him as a character
Jed,so he should be changed entirely imo
Jed,also some parts of his kit are just crazy overtuned
Jed,like down gun
Jed,I mean really you just gotta change how arsene and down gun work
Jed,and side b doing like 17
Jed,and his arsene moves having hitboxes the size of bowser
Jed,but yea arsene coming from taking damage makes no sense
Jed,and hitting him with arsene should make it go away very quickly
Jed,"I'd say just make it so that if he eats a certain number of attacks he just loses arsense automatically, so if you hit him with like four moves (not four hits, four moves) he's back to normal"
Jed,or just like
Jed,yea
Jed,make him more in line with the game he's from
Jed,and just have arsene for his specials
Jed,and his normals are his normals
Jed,or maybe 25 damage and arsene goes away
Jed,he'd still be really good but not as dumb
Jed,but he gets arsene by dealing 30 damage
Jed,or make it time based idk
Jed,or go the p4a route of if you hit him with arsene out enough times he just has no arsene for the whole stock
Jed,meh characters changing based on stock stuff like that is kinda dumb imo
Jed,eh maybe
Jed,like lucario
Jed,or krool
Jed,krool?
Jed,his belly can break
Jed,oh right
Jed,or wonderwing
Jed,but banjo is just lame tho
Jed,also I gotta say I hate that arsene is such a bad mechanic because the visual design for arsene is so damn cool
Jed,but in smash it's such an anti-fun mechanic
Jed,and also you can barely see him
Jed,it really be tho
Jed,zack why dont you play joker
Jed,cause he's not all that fun imo
Jed,I don't like having to rely on arsene or tricky setups for my kills
Jed,I really wanted to like him
Jed,Only big losers play joker
Jed,Wrong
Jed,Only big winners play joker
Jed,Also
Jed,Only cuties
Jed,
Jed,whens kameron 5
Jed,soon
Jed,brother
Jed,"Zack: 15
Kameron: 8"
Jed,@SWIRL GIRL @Bitmin @Mr. Airplane csgo
Jed,yes
Jed,10 minutes
Jed,then me and matt play
Jed,@Cs:go need 1 more
Jed,i can come in 10
Jed,Paradise Lost might be up there as one of the works books I've ever been forced to read
Jed,By Milton?
Jed,No the other paradise lost
Jed,They buffed incineroar's neutral b a bunch 
Jed,Spin move time
Jed,Spin move!
Jed,patch notes?
Jed,also WHY did they buff incineroar neutral b
Jed,move's already mad good
Jed,Also Terry is out already
Jed,We play later tonight lads @Ultimate
Jed,Time to pick up another character
Jed,lol they buffed incineroar neutral b... third hit
Jed,just specifically the third hit
Jed,of like five
Jed,They buffed the rest of the move too keep reading
Jed,(oh wait that was jabs I'm dumb)
Jed,that is a big yikes
Jed,and revenge lasts longer and has less end lag
Jed,fair got a bit nerfed though? hard to tell
Jed,either they added a weak hitbox or they really extended the weak hitbox I can't tell
Jed,Terry appearantly is kinda nice
Jed,No Palu nerfs
Jed,I'm satisfied
Jed,I'm definitely a little upset they buffed Incineroar though
Jed,I mean he doesn't have any new goofy stuff
Jed,just some of his old goofy stuff is better
Jed,I still don't think it's enough for me to solo main him
Jed,"(also, probably won't immediately be joining ultimate stuff tonight, some of my housemates who play traditional fighters want to learn, and also I'm gonna be learning some soul caliber, so I probably won't be around until pretty late)"
Jed,I have a test tomorrow so I will be trying Terry offline for like 5 minutes but won't be here to play online games.
Jed,
Jed,just study now and we can play later
Jed,I have to go to class now
Jed,I just woke up
Jed,
Jed,oh dear terry has double quarter circle inputs
Jed,and also what appears to be ghetto qc back half circle forwards
Jed,this is what we get for KoF characters
Jed,Kinda hype for Terry not gonna lie
Jed,@Ultimate fite me
Jed,I'll play for 30 minutes

Jed,"""Let's say you want to play poker. Let's say, hypothetically, you want to get a group of friends and play poker. Ok, and if you did play with friends, you would want to play with the homies right? Then hypothetically speaking, there would be a frostbite poker night. Now, let's say its tonight.

Now that we have established that there will be a poker night and the homies are invited, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that it would be fun. Am I not correct? A group of the homies deserves poker night, so I suggest that we play poker."""

Jed,I had such a lucky bracket lol
Jed,able dq'd?
Jed,"able DQ'd, and while I've brought him to last hit both times I've fought him he's always won, then Lungs upset Boo who I probably would have lost to again"
Jed,and then dog was playing luigi instead of his usual sheik
Jed,and his usual sheik fucks me up
Jed,made $10.50 from a $2 entry fee
Jed,did not cover the cost of entering two brackets and buying a giant burrito

Jed,
Jed,
Jed,"Got 33rd (3-2) at an ultimate regional, which I'm okay with given that both players I lost to finished 7th. I couldn't plausibly have done better given my seeding and I feel like I played pretty well. Also I made another campy player really mad about Incineroar which is always nice. Didn't even need revenge, just knowing that a) dash attack picks up banana and you're diddy so I don't care about the tiny punish you might get from that, b) while holding banana I still have access to sideb, lariat, and upb, and c) banana -> sideb is a thing Incineroar can do."

Jed,Good one
Jed,"“I don’t think I’ll have kids”
- Boring
- Invites argument

“My bloodline dies with me”
- Assertive
- Metal as fuck
- Implies you’re taking on a great noble burden which allows no arguments"
Jed,ty devon very cool
Jed,Me and Joan were discussing antinatalism and my 7 month pregnant boss walked in
Jed,I’ll keep y’all posted if I still have a job next week
Jed,Antinatalism is super toxic
Jed,It's up there with the death acceptance movement as one of my least favorite philosophical positions.
Jed,"Holdup why is the death acceptance movement one of your least favourite positions, I’m genuinely trying to find anything somebody could object to about it"
Jed,I have no idea why anyone would want to die given the alternative.
Jed,Suffering?
Jed,Eternal life is the ultimate goal of all medical research. Death and aging cause so much suffering that to end it would be a triumph unparalleled for all time.
Jed,Death acceptance is not a debate on medical suicide if that's what you were thinking
Jed,It means opposing eternal life
Jed,If that’s your stance then I don’t see how you can be antinatalism if you think living forever is the end goal then obv once we can live forever we need to stop having kids
Jed,No
Jed,We need to expand to other planets
Jed,So I understand the death acceptance movement and given the opportunity to have eternal life I would decline
Jed,There’s no point in living without dying imo
Jed,That is so contrary to my own belief I cannot comprehend why anyone would ever think that.
Jed,Eternal life is cool but if eternal life means an eternity of floating in the middle of space aimlessly while i lose my mind id rather not
Jed,"Would you ask the grim reaper to bring you blindness, weakness, ugliness, and an end to your relatives and yourself if he were a real entity. Why not just ask for nothing and lead a more enjoyable existence."
Jed,Eternal life doesn't mean you literally exist until the end of the universe
Jed,@Rotomotorz
Jed,"Watch CGP Grey's video ""why die"" for a great overview of my position"
Jed,?
Jed,Floating in the middle of space aimlessly
Jed,i.e.
Jed,just you floating in space
Jed,no ground for you to stand on
Jed,no like in a shuttle
Jed,not literally just you
Jed,The concept of one day you will die gives life more purpose and meaning IMO
Jed,"Also  @Max , does your idea of eternal life also include eternal youth?"
Jed,Yes of course. The research of the two go hand in hand.
Jed,"Okay, that's what I thought"
Jed,One will be a natural result of the other
Jed,But I wanted to make sure
Jed,"Also @Eric Working From Home , you will still eventually die"
Jed,In your uptown world is capitalism abolished or are human wage slaves for eternity
Jed,It's just about delaying that for as long as possible
Jed,Would you beat your child to make the days you don't beat him more enjoyable?
Jed,Utopian**
Jed,@Max that is so far from the point it’s mind boggling
Jed,Death giving life meaning is analogous to what I said
Jed,wait yeah thats definitely not analogous
Jed,I mean it bigly ain’t
Jed,If you think so then you don't understand my position
Jed,The concept of dying means your days are numbered and gives motivation to enjoy you days as you can
Jed,If you could live forever you’d have no motivation to accomplish anything
Jed,Maybe if you are lazy
Jed,I think it would lead to even greater progress since humans would never have to reset their knowledge pool
Jed,what gives people motivation during endless life
Jed,tho
Jed,Life is meaning in itself
Jed,I guess if you don't share that position none of my others make any sense
Jed,I have to go to class now
Jed,Perhaps but what do you plan to do with the people who view otherwise
Jed,Let them die obviously
Jed,so then endless life is a choice?
Jed,Why wouldn't it be
Jed,or is it given to only select individuals
Jed,And if its a choice what do you do with those of no ambition that choose to live forever
Jed,Not many people instictively wabt to die
Jed,People should have the option of death should they choose
Jed,I can consent to dying I couldn’t consent to being born
Jed,Like what if everybody all stopped having kids and humanity just lived in this utopian society until we all eventually died out and then the earth can try again in 1000000 years once primates evolve to our level
Jed,That’s the dream right there baby
Jed,Why would we not want ourselves to evolve?
Jed,Why would we want to end as homo sapiens?
Jed,When we could become homo superior?
Jed,What you propose is literally the opposite of what life tries to do
Jed,Life doesn’t take ethics and morality into account
Jed,Life doesn’t care if it’s ethically and morally wrong to have a child
Jed,I don't think it needs to
Jed,It just wants you to procreate and die
Jed,It supercedes all things
Jed,ethics and morality are mere concepts that we as humans have come up with
Jed,Life is a concept not an entity
Jed,Aren’t ethics and morality what we view and making us different and superior to non sentient races
Jed,Living != surviving
Jed,Life doesn't need to be an entity to supercede other concepts
Jed,If you are of the opinion that we should be slaves to the machinations of life then why oppose death
Jed,One merely exists because of the other
Jed,I also don't understand how procreation would be ethically or morally wrong
Jed,"A child can’t consent to being born, a child is burdened by the implications of society without being given a choose and inversely society is burdened by another person to cause damage to others and the world"
Jed,If you want a kid then adopt one
Jed,"There’s only three reasons to birth a child: ignorance, narcissism or both."
Jed,"That is a pretty narrow statement though, don't you think?"
Jed,What about that is narrow
Jed,Just because something cannot consent to being born doesn't mean that it is unhappy because it was
Jed,Also
Jed,It only takes into account the morality and ethics side of life
Jed,"We don’t owe life, it will persist regardless of our actions so why should we slave to it"
Jed,Why shouldn't I owe life? It allows me to exist and be who I am today. Passing on my own genes doesn't mean that I am a slave to life
Jed,So you want to have children to pass on your genes
Jed,It also gives others the chance to experience what life has to offer
Jed,I realize that this could be interpreted as your both statement
Jed,but so what?
Jed,Why don’t we just agree to disagree then cause it seems we are at an impasse
Jed,
Jed,This is 100% topic
Jed,But
Jed,I just got my schedule for next term
Jed,"and again, I only got 3 of the classes that I enrolled for"
Jed,Bruh hunt down the guy making the schedules
Jed,That’s bogus
Jed,So I went to look at all the class schedules
Jed,To see what was causing the conflict
Jed,and
Jed,There isn't any
Jed,There is literally no conflict
Jed,I didn't get put into these classes for reasons unknown
Jed,These classes are still open by the way
Jed,And they are also only available during winter

Jed,"also, at the tourney today we ran doubles, I ended up teaming in melee with a guy who's not all that good (generally goes 1-2 or 2-2, has no PR wins for the season) on the semi-arbitrary recommendation of dayman and we ended up going pretty hard - beat a team of #3 in the city and a guy around my level, and we were the only team to take a game off the team that won

we placed third, which doesn't seem all that impressive given that there were only 5 teams, but we crushed a team with players around the same levels, and beat a team we had absolutely no right to even get a game from"
Jed,@Homies quick bitta games or naw
Jed,we had shockingly good synergy
Jed,and I feel like if we practice we'll be an actual serious dubs threat
Jed,Aw fuck mate I’d love for a spot of games ping me if ya end up playing a not smash or csgo game

Jed,snow 
Jed,i hate snow

Jed,Is this the old or new testament?
Jed,new
Jed,also the whole chunk that part is from is basically throwing shade at jews
Jed,"which is really funny because it frequently calls them hypocrites but I sure haven't heard of anyone, no matter how devout, tear out an eye because they saw someone attractive"
Jed,Yo but if every dude alive nutted at the same time
Jed,what would happen?
Jed,
Jed,A lot of teachers would be fired
Jed,no but like
Jed,if all dudes were on a rocket ship
Jed,and were facing dick down
Jed,could the nutt blast get you to orbit?
Jed,OR better yet
Jed,If they were facing dick up
Jed,Could they de orbit earth? 
Jed,unlikely
Jed,since each man's nut would have to propel their own body weight
Jed,and adding more people would just make that less efficient

Jed,I'm probably gonna play through before the storm then do life is strange again and then do the 2nd
Jed,Man now I'm excited for the last episode but I have an essay to write
Jed,wanna trade essays
Jed,and then neither of us do them and instead we play life is strange together?

Jed,my statuses were just my name and numbers
Jed,"A closed room is a concept used in mystery fiction. An example would be a room with a corpse and the only key to that room in the pocket of the dead person, giving the impression that the crime was not possible to commit."
Jed,I've been reading mystery fiction for the last few months and closed rooms have come up a lot.
Jed,I'm gonna bother you to play danganronpa again

Jed,Does Danganronpa have closed rooms?

Jed,you can't dodge closed rooms
Jed,stfu i was planning on playing them soon
Jed,ruining everything
Jed,look my dude
Jed,STFU
Jed,saying there's a lot of murder in danganronpa is like saying there's a lot of cowboys in red dead redemption
Jed,it's literally the premise
Jed,LOL
Jed,you're reminding me i need to play it too
Jed,wonder if i can pirate it somehow 
Jed,I can literally send you the rom
Jed,right now
Jed,woa h
Jed,i feel bad pirating games tho
Jed,i should just buy it
Jed,aight here's what I'd say
Jed,if you're not sure if you're gonna like it
Jed,"pirate it, play the first two trials then make up your mind"
Jed,"and then you can decide to stop, or buy it, or do what I did and finish the first game but buy the other two"

Jed,where did you even get that from???
Jed,i've never heard it described like that in my life
Jed,"weebs tend to be more of an ""american style"" shitpost version of otaku"
Jed,meanwhile otakus originate from the mainland itself

Jed,?????
Jed,bruh
Jed,i ain't heard the word otaku in YEARS
Jed,idk where you're getting your info from
Jed,Gigguk
Jed,he said that?
Jed,weeb and otaku are interchangeable words
Jed,but there is a diffrence in which one is called
Jed,and percived

Jed,
Jed,^
Jed,saying youre an otaku is tbh more cringe than saying you're a weeb
Jed,cause atleast you arent in denail if you admit to being a weeb
Jed,there's a real dictionary deffiniton of otaku and not weeb
Jed,Well i just tried to kill myself
Jed,i'm genuinely unsure if you guys know the difference.
Jed,if you use a non english term to describe how much of an anime fan you are then you're a weeb
Jed,"weeb, ottaku who cards they both cringe"
Jed,you're all gay
Jed,problem solved
Jed,
Jed,^
Jed,so basically according to that video: Otakus don't exist in the west
Jed,checkmate
Jed,the weeb vs weeaboo thing seems to be true
Jed,"basically otaku is just a cringe-y, outdated term that people in the west don't really say anymore"
Jed,literally no one cares
Jed,im just saying rainbowpixel is wrONG
Jed,and im the more cultured weeb here
Jed,
Jed,Seems to fit
Jed,no ?
Jed,I mean what you just said now
Jed,compare your message with his definition
Jed,i never defined weeb
Jed,"all it means is someone who likes anime, that's literally it"
Jed,"""I'm the more cultured weeb here"" is what I was referring to"
Jed,don't you guys live in the same house?

Jed,"I will hopefully be able to do that as well. Its doubtful that I'll have the time though, since I will be taking calc 2 when it comes out. My math professors have said to not expect much free time when taking calc 2."
Jed,I've looked over some of the stuff for integration
Jed,It seems conceptually easier than differential
Jed,That is so wrong
Jed,"But the ""shutup and calculate"" bits seem hard"
Jed,
Jed,Taking derivatives is pretty easy once you understand all the rules
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,Is my second comment correct?
Jed,I mean
Jed,It's just plug and chug really
Jed,But the equations can get complicated
Jed,so you have to be careful
Jed,What do you mean by shutup and calculate?
Jed,Definite integrals
Jed,You mean using the fundamental theorem?
Jed,I don't think so
Jed,Definite integrals are the ones where you have limits of integration right?
Jed,Definite integrals have a defined boundary
Jed,yes
Jed,Shutup and calculate is just another way of saying plug and chug
Jed,When you have found the antiderivative of a given function
Jed,and you want to calculate with the given boundary
Jed,To solve those what I've been doing is integrating and then plugging the 2 limits into the new equation and subtracting one from the other.
Jed,"It comes from physics land where students get to philosophical about what equations mean so the teachers shout ""SHUTUP AND CALCULATE!"""
Jed,@Max is your school trimesters or semesters?
Jed,semesters
Jed,Ahh
Jed,That's why you covered integration in calc 1
Jed,We have 3 calc courses 
Jed,So should Max
Jed,I mean my school does have calc 3
Jed,but I don't need to take it
Jed,Calc 3 is multivariable calculus
Jed,Chemistry majors only need up to calc 2
Jed,TBH now I'm confused and am not sure which calculi are available at my uni

Jed,candy tier list
Jed,"Airheads God Tier, KitKat God tier, Reese dropped to very solid, Candy Cigarette dropped to suck"
Jed,How the fuck are airheads god tier
Jed,Airheads actually a tier above god tier
Jed,Not just saying this to fuck with you guys
Jed,This tier list is garbage
Jed,Airheads are #1 candy
Jed,Puts hot tamales in the pixie sticks tier this doesn’t even make any sense
Jed,They suck just as much as pixie sticks
Jed,I can understand why you disagree that it’s god tier but I’m genuinely baffled why airheads is rated as a low tier candy
Jed,LAFFY TAFFY IS GOOD
Jed,Unless you’re ranking it low cause like “oh it’s sticky if you hold it”
Jed,WAY BETTER THAN AIRHEADS
Jed,SMH
Jed,Airheads taste good
Jed,they aight
Jed,this is the worst tiers list of all time
Jed,Clearly the people who made this tier list had no hard candy proponents on their board of directors
Jed,How biased
Jed,How discriminatory
Jed,how are dots and health very solid ???
Jed,calling HR
Jed,those are both pretty nasty
Jed,There wasn't much hard candy here anyways
Jed,Also laffy taffy and airheads suck
Jed,settle this like civilized men and women
Jed,fight to the death
Jed,You have to put way too much effort into eating them for very little payoff
Jed,LAFFY TAFFY TASTES SUPER GOOD WYM
Jed,and theyre not hard to eat at all
Jed,im boutta throw hands
Jed,Throw them
Jed,also fun dip is great dont @ me
Jed,bro square up
Jed,I'm squared up
Jed,
Jed,yea maybe fun dip and laffy taffy are good if you like to suffer
Jed,Laffy Taffy better than airheads no cap
Jed,they both trash
Jed,No
Jed,they just sugar
Jed,if i wanna eat sugar
Jed,i would just eat sugar
Jed,They solid at lowest
Jed,yea
Jed,solidly in the lowest tier
Jed,Reese's overrated
Jed,that's patently false
Jed,No
Jed,@Mr. Airplane
Jed,Holy shit this is so bad
Jed,How the fuck are pixie sticks in c
Jed,Fun dip in b
Jed,Holy shit
Jed,sorry that you're wrong
Jed,EDIT: updated tier names adn dropped jawbreakers down a tier cause idk why i had them as high as they were
Jed,Verified Baby 
Jed,For what
Jed,https://www.speedrun.com/tabletop_simulator/full_game
Jed,speedrun.com
Jed,"Speedrunning leaderboards, resources, forums, and more!"
Jed,This is the greatest disservice I have ever seen for left handed people
Jed,We only get the left armrest
Jed,Everyone else has two except for the poor right handed person beside me
Jed,wouldn't that make it good for left handed people?
Jed,yea wait hold up
Jed,“””technically””” in the best (worst?) case where all seats are filled everyone else also only gets one armrest since you ain’t putting ur arm on someone else’s
Jed,otherwise you get below average armrests
Jed,oh snap it's elvin
Jed,just sit in one of hte center seats if you want two armrests so bad
Jed,the god
Jed,alvin
Jed,my favourite chipmunk
Jed,dab
Jed,also @Eric Working From Home ur candy tier list is high key awful
Jed,"your argument that ""its just sugar so why wouldnt i jsut eat sugar"" is the dumbest thing ive ever heard"
Jed,okay that was a joke
Jed,but actually
Jed,pixie sticks
Jed,are just sugar in a paper tube
Jed,crutches at school is not the move
Jed,there is no appeal to that whatsoever
Jed,also what jed said that too
Jed,thats why they C tier
Jed,"pixie sticks have no flavor, they are messy, and they make you want to die after eating them"
Jed,you put reese way too high
Jed,ok they arent messy
Jed,if you make a mess with them you're big dubm
Jed,reeses are clearly the best candy
Jed,what if you wanted to die before eating them
Jed,You literally can't eat them
Jed,If they get any moisture in them whatsoever
Jed,im convinced you two are disabled
Jed,It's game over
Jed,^
Jed,dont spit into the tube then??????
Jed,???
Jed,You have to put the tube to your mouth to eat it
Jed,you guys are also way too hung up on the pixie sticks i put them into C tier you monkeys
Jed,It's inevitable
Jed,oml how do you function
Jed,you turn the tube over nd pour it onto ur tongue
Jed,"Plus, even if you do get anything out of them"
Jed,like you dont suck the shit outta a tube
Jed,They don't even taste good
Jed,the only candy that i would consider being worse than pixie sticks is hot tamales
Jed,i put them C tier i dont know why you're so hung up on them
Jed,its not like i put them in A tier
Jed,In
Jed,What
Jed,World
Jed,Are they better than
Jed,Resses pieces
Jed,??????????????????
Jed,"hot tomales are like someone took mike and ikes and went ""yea these are incredibly disappointing, but i think we could make them worse"""
Jed,cause reeses pieces are big 
Jed,its like skittles meets the bad part of reeses
Jed,Ok
Jed,I just saw that you put York peppermint patties below them
Jed,Your opinion on candy is so bad
Jed,the fact that the bottom tier contained spicy candy is the only thing that saved yorks from bottom tier
Jed,yorks are actually
Jed,so
Jed,fucking
Jed,bad
Jed,you know what
Jed,i'd put them on the same level of hot tamales
Jed,york peppermint patties are the most vile disgusting shit in hte world
Jed,like peppermint marshmallow
Jed,what the fuck
Jed,youn know what fuck hot tamales im putting york patties in hte bottom tier
Jed,Looking more into your tier list
Jed,"bruh i dunno how i can trust anyone's opinion who puts CRUNCH above REECES, TWIX, HEATH, and SNICKERS"
Jed,You have fundip above twix
Jed,And twizzlers
Jed,that might be the worst take in this whole list
Jed,"hot take, twix bigly not good"
Jed,twix kinda meh
Jed,crunch is the worst chocolate bar free
Jed,Also
Jed,Skittles below fundip
Jed,no
Jed,What planet are you on?
Jed,twix is a crunchy flavourless cookie pretending to be a chocolate bar by adding in infinitesimal amounts fo chocolate and caramel
Jed,crunch is good
Jed,idk whats wrong with you
Jed,crunch is the kinda chocolate bar that you eat when you have given up on enjoying chocolate bars
Jed,chris the kinda guy with such shit taste in candy he puts this stuff in S tier
Jed,crunch is literally just a milk chocolate bar with crunchy pieces
Jed,idk what you find wrong with it
Jed,yes
Jed,you guys also thuroughly did not give milk duds enough credit
Jed,like unless you're lowering its rank cause its like cement for your teeth
Jed,cause if you your list loses all credit then
Jed,that is exactly why we put it lower
Jed,you guys are goons
Jed,also it snowing outside widepeepohappy
Jed,we're not ranking how fucking ergonomic the candy is
Jed,that is part of the consumption pprocess
Jed,we ranking how good it tastes
Jed,you moron
Jed,you fool
Jed,yall are some fucking reeses shills might I add
Jed,when trick or treating I wouldn't even trade my reeses pieces for anything I'd literally give that shit away
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,i should've known Chris' Cnady tier list would be shit cause of that time when he asked what candy i wanted i said gummies and this MF got Sour Cola Bottle Gummies
Jed,not even normal ones
Jed,fucking
Jed,sour
Jed,cola
Jed,bottle
Jed,gummies

Jed,@Matt  i got 11 lights
Jed,9 regular and lux
Jed,Just got back from a reddit event at the board game café. It was pretty fun. 
Jed,what does that mean
Jed,It means people in the Houston board games subreddit said that there would be a lot of people there that day and they invited others to come join them. The store even gave a discount if you mentioned the subreddit.
Jed,nice
Jed,
Jed,I will be distancing myself from the other Zacks after discovering what shit taste they have
Jed,Literally
Jed,cereal
Jed,
Jed,This cereal tier list is pretty good
Jed,yeah
Jed,Much better than the candy one
Jed,we made it with group think
Jed,that's why kamerons bad opinions didn't make it to light
Jed,
Jed,fuuuuck the internet historian just released an hour long video
Jed,but I need to write an essy
Jed,oops
Jed,N O M A N S S K Y
Jed,whatabouttit
Jed,Internet historians video is about that
Jed,"Corn flakes isnt an ""organic"" ceral tf?"
Jed,
Jed,well it is tasteless
Jed,"Also the ""organic"" tier was a meme"
Jed,ah like my meatloaf ingredient tier
Jed,but also i heard feeding people grape nuts is banned by hte geneva convention
Jed,"and @Rotomotorz corn flakes are tasteless to stop masturbation, its by design"
Jed,
Jed,god yall so uneducated
Jed,"It might just be that your distaste for corn flakes is not by accident though, as Mr Kellogg actually developed cornflakes primarily to stop children from masturbating!  He had particular ideas about masturbation, writing, “if illicit commerce of the sexes is a heinous sin, self-pollution is a crime doubly abominable.” He felt that certain foods inspired ‘self-pollution’, like spicy foods,  meat, and generally anything that tasted too good. One of the biggest fights he had with his brother, and business partner, was over adding sugar to cornflakes. Kellogg’s brother had the (right) idea that sugar would vastly improve the taste of the cereal, but Kellogg stood by his original vision, that of plain and boring, sexual desire killing food, so the flakes remained unsweetened."
Jed,also hot take
Jed,french topast crunch
Jed,not that good
Jed,That's the hottest take
Jed,Because it is so wrong
Jed,undeniably worse that cinnamon toast crunch at the very least
Jed,atleast the latter has flavour
Jed,wait this corn flake story is hilarious
Jed,kellogg is actually stupid
Jed,well he became very rich and thne very dead
Jed,@Eric Working From Home your list is bad
Jed,My list may be bad but I stand by French toast crunch being at most B tier material
Jed,gamers
Jed,non-gamers
Jed,D:
Jed,daheck the iceborn monster hunter dlc is $40
Jed,It's a whole new storyline with a bunch of new monsters and more
Jed,New area aswell
Jed,so like
Jed,1/5th of a game
Jed,theres like 12 new monsters
Jed,31 total
Jed,so like 2/5th of a game
Jed,get it right
Jed,
Jed,Joined the server.
Jed,yo i told you guys french toast cruch was top teir
Jed,it really aint tho
Jed,"cheap, tasty, affordable for a broke student living by the paycheck ."
Jed,
Jed,the community consistently ranks it B-C tier
Jed,lucky charms is too sweet.
Jed,it is cheap and affordable
Jed,honey nuts is s
Jed,but it is flavourless
Jed,It's literally not flavourless though
Jed,Like what
Jed,naw. you can taste the honey
Jed,that's what makes it good
Jed,Do you have a tounge?
Jed,must've had a bad box at your place then during meetup
Jed,also life is really good too
Jed,cause it was like flavourless cardboard cubes
Jed,frosted flakes is also way too sweet
Jed,nah forsted flakes S tier
Jed,yeah
Jed,cheerios is tasteless
Jed,you're saying everything is too sweet
Jed,i think maybe you just like mild flavours
Jed,either tasteless or too sweet
Jed,maybe thast why you like french toast crunch
Jed,bruh. i never said frootloops was too sweet
Jed,frootloops is S
Jed,that we can agree on
Jed,high A
Jed,jsut cause hte basis for S tier is frosted flakes
Jed,if we put frootloops in S we gotta make a new tier above S
Jed,frosted flakes becomes so spongey after like 30 seconds
Jed,yeah thats the best way to eat cereal
Jed,leave it in hte milk for like 1 minute so its no longer crunchy
Jed,thats my second hot take of the day
Jed,no
Jed,This is why we ignore your opinions
Jed,no. crunchy cereal with the slight taste of milk is the best
Jed,so you're rather have mini wheats like right as you put the milk in when the inside is still fully dry
Jed,we fuck mini wheats
Jed,rather than let the milk permeate it
Jed,kuz it's disgusting
Jed,this fucker eats his mini wheats dry
Jed,
Jed,mini wheats is disgusting
Jed,wtfd
Jed,benson your taste in cereal is so shit
Jed,at least i have a tongue kuz i can actually taste the honey in the honey nut
Jed,im aware theres honey in honey nut
Jed,i jsut still do not enjoy it
Jed,also. more people here prefer crunchy cereal here.
Jed,im no longer on hte milky vs Dry cereal debate
Jed,mini wheats are good
Jed,they sweetness doesn't go well with the milk. if you're unfortunate enough to have 3% it tastes even worse. at that point you're eating cream with laxities.
Jed,im like 90% sure your tastebuds jsut finna dont work
Jed,you out here saying everyhitng too sweet
Jed,if it has even a semblance of flavour
Jed,i'm probably more sensitive to sweetness than you are. also not everything is too sweet. plus i never said mini wheats was too sweet.
Jed,
Jed,ok maybe that i coulda worded that better
Jed,mini wheats tastes like frosting. which doesnt go well with milk. it's like mixing mint and chocolate
Jed,bruh
Jed,you ever heard of mint chocolate chip
Jed,or andes mints
Jed,i have. but mint seems to ruin chocolate for me
Jed,I think your taste buds are broke
Jed,this guys taste buds def broke as hell
Jed,does cilantro taste slightly like mint to anyone here?
Jed,shit tastes like soap
Jed,soap* i meant soap
Jed,link the teirlist website
Jed,for cereal
Jed,nvm found it
Jed,
Jed,lucky charms i used to like.
Jed,but i cant eat it anymore.
Jed,krave is probably my favourite
Jed,and if the nesquick cereal was here it'd go in A teir
Jed,wrong
Jed,so wrong
Jed,i really like my milk.
Jed,if i'm gunna eat frosted flakes i'm gunna dump my milk with my unsweetend dark roast coffee
Jed,"bruh honey nut cheerios definitely ""ruins the milk"""
Jed,i see your point. but it's not as bad as frosted flakes
Jed,benson you put raisin bran over corn flakes
Jed,you opinion literally has negative validity
Jed,Devon you don't get to speak
Jed,actually shut up chris your shit taste extends beyond cereals
Jed,atleast benson kept his terrible taste localized to cereal
Jed,
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,easy as fuck dude
Jed,all we needed was one less chris

Jed,
Jed,time to bring stacks of cash watch out
Jed,fearless ideas now that's a class i wanna take when i come up with ideas the amount of fear that comes along with them is just simply overwhelming. What a visionary but seriously though Kameron do you need to bring something or is it optional. If it's not optional then bring something that you think is cool and come up with a way in witch it effected you.
Jed,lol
Jed,fearless ideas is like an ad campaign for the umd campus
Jed,"social activity, e.g. G A M I N G"

Jed,10 mins
Jed,How's the novel coming along
Jed,"@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home Just played another game of Agricola, this time with the revised version (the one we played was the original), and thought you might want to hear my thoughts. 
1. The revised version is definitely an improvement upon the original. Everyone at the table had useful cards to play and some decent synergies; card quality just felt higher overall.
2. I think revised version + draft would be even better, as to allow for even better card synergies.
3. Restocking the spaces in the physical version is way less tedious than in TTS (not much we can do about that though).
4. Having a plan for food and getting it setup before the first harvest is VERY important, as having to waste actions on food later is painful when better action cards flip.
5. Overly focusing on one thing is bad. One player went totally in on the farming strategy and ended the game with 11 grain and 7 vegetables (max scoring is at 8 grain and 4 vegetables). While this is impressive, all the excess crops didn't help in the score department and this player didn't win.
6. I overall had a lot of fun and think we shouldn't give up on this game if we can find a way to use the revised edition cards."

Jed,yeah but I still have a small amount of hope
Jed,and if nothing else it's visually amazing
Jed,"and from talking to people who know more about the current guilty gear and more from people who've played the demo of the new one, it's still looking like a solid game, just not really in the same vein as the previous ones (apparently this one is just gonna be ""better street fighter"" if it continues in its current state)"

Jed,"How long after being locked in a grocery store would it take you to steal food to eat, with the assumption that you eventually be let out of the grocery store"
Jed,Wouldn't it make sense to eat as soon as you got hungry and just pay for it when they come back
Jed,you have no money
Jed,when you got locked in the store someone took your wallet aswell
Jed,then whats he doing there
Jed,are you dumb
Jed,I would eat once I was hungry. There is no way they could charge me for a crime if they locked me in. I would win.
Jed,browsing
Jed,what are you winning
Jed, Cops are gone 
Jed,The court case
Jed,They would settle it with me. They would have serious bad press to worry about if they locked me in. They would probably pay me to keep my mouth shut and not care if I munched a few chips to keep myself alive.

Jed,They serve different purposes. AFK is where the server automatically moves you to if you show no activity. BRB is a place you move yourself with the intention of moving back later. The different titles allow those outside to know the status of those people and whether they should expect them to return.

Jed,Valve has confirmed that the new half life game will be totally linear with no open world aspects whatsoever. I'm super relieved that they decided to stick with the classic formula and not ruin it by  making it open world.

Jed,"Ike is too one dimensional, Bowser is pretty matchup dependent, and Toon Link isn't good enough."
Jed,Maybe I could give Pikachu another try.
Jed,just play ike he not bad
Jed,He was the character I kept coming back to
Jed,maybe
Jed,Ike + Bowser would be a fun duo
Jed,hey i like both of those characters
Jed,"Is that a ""back off"" type of message?"
Jed,no it was an encouraging message
Jed,as in
Jed,i can help you play both of those characters
Jed,true

Jed,Oakland is a really shitty city
Jed,First impression
Jed,Genesis boy pog
Jed,How was the flight?
Jed,I was gonna have nothing to do all morning but one of my friends was on my flight so we played friendlies for a few hours
Jed,Nice
Jed,It was super short it kinda felt like I didn't go anywhere
Jed,It was like an hour and a half
Jed,Yea that's not too long
Jed,It would've taken like 10 hours to drive tho
Jed,Yeah
Jed,Short flights always feel weird cause the check-in and waiting for the plane always takes longer than the flight itself
Jed,Yeah
Jed,We had a bunch of smash players I know on the flight
Jed,Fat Goku sat like 2 seats away from me
Jed,That's sick
Jed,Who did you play friendlies with
Jed,Also I'm mega bored just waiting for my ENT
Jed,Just sitting in a room
Jed,My boy culex

Jed,Did you have a fucking stroke there buddy?
Jed,was laying on the floor and reached up to try and type games
Jed,i heard oakland is kinda ghetto
Jed,Just found a steaming shit at work
Jed,On the floor
Jed,
Jed,??
Jed,What the fuck
Jed,
Jed,I am never using one of the restrooms by the foundry ever again
Jed,These people are ANIMALS
Jed,Bruh who does that in the space x IBM apple Lockheed Martin Uber office headquarters
Jed,You forgot Google aswell
Jed,No I didn't
Jed,i cant believe berkshire hathaway would hire someone who does that
Jed,also yes Oakland is pretty ghetto be careful
Jed,it's like 90% very sketchy and after the first time I went there I decided it'd be the bright move to just uber both in and out
Jed,also like two people were murdered there in the four months I was nearby
Jed,Yeah I'm not planning on being anywhere other than the bnb and venue after today
Jed,You forgot Amazon and Netflix
Jed,i heard there was a round 1 near there
Jed,@Jed when you game?

Jed,@solarlight come
Jed,ok
Jed,did someone say furry owo
Jed,Did someone say furry 
Jed,
Jed,The Aussie player I'm seeded to play is fucking good
Jed,But he's in my bnb and I'm getting the download
Jed,stream it
Jed,"Just played some more agricola, this time with the school board game club. Really enjoying the game."
Jed,board game club 
Jed,More like
Jed,Board game club 
Jed,Lmao my sponsor really out here dropping me the morning of genesis
Jed,Oof
Jed,Place higher than 16th and show them who they shouldnt have dropped
Jed,It's only cause I called him out about getting the money he said I'd get in October
Jed,Hmm that sounds illegal on their part
Jed,I mean he said that atk doesn't deserve me and doesn't think I'm a good fit
Jed,Do you have email/message chains?
Jed,Well he sent me the money today
Jed,Aight that's not too bad then
Jed,But it still might be worth going public with provided that's not a breach of contract
Jed,"Yeah just kind of stupid that he'd just drop me with no discussion, I've literally been with the org for over a year now and joined at it's conception"
Jed,So here's the funny thing
Jed,"""They didn't pay me and when I gave them shit about it they fired me for 'not being a good fit'"" is kind of a huge red flag"
Jed,I never signed a contract so I can say whatever I want
Jed,"Like, wanting money from your sponsor is kinda how sponsors work"
Jed,I'd say don't go overboard but it's an important cautionary tale
Jed,Yeah I'm probably gonna tweet and just say that I've been let go and the circumstances behind it
Jed,Yaw
Jed,"Be honest, don't be overly vicious (don't want to alienate potential future sponsors), but also make it clear that there appears to be a correlation between wanting to be paid and not being a good fit"
Jed,Yeah
Jed,F. Sorry to hear that Jed
Jed,"It's okay, I was kind of thinking about it anyways cause I was getting really frustrated"
Jed,It took bemmie almost 5 months to get me the money
Jed,And I would ask kindly once a month
Jed,Until last month u started to show I was getting upset
Jed,Cause he keeps running all these tournaments with thousands of dollars on the line
Jed,How much money did you get anyways?
Jed,150 for one event
Jed,Which is better than what most rivals sponsorships do
Jed,also do they handle travel fees and stuff?
Jed,So it was a hella good deal and that's why I wanted to stay
Jed,They way that they did it was they reimbursed half my flight
Jed,But I had to buy the ticket and send them the reciept
Jed,are they still gonna reimburse your genesis travel?
Jed,I highly doubt it
Jed,We barely discussed it
Jed,"I said ""I assume genesis reimbursement is out of the question as I still haven't gotten the reimbursement from heatwave"""
Jed,yikes
Jed,That's a big F
Jed,"although now he has an excuse to be like ""yup not paying for genesis"""
Jed,"also that's probably something worth mentioning in your post ""so I flew out to genesis while still on the team and they're not gonna be paying my flight"""
Jed,Yeah I'm gonna write it up after I've thought about it
Jed,One of my now ex teammates is at genesis and I'm gonna try and find him
Jed,Not sure if this is real homies but stay safe

Jed,very dramatic
Jed,HE WAS SO CLOSE

Jed,I just saw an article by a veteran Terraforming Mars player that said building cities is one of the worst strategies in the game. I'm not sure how that could be given that my city spam in the second game we played seemed so effective.
Jed,I guess we never really understood how to play the game at all
Jed,Someday I'll probably try it again
Jed,"Now that I'm thinking about it more, I feel like I actually probably liked the game, but that feeling was overshadowed by the rather negative table atmosphere and how much everyone else seemed to be miserable."
Jed,"Logically, it has two of my favorite things in a game, drafting and engine building, so I should probably like it."
Jed,"I think that if I could be shown/show myself with more plays that the game has more viable strategies than city spam like that article claims, I could probably have fun playing the game."
Jed,@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home
Jed,"I don't remember who else played, but you know who you are and that you should have been tagged. (either Chris or Zack I think)"

Jed,hbox has really bad di
Jed,also marth puff on dreamland looks practically impossible
Jed,even tho zain is winning
Jed,he is just way better
Jed,Hbox is carried by puff
Jed,I feel like he's just gotten really complacent
Jed,he dragged puff up for years
Jed,but now that he's on top he's getting lazy
Jed,I would say he actually used to be carried by puff even more than now. See his skill with other characters over time as evidence.
Jed,his secondaries have always kinda sucked?
Jed,They are way better now
Jed,but in general I'd say he is the reason he's carried by puff
Jed,"not only is dreamland busted for puff, but it also kills the momentum of the other player"
Jed,like he made puff into a character who can carry
Jed,and then stopped pushing her as a character
Jed,and now he's letting his past work carry him
Jed,and now everyone's figuring out how to counter that
Jed,bro he literally never used the sing punish on marth until like last year
Jed,thats how little he innovates
Jed,"wow, one (1) new piece of tech"
Jed,naw it was evidence for your point moron
Jed,yeah I was agreeing
Jed,he stopped innovating after like 2017
Jed,hbox is honestly so lame
Jed,I would say that at that point in time he was carrying puff but now he's just letting puff carry him
Jed,the worst guy to be the best melee player
Jed,never plays friendlies
Jed,at least people are figuring him out
Jed,doesnt innovate or play to the meta
Jed,camps when he is losing
Jed,like I think unless he starts working hard again he's not holding onto #1 for another year
Jed,think about how unstoppable he looked in early 2019
Jed,and now he's got a whole bunch of frequent losses
Jed,look how much data he gets by playing games on dreamland
Jed,"zain, wizzy for a bit, hbox sometimes, especially leffen"
Jed,i dunno if winning a game on dreamland vs hbox is even a good idea
Jed,"Go Zain, saving melee"
Jed,"and he's got hax, leffen, fiction all chilling down there"
Jed,it'd be fairly insane if he even makes grands
Jed,dammit I want to make dinner but there's like no sets I don't want to watch
Jed,I guess I'll wait for hbox fiction
Jed,fuck which set is next
Jed,can I just leave during the ad break?
Jed,but it's probably gonna be leffen hax
Jed,smash gg says that leffen hax is next
Jed,darn
Jed,HAX$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Jed,tweet incoming 
Jed,THE ROOM WAS COLD
Jed,idk if the box should be leagl. in my opinion the set should be replayed?
Jed,I WAS DISTRACTED BY THE LIGHTING

5th ain't too bad to start my comeback off with I guess. We'll take it all things considered!"
Jed,SPAM  THIS  CRUSTACEAN  FOR  HBOX  ELIMINATION 
Jed,Hax is abusing puff's lackluster defense very well
Jed,HAX$ IS NUTS

Jed,welp
Jed,that was a choke and a half
Jed,We take those

Jed,"Beating the World’s Best at Super Smash Bros. Melee with Deep Reinforcement
Learning"
Jed,@solarlight
Jed,Andrew what is this?
Jed,
Jed,Can you read?
Jed,"One particularly clever player found that the simple strategy of crouching at the edge of the stage caused the network to behave very oddly, refusing to attack and eventually KOing itself by falling off the other side of the stage. One hypothesis to explain this weakness is the lack of diversity in training - since the network only played against old copies of itself, it never encountered such a degenerate strategy"
Jed,absolutely large brain
Jed,RIGHT
Jed,Its a cool paper
Jed,They actually released their training lab on github

Jed,What
Jed,?
Jed,so
Jed,fuck essays
Jed,True
Jed,Settle a debate https://www.strawpoll.me/19347040
Jed,THe is our high five phrase
Jed,"Vote Now! [Up high, down low fakes out high five too slow] [Up high, down low, in the middle fakes out high five too slow]"
Jed,It’s supposed to say the fake out not “the is our” autocorrect
Jed,Yo wait
Jed,who the fuck out here saying in the middle
Jed,Cause Ashley says you don’t say in the middle but I’m saying you gotta day in the middle so that you have proper rhyming sequence
Jed,Literally never met anybody why doesn’t do in the middle
Jed,Tf
Jed,Wait
Jed,Also Chris don’t vote I want to know what the general populace does and you have time and time again shown you don’t do a single normal thing
Jed,How does saying in the middle make it a rhyming sequence
Jed,It literally doesn't rhyme
Jed,"Cause it it goes 
Up high (not rhyming line)
Down low (setup for the rhyme)
In the middle (additional line to keep the rhymes on alternating lines)
Too slow (Rhyme Payoff)"
Jed,If you lead a single not rhyming line into two back to back rhyming lines it messes with the flow
Jed,I guess that makes sense
Jed,Listen to any song
Jed,Okay
Jed,I feel like your thing works better in text
Jed,I feel like it works better in practice aswell
Jed,Nah
Jed,Cause the rhyme part is tacked onto the middle line
Jed,So it doesn't feel like payoff for the down low line
Jed,you feel
Jed,The only additional payoff of not adding in the middle is that if you fake out the low high five it leaves their hand lingering in a downward instead of horizontal motion
Jed,You don’t need lay-off on every like
Jed,Payoff*
Jed,Line*
Jed,"Like example
Life is old there (spacing)
Older than the trees (setup)
Younger than the mountains (spacing)
Blowing like a breeze (payoff)"
Jed,There no payoff on the mountains line cause it’s added as spacing
Jed,I think the clear distinction here is that your example is a song while the high five action is not
Jed,bruh who be saying in the middle
Jed,You're trying to turn it into a song
Jed,probably dumb people
Jed,But it doesn't need to be
Jed,It’s not a song it’s a rhyme sequence though
Jed,Genuinely never met people who didn’t say in the middle until now tf
Jed,Well here's the thing with that
Jed,You mostly do this joke to kids
Jed,So your family probably played it on you using the middle version
Jed,You aren't exposed to how other people say it because the other people you are exposed to in your life probably realize that you are too old to fall for the joke
Jed,I feel like the desire for there to be patterns in the rhyming sequence is a natural thing not something you learn like why “tock tick” sounds worse than “tick tock” there’s an actual like psychological reason for that
Jed,Ergo you never meet anyone that would say it the other way
Jed,Idk about you bro but I still be pulling the fake out high fives to this day
Jed,That’s how we got onto this topic of discussion
Jed,in the middle breaks the rythymic sequence which imo sounds worse
Jed,though ive heard both
Jed,That just wrong tho
Jed,It doesn’t break the sequence the fuck?
Jed,I think it could be due to kids not picking up on the rhyme the way you propose it though
Jed,Not adding it breaks the sequence
Jed,It's more clear that the rhyme is intended when the middle portion is excluded
Jed,To kids at least
Jed,What dumbass kids are you dealing with
Jed,The fuck
Jed,"yeah ""up high"" ""down low"" and ""too slow"" are all two syllable"
Jed,If you play a kid country roads are they not gonna notice trees rhymes with breeze
Jed,"""in the middle"" is 4"
Jed,It’s the bridging line Greg
Jed,Cause I was doing it to Ashley and when I said “down low” she slapped my hand with the might of a thousand suns then was like “why didn’t you try and pull your hand away” and I was like cause I pull it away in the middle and that’s how we got here
Jed,That line is from way back I just had to keep deleting and refusing it cause Greg kept saying some@dumb shit that I had to respond to right away
Jed,Hence why it doesn’t make sense in the conversation
Jed,fwiw i’ve always heard it w/ “in the middle”

Jed,"You're my friend, and I care about my friends"
Jed,"I've barely spent any time with you, and I barely know you as well"
Jed,That doesn't mean that we aren't friends. We just don't know eachother that well is all

Jed,I'll do what I want.
Jed,god says eye contact before marriage is sin !!!
Jed,"and besides, not all the chapters in the SK one are NSFW. (I marked the ones that are, so for the people who don't want that stuff can steer clear)"
Jed,he does not...
Jed,ye i can see that
Jed,"everything else is just soft ecchi, if anything at all"

Jed,being gay isnt a meme

Jed,"you can't just fetishize lesbians and be like ""GAY MEN CAN GO BURN IN HECK"""
Jed,you dodnt know if im a girl though
Jed,"if it's just ""bros"" being ""bros"", no signs of gay any where, I'm cool with it"
Jed,frostbite said trans rights

Jed,@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home @Rotomotorz Just finished an in person game of Terra Mystica. I played the Fakirs to handicap myself but still got  133. Pretty happy with that score given how bad they are.
Jed,wow the coronavirus is really getting to max
Jed,I should have gotten 136 but I forgot to take water 1 for my sanctuary
Jed,
Jed,tragic
Jed,OH SHIT HES SO WIDE
Jed,network wide asf
Jed,"Carpet flight, earth 1, and dwelling round meant I scored 44 points in the last turn plus another 8 for passing with the sanctuary stronghold bonus card with both in play."
Jed,"On another note, I'm even more happy with the score when I consider I had both neighboring colors in play (which the Fakirs especially dislike)."
Jed,welp I got a new celeste PB but I'm real sad

Jed,Tragic
Jed,damn that sucks
Jed,Bro that’s fucked
Jed,hunt him down
Jed,How does one manage to hit the side of a car in a driveway
Jed,These are the people you share the road with everyday
Jed,"Could of been an animal, or some dude with a bat"
Jed,bro how an animal bouta do that
Jed,there aren't like bison walking around in florida
Jed,Humans are animals
Jed,
Jed,Human drive car
Jed,car hit car
Jed,i mena a deer could do that
Jed,^
Jed,That was my original idea
Jed,It looks all scratched up though at the bottom so it looks like it was acutally a car
Jed,how tf did that other car even get onto your driveway tbh
Jed,like wtf were they doing
Jed,the funniest thing about it is that I dont have a normal driveway
Jed,like my car was pretty far from the road
Jed,Draw a diagram
Jed,
Jed,Wow
Jed,That was really fast
Jed,and detailed
Jed,You should be an artist
Jed,but real talk I was sideways up by the door
Jed,and even then the road is a good couple feet behind me
Jed,Damn sucks dude
Jed,"Okay, theory time"
Jed,Some guy needed to turn around
Jed,so he pulls into your driveway to do it
Jed,hits your car
Jed,Theory time over
Jed,nah apparently people heard the guy speeding down the road and slamming into my car
Jed,but no one did anything

Jed,Who here has played the Steam version of UNO?
Jed,I wasn't even aware that there was a steam version of UNO. I've played it on tabletop simulator though.
Jed,"I think it's only like... $5-10...?
I've seen a few YouTubers play it and it actually looks kind fun."
Jed,It's got special rules you can enable... And different game settings with special cards.
Jed,"For example, 7s & 0s
Play a 7, you swap hands with someone
Play a 0, all hands rotate in the direction of the turn order."
Jed,Frostbite uno night @Tabletop
Jed,ok
Jed,uno?

Jed,jesus fuck what
Jed,I'm watching dbfz world tour finals
Jed,grand finals
Jed,go1 vs fenritti
Jed,"game one: go1 perfects fenritti
game two: fenritti perfects go1"
Jed,what the actual fuck
Jed,was it like 100-0 both games lol?
Jed,yeah
Jed,lol
Jed,do you know how rare a single perfect is in dbfz?
Jed,insanely rare
Jed,I don't watch this game that often but I've literally never seen one until today
Jed,well i mean if you can 100-0 i cant imagine its that rare
Jed,"""If you can do it, it's not rare"""
Jed,a 100-0 is a guaranteed perfect
Jed,
Jed,you jsut gotta land hte first hit
Jed,you dingus
Jed,when i say 100-0 i mean you hit a guy when hes full health and fully kill him without dropping combo
Jed,"you can only 100-0 with sparking (which is a once-per-game thing, and also often used defensively) and hella bar"
Jed,and only on one of their three characters
Jed,most of the time it's 2-3 openings per character
Jed,so you pretty much need 5-9 straight openings to perfect someone
Jed,"depending on your team (damage-heavy vs neutral/mix-heavy vs balanced) and meter management (meter for damage vs meter for mixups, sparking for defense vs damage vs pressure)"
Jed,nerd
Jed,@Master Memers I have it on good authority that @The Rona is the suck dick man
Jed,https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/662012908284280853.gif?v=1
Jed,COCK
Jed,you're the suck cock man?
Jed,cheese is kinda insane at sm64
Jed,
Jed,oof
Jed,I got an A so I'm fine but I feel bad for the others
Jed,(this was a Gen Chem II test)
Jed,it might get curved
Jed,I've never seen a math/science test get curved
Jed,don't you curve by the highest grade tho
Jed,I remember one of my old housemates calling her parents about getting a 28% on a midterm but that was okay since the class average was 22%
Jed,lol
Jed,damn
Jed,and that was engineering
Jed,but I guess it might depend on the school for what gets curved
Jed,"but still, odds are if it gets curved max's grade goes up"
Jed,I know my school curves business classes like accounting
Jed,"Also, my grade was 100 so it cannot go up"
Jed,ah well
Jed,This was supposedly the easiest test too
Jed,The class may shrink to a tiny size by the end of the semester if this trend continues
Jed,my guess is that those 6 people who failed are dragging the average down since most people seem to have done aight
Jed,they've probably given up on the course but haven't dropped yet
Jed,"meanwhile, in courses I wish I could drop, currently working on an assignment where this is one part of it:"
Jed,I have no idea what 'layout 2' is
Jed,this is the only use of the word 'layout' in the entire assignment
Jed,hmmm
Jed,so I've just decided to make my best guess at what they want here
Jed,"unfortunately, the whole assignment is like this"
Jed,so I'm making my best guess at like... half
Jed,this course is terrible but also mandatory
Jed,What course is this?
Jed,Software Requirements
Jed,it's all about how to plan software
Jed,"with the caveat that this is not, in any way, how anything works at any actual company"
Jed,sounds useless
Jed,it's a course about the pipe dream of how we wish people told us to make software
Jed,and the prof uses the word 'requirements' more than the word 'the'
Jed,it's 80% common sense and 20% buzzwords
Jed,I wish I still had classes where I could pass the tests on common sense alone
Jed,yes but also it's mind-numbingly boring and a shocking amount of work
Jed,I've been working on this assignment since like 2
Jed,ouch
Jed,most of that time has been consulting other people in the class and trying to put together a picture of wtf the prof wants us to do
Jed,Unclear instructions are the actual worst
Jed,You seem to get them a lot of the time
Jed,at this point we've all given up actually figuring anything out and we're just doing going with our best assumptions about what he wants
Jed,I hope he enjoys the eight pages of BS he's gonna be getting
Jed,also I hope that he stops doing the thing where whenever he posts the slides for a lecture it's all the slides for the whole course up until that point so you have to scroll through an increasingly long series of slides to reach the new stuff
Jed,"I may complain about my school a lot, but the one thing I will give it credit for is that the professors are of shockingly high quality on average."
Jed,mine are usually solid but there's generally one disaster per term
Jed,I've been told that's because my school attracts people who like the teaching part of being a prof rather than the research part.
Jed,"and yes, it's usually the researchers"
Jed,im zack's professor
Jed,Someone in my chem group chat just says he got a zero on the exam
Jed,i hate zack
Jed,I hope he read that one wrong
Jed,He did indeed
Jed,he actually got an A
Jed,the only test i've ever passed was a test on how to fail tests

Jed,GG
Jed,"there were group fuckups and I had to move to another group, they didn't change my group assignment in the system but said they'd match my final project's marks with the new group's"
Jed,that never fucking happened
Jed,final project was worth 30% of my grade
Jed,and with a zero on the system
Jed,I failed the course
Jed,thank god I have emails from the prof/TAs saying they'd do it
Jed,I've probably spent several hours over the last few weeks deliberating on what game to buy (board game) now that I have access to a place to play them weekly. I feel like my inability to choose is killing me but these games are just so expensive.

Jed,
Jed,
Jed,"so quick question. Any of you guys know of a kind of sweet candy/chocolate that has cream in the middle? I know it sounds like a weird question, but I'm doing research.

and I want a serious answer......"
Jed,like a twinky?
Jed,"maybe, but not quite"
Jed,I mean I might know the thing you're thinking of but just not immediately connecting the dots
Jed,"I'm not sure if something like this exists.... but I'm thinking of something that's kind of like the length of a churro, but cream filled"
Jed,crunchy? soft?
Jed,
Jed,maybe more like crunchy?
Jed,these things?
Jed,yeah something like that
Jed,it would be better if they were like a type of candy though.... but I can make this work if nothing else
Jed,happy to kinda sorta help
Jed,
Jed,What is this for??
Jed,a valentines gift
Jed,
Jed,For someone?
Jed,"yeah, a co-worker"
Jed,Oooh :0
Jed,good luck!
Jed, love is in the air
Jed,huzzah ya boi is getting the runaround by campus faculty
Jed,still stuck waiting on that one prof to fix my grade so that I'm not failing
Jed,found out that half the systems show me failing another course but the other half show me passing it so I'm also waiting on a fix for that
Jed,found out that my credits from the summer school I took back in 2016 never got transferred so I'm short six credits (equivalent to one full-year course) to graduate unless I can get that fixed and no one seems quite sure how that process is gonna work so I keep getting passed off to new people
Jed,and now all the faculty offices are closed so instead of shlepping all around campus I have to send emails which are inevitably gonna get ignored for awhile
Jed,Damn that shit must be fucking infuriating hope you get it all sorted out
Jed,yeh
Jed,I've at least done all I can for today until people email me back
Jed,Zack boi where are you going to work?
Jed,Where do you WANT* to work?
Jed,fuckin anywhere at this point
Jed,but honestly in the here and now my focus is on making sure I can dodge all these weird administrative fuckups and actually graduate
Jed,"cause it'd be real awkward to get hired and be like ""surprise I gotta do one more term of school cause my credits ain't got transferred properly"""
Jed,Well just remember you don't have to be honest on your resume. You can put you have your degree then explain the situation
Jed,IF THEY FUCK UP
Jed,I might be wrong but I feel like resumes are just ice breakers
Jed,"And if you are honest but can't even get your foot in the door, you will never have a chance to prove yourself "
Jed,GOOD LUCK BUDDY
Jed,I would hire you 
Jed,Just finished my first calculus 2 test (was an online class so I could have procrastinated in to next Monday at the latest) . Now I can go play terra mystica again tomorrow guilt free

Jed,it's like -16 fahrenheit
Jed,it's the kind of cold where going outside hurts your face
Jed,"like actual pain, not just cold"
Jed,Why the fuck is gotta be -22 on the day I wear the distressed denim smh
Jed,Bro I just saw some mother fucker in shorts
Jed,ballsy
Jed,I respect it
Jed,I knew someone in elementary school who did that
Jed,killed like 2/3 of the nerves in his legs and he doesn't feel cold anymore
Jed,so I think he might still be doing it
Jed,Man's crazy
Jed,actual baller move tbh
Jed,surgery on monday bois

Jed,Sounds tough 
Jed,

Jed,Yo  @Zain good luck at summit
Jed,yeah thats fine
Jed,thanks i appreciate the support
Jed,History might be in the making with this set
Jed,Axe might actually lose to a marth
Jed,@Rotomotorz
Jed,Axe is crazy
Jed,
Jed,I wish rivals was as big as melee
Jed,"Rivals is a cool game, I would also like it to be better known"
Jed,Wrastor is maybe my favorite platform fighter character ever
Jed,He fits what I want in a character so well

Jed,I ples join?
Jed,@S H E L F

Jed,Ip
Jed,IP
Jed,kk
Jed,sauce
Jed,what version?
Jed,20w06a snapshot
Jed,its not gonna be up tonight since imma leave in like 30 mins ish
Jed,but ill sauce you ip and you can join the next time its up 
Jed,
Jed,I'll play mc
Jed,okay I'm back @Cs:go
Jed,"i would be interested, but I think people are gone"
Jed,You're dumb
Jed,is that a yay or nay from you smith
Jed,"When I ordered something from Amazon it said the delivery would be Sunday. The page was still up and it said it could ""ship by Saturday if you order within the next 6 hours!"" So I cancelled my order and ordered again lol. I have no idea why this happened."
Jed,The time gap between the orders was like 9 hours
Jed,"So I'm going to visit my brother over reading week, checked and apparently there was supposed to be a 2-3 hour wait to get through customs"
Jed,There was no line at all
Jed,My flight doesn't leave for another two hours
Jed,F
Jed,I'm sitting in a very overpriced restaurant staring down this bottle of fiji water they leave at every table and presumably have to pay like $15 if you open
Jed,go to a cheaper restaurant and feast on something?
Jed,They're all super expensive
Jed,Or moderately expensive and serve tiny portions
Jed,Feels Airport Man
Jed,And I haven't eaten yet today and my flight keeps getting delayed
Jed,So I'm willing to pay the five extra dollars for bigger better food
Jed,sounds like a plan
Jed,hbox legitimately looks unbeatable
Jed,he dominated 4 players who have historically gave him at least a bit of trouble
Jed,i dunno if fox beats puff tbh
Jed,not in b05 with sdi existing
Jed,I think fox is the best character against puff whether he wins or not
Jed,Puff is just overpowered. Puff gets to play brawl while everyone else plays melee.
Jed,amsa is sick
Jed,like he lost but he's sick
Jed,oh hope he gets better
Jed,@Cs:go
Jed,"If we get some peeps, sure"
Jed,ok
Jed,@trashpanda risky rain with me and devon
Jed,?
Jed,@Homies  we play MvM at some point tomorrow
Jed,Tomorrow is Summit finals day
Jed,No
Jed,Your point
Jed,I'm going to be occupied with that
Jed,Just don't
Jed,In addition to other things
Jed,Watch vods
Jed,
Jed,no
Jed,
Jed,max gay
Jed,
Jed,this summit final bracket is hype
Jed,zain plup
Jed,facts
Jed,hbox maNG
Jed,anyone can win tbh
Jed,maNG
Jed,BUMPED CAPS
Jed,again
Jed,also 9 top 10 players left
Jed,no m2k lol
Jed,wait there are like no top sheiks anymore
Jed,And then I said
Jed,Penis
Jed,yeah same
Jed,i think that if fox players win game 1 vs puff/marth they should just sd 4 times in the counterpick
Jed,like no meme
Jed,its more important to preserve momentum than to maybe win on the counterpick
Jed,I think people prone to tilting might do this but I don't think everyone should.
Jed,i do
Jed,at top level
Jed,its literally not worth the risk
Jed,fox never beats zain on fd
Jed,vs marth maybe I could see that everyone should
Jed,not vs puff though
Jed,even if you win dreamland
Jed,you have to play it again
Jed,giving hbox so much momentum and info
Jed,Maybe I'm biased because Dreamland is my favorite stage but I would never forfeit that game.
Jed,and it burns the fox player out
Jed,making them prone to make more mistakes in future games
Jed,The fact that this is even a discussion means the ruleset is broken
Jed,bans
Jed,id like to see the stats
Jed,of how much hbox wins on the fox's counterpick
Jed,after winning the second dreamland game
Jed,i guarantee its real high
Jed,why not just stand still on the counterpick
Jed,like honestly losing dreamland the first time might be better sometimes
Jed,plup is godlike
Jed,I think this is the first win vs Hbox since Plup won genesis
Jed,hbox hasnt lost so badly since mang0 at birthday bash
Jed,ggs
Jed,dreamland 
Jed,so dumb
Jed,puff dies early
Jed,that was a good tourney still
Jed,Yeah
Jed,Sup everyone?
Jed,hi
Jed,hi
Jed,Sup mrd256?

Jed,
Jed, 
Jed,he should've hired me to edit his videos
Jed,RIP
Jed,I'm on the home stretch boys
Jed,Videos were fun but engineering ability is what matters on the last leg of the race 
Jed,
Jed,
Jed,"Some guy left a comment on the video like ""We reviewed your channel and have decided you aren't a good fit. Just leave this here to bring some closure"""
Jed,Even though I know it's a troll it still bothered me
Jed,So delete it

Jed,Fuck them dude
Jed,They're just jealous

Jed,I did
Jed,IDK why I even read comments 
Jed,@Cs:go ?
Jed,ok
Jed,"In an extremely ill-advised decision, I'm currently at a casino with my brother"
Jed,Time to lose $80usd
Jed,win money
Jed,Good advice
Jed,Just think of gambling as paying for entertainment rather than a way to earn money
Jed, 
Jed,Well yeah
Jed,Also a way to make him stop bothering me about going to the casino
Jed,"I've heard that helps soften the blow of the inevitable loss and prevent going in too much to ""win it back"""
Jed,Yeah
Jed,I've committed to losing $80 and if I lose less it's an accomplishment
Jed,Good mindset
Jed,Bit of a roller coaster so far but atm I'm only down $4
Jed,Nice
Jed,$4 is not much
Jed,Lost like $50 on one hand tho
Jed,Playing poker?
Jed,he was playing blind and got triple sevens
Jed,What moron plays blind
Jed,"Yeah, Texas hold em"
Jed,Texas hold em is the only valid poker
Jed,Hes doing really well
Jed,Could afford to play blind one hand
Jed,Poker is the only gambling I would consider since I can use skill to win
Jed,"Yeah, to a point at least"
Jed,I'm alright at the game but have never played with real money
Jed,I've played for really small money once
Jed,First time at a casino tho
Jed,Im out lol
Jed,Pocket kings lost to pocket aces
Jed,rip
Jed,Did you lost all $80?
Jed,"@here 
Heyyyy so I’m doing a research paper on the the youth’s political ideology, and would love it if y’all could fill out my survey :)

Jed,Very quick
Jed,Super fast
Jed,wait thats what smithy looks like

Jed,if you identify as The Youth you are The Youth
Jed,"How could I have been so foolish, how right you are"
Jed,"No, he's left"
Jed,This is Zack we are talking about
Jed,"@Homies I've recently discovered a game that I think could be great fun for our group if everyone is willing to learn it. It features highly asymmetric factions (apparently balanced), information trading, treachery, and alliance making and breaking. Tonight I am pretty free if people want to get together and play it on tabletop simulator. It plays best with 6 players so please let me know if you are interested. (The game is Dune)"
Jed,@Advanced Memers
Jed,"Players interested so far: Max, Chris, Devon, maybe Greg"
Jed,@Rotomotorz Were you interested?
Jed,maybe but depends on when u plan to play
Jed,"This evening, I suppose around 8:00 since that is when devon gets back"
Jed,I never said that
Jed,Where’s your proof
Jed,Please don't be difficult
Jed,I had that as an option so I could remove anyone who didn’t vote within the right demographic
Jed,Because I put it on a subreddit
Jed,Ty for taking my survey tho :)))
Jed,Dune sounds dumb
Jed,But any of you boys heard of zune?
Jed,Them boys play music
Jed,"Bruh a customer spent like $300 in the store and was like “I gotta stop spending so much money, I guess this is better than spending it on mafia city” and I was like “the phone app?” And this mf says “yeah I’ve sunk like $3000 into it with nothing to show for it”"
Jed,BRO
Jed,What
Jed,Why
Jed,No fucking clue
Jed,Who looks at an ad for that game

Jed,

Jed,you're mother
Jed,I would make one but I dont know how
Jed,so yell at @Zain to do it
Jed,"I mean I can do it, but wouldn't it be better to have the server hosted by someone who lives closer to everyone cuz I'm not that close relative to a lot of people in the server"
Jed,Sounds just like someone who doesn't want to set up the server
Jed,We should probably pick a modpack first though
Jed,Do we want a more vanilla friendly pack? An rpg-esque pack? A tech heavy pack?
Jed,I mean I'll set it up doesn't matter to me and tech heavy in my opinion
Jed,"Check out crackpack 3, All the mods 4, engineer's life, valhelsia 2, enigmatica 4"
Jed,Those are all interesting looking ones

Jed,@The Rona idk about crack pack but i think fusions computer might literally explode if he tries to host all the mods 4
Jed,Crackpack seems kinda wack
Jed,Not as much tech as I thought there was going to be

Eventually realized that I'm arguing that the author is trying to show that a major component of good is to seek knowledge beyond that which is directly handed to you, and reaching that conclusion required me to put down the story he wrote and go read Plato to understand those four sentences.

But what finally got him the ban was unapolagetically using 'faggot' and 'gay'. This went over poorly with our TOs, who are:

Jed,people are dumb
Jed,'specially at community college
Jed,hey
Jed,thats me
Jed,"Jed, you are dumb"
Jed,especially at community college
Jed,correct
Jed,@Max they probably do not care
Jed,This was one of the classes 3 major assignments and not meeting the visual aid requirement is an instant F. If they care so little they would just fail a major assignment why would they even be there.
Jed,It's not like they didn't prepare a speech. The speeches were actually pretty alright.

Jed,"@Homies I have invented a social deduction game that is quite different from any that are currently popular (Secret Hitler, Avalon, Mafia, Werewolf, etc.) and would like to playtest it this weekend if possible. It features such things as a globally known person on the good side who cannot be killed and leads the investigation, the possibility to kill for the bad guys with risk involved for doing so, and an interesting bluffing dynamic of ""confinement without execution""."

Jed,The 1 coin goes on the 6 coin
Jed,@Mr. Airplane
Jed,Devon has 1 extra coin
Jed,@Eric Working From Home
Jed,I would be mad about that takeback
Jed,Sorry Devon
Jed,Did Devon do anything?
Jed,I think you skipped his turn?
Jed,ah
Jed,ok
Jed,Science victory or nothing
Jed,Do we have that record saved?
Jed,@Eric Working From Home

Jed,something by zach
Jed,like
Jed,68 points
Jed,Took care of Chris's income
Jed,Don't forget your 5 points
Jed,@The Rona Don't forget you can burn power
Jed,If you need stuff
Jed,Place on brown unless you need 2 towns there
Jed,Digging for 3 workers is a terrible idea
Jed,burn power
Jed,You could use double dig power action and build on both reds
Jed,@The Rona
Jed,actually you need to build a dwelling on the empty space first
Jed,so they are both in range
Jed,yeah
Jed,Now just try and get coins
Jed,I did it
Jed,For you
Jed,It moved from bowl 1
Jed,Did you tell him you can turn workers to money?
Jed,You should highly consider the 6 coin bonus
Jed,Yeah I think so
Jed,Do you want me to get your income Chris?
Jed,2 power
Jed,"Now you can easily prep at least 1 town for the town bonus round, maybe even 2."
Jed,This is a bad impression of the game for Chris @Mr. Airplane
Jed,sure
Jed,Chris and I were making such a great plan
Jed,rip game
Jed,@Eric Working From Home What is being joined?
Jed,Laughing actually hurts right now so I'll pass

Jed,this game is such a blast
Jed,no smile
Jed,this lookin mega weeb tbh
Jed,a wee bit
Jed,it's sooooo fuuuuun thooooo
Jed,What do you use as a controller for this?
Jed,"I'm using my stick, but it's pretty straightforward so I'd assume just about any controller or keyboard would work"
Jed,"it's 8-directional movement, 4 attacks, and one 'move slower so you can be more precise' button"
Jed,so just about any modern or modern-ish controller should be fine
Jed,I might get it later today
Jed,I've been bored
Jed,Though I wouldn't be able to talk while playing
Jed,"aight, lemme know if you want to play at some point (the multiplayer is way better than the single player imo)"

Jed,Gyazo
Jed,this some bullshit
Jed,What blizzard game do you even play?
Jed,cod
Jed,what do you guys think of these character designs?
Jed,One thing you might want to consider is that the girl's shirt looks like an Easter egg pattern. Whether or not you want that is up to you.
Jed,very saturated and clashing colors
Jed,Easter Egg pattern?
Jed,oh yeah it does lol
Jed,
Jed,it looks like a typical design you'd find on an easter egg
Jed,kinda like this
Jed,oh Shirt! I thought you said Skirt.
Jed,"but yeah, that's what the original shirt looked like, so I went with it"
Jed,but i think the dark blue on gray is no bueno
Jed,Original?
Jed,the values are way too similar you can hardly see the design
Jed,allow me to explain
Jed,I build my character designs by using bits and pieces from other designs...
Jed,this is where I got the shirt and jacket
Jed,Those colours work better
Jed,I agree ^
Jed,better contrast
Jed,thats what im sayin
Jed,so maybe change the color of the vest?
Jed,No
Jed,The actual shirt itself
Jed,the shirt or the design
Jed,on the shirt
Jed,make it contrast
Jed,really? I think the black and blue go well together
Jed,either the pattern colour or the base shirt colour
Jed,they're way too similar
Jed,the design fades into the shirt
Jed,hmm alright
Jed,but i would also recommend toning down the vest as it is much to bright and saturated
Jed,also the male character's hair is wayyyyy too blue and bright as well
Jed,he looks like Sonic
Jed,how about a white shirt instead of black?
Jed,also the whole thing is a bit generic
Jed,yeah that seems better
Jed,
Jed,yes better
Jed,maybe now you should change the socks too
Jed,maybe now she needs white socks
Jed,"and I agree. The guy looks a little too monotone. I want the blue hair, so what other colors should be changed"
Jed,yeah I'd say white socks + black on the shoes
Jed,but i dont think the blue hair would work with anything
Jed,it doesn't suit the art style
Jed,well maybe idk
Jed,"something else to keep in mind....... these aren't ""natural"" designs either. Like no one could have a ponytail that long and think (don't take that out of context)"
Jed,omg
Jed,i know this bro
Jed,i make really unrealistic designs of blue dogs
Jed,but there still are principals of character design
Jed,"I'm aware. Like I said, I think the guy looks a little monotone, so I feel like some colors should be changed"
Jed,probably the bandada
Jed,"other than his hair, because I want to keep the blue hair"
Jed,bandana
Jed,i didnt even see it at first since it matched the shirt color
Jed,"hmm, ok. Or I could change his shirt."
Jed,true
Jed,but if you change the shirt make sure it doesnt clash with the vest or pants
Jed,"but I feel like something other than black. Because then he'd look a little too ""dark"""
Jed,well he's got blue jeans. Almost anything goes with blue jeans
Jed,i also think the shoes look a tad out of place since there is not brown anywhere else
Jed,maybe you could make something else brown
Jed,this is where I got the body for his design.
Jed,wow you barely changed a thing
Jed,he also looks very generic
Jed,like all harem protagonists
Jed,yeah and thats not good
Jed,give him a mohawk
Jed,are you making a harem?
Jed,Not with this guy
Jed,i think the outfit is just kinda plain
Jed,needs something else
Jed,"Well I gave him a scarf, so I thought that added something"
Jed,yeah but idk I personally dont like his vest thingy
Jed,but thats just me
Jed,anyone else?
Jed,I think you're a weeb
Jed,are you an artist at all?
Jed,or are you just making designs to get other people to draw them
Jed,No. Hence why I use other design pieces to make mine
Jed,hmm
Jed,I can't even draw lines without screwing them up
Jed,well thats because you probably havent really practiced
Jed,that's how bad an artist I am
Jed,bruh
Jed,everyone starts off bad
Jed,you're bad for AT LEAST a solid year
Jed,usually way longer
Jed,did it also come across to you I don't feel like becoming an artist. I'd rather not spend a year practicing a skill I'll never use
Jed,fair ig
Jed,you didnt say that at all tho
Jed,"but i mean,, art isnt really a skill you never use if you, yknow, draw"
Jed,Eh
Jed,i find a lot of fulfillment in drawing for the sake of drawing but i know not everyone's like that
Jed,but its not a pointless skill
Jed,Did I ever show you guys my commissions I had done?
Jed,you showed us one
Jed,fair
Jed,lol what kind of response is that
Jed,well there's just one more I plan to get done when his next session opens up
Jed,oh so you've only had one done so far
Jed,I've actually had 2
Jed,1 character done twice
Jed,i thought one of them was a group photo
Jed,"there's the group photo, but there's also the single one, which I had done first"
Jed,this one was more a test
Jed,aaa thats pretty cute
Jed,I do really like this one.
Jed,same shirt design as your new character tho
Jed,this character I mean
Jed,because I use the same one lol
Jed,huh?
Jed,"I wanted to give her a short sleeved shirt with a vest, and that was the best I could find"
Jed,"tbf, her design was made long before the one I just showed you"
Jed,yeah but that doesn't mean you should give your other characters the same clothes lol
Jed,"eh, whether I give these guys full life or not is still in the air. I just made them to kill some time"
Jed,fair ig
Jed,use that creativity tho bro
Jed,this is the girl I plan to get commissioned next.
Jed,who is probably my favorite character of them all
Jed,:o cute
Jed,"A lot of my fans of the fanfiction I write also like her. In fact, in a poll I did on my server, she ranked the highest out of all the others"
Jed,how many people you got in that server? :0
Jed,You have a big enough fan base to have a discord server?
Jed,wow
Jed,"let me check the action number, cause I can't remember"
Jed,"Well I've got 34 on the server, but not all of my fans are on my server"
Jed,if I look at my ff.net account (which is where I post the fanfic)
Jed,"the story has 26 followers, so add that to the 34 on my server"
Jed,wow
Jed,Wow the vanguard wiki even has a page for your alternate universe
Jed,WHAT
Jed,ARE YOU FR
Jed,how'd you find that out???
Jed,google
Jed,please send me link
Jed,"plus there are the ones who don't follow the story or on my server, but I know they're reading it."
Jed,Those I can't count
Jed,did you add that page yourself
Jed,"if it's on the fanon wiki, than yes, I added it myself"
Jed,https://cardfightvanguardfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cardfight!!_Vanguard_X
Jed,Cardfight!! Vanguard X
Jed,Cardfight!! Vanguard X is a fan fiction series made by mrd256. It acts as a sequel to G that takes place 20 years later.
Jed,there's a link to the fanfic on this page
Jed,"just a fair warning, the fanfic might contain a few missing words here and there, and a few grammar mistakes, but I'm trying to get better"
Jed,well idk anything about the original story so
Jed,you actually really don't need to understand the original story to get this.
Jed,"since it takes place in the future and has it's own story.

also, if they recall back the events in the canon, then I throw in a short summery of what happened"
Jed,"for example, in one of the most recent chapters, two canon characters, who are friends with the heroine's father, explain how they became friends with him, which are actual events that happened in the original show."
Jed,"still, i think its odd to read fanfiction if you've never watched/read/whatever the source. I know some people disagree with me though !"
Jed,"eh, I somewhat agree with you"
Jed,the story also has over 400 views and 31 reviews
Jed,What's most valuable lesson you learned while writing this? I plan on writing a book in a few months so some tips would be appreciated.
Jed,"something is, write every character like they are the protagonist of their own story."
Jed,"obviously you have you story's main protagonist, but in reality, everyone leads their own life"
Jed,"So you should reflect that in your stories. Give them personalities that flow with their back stories, and maybe put a little twist on them if you can"
Jed,My story has 4 maybe 5 point of view characters so I'll definitely need to do this
Jed,"for example, maybe a character had a tragic back story, but they act all happy and cheerful"
Jed,maybe use that happy and cheerful personality as way for them to cover up their pain and despair
Jed,"and when their tragic event is brought up, you (the viewer) sees a different side to them you never thought they had"
Jed,that can be a key to make 2 or even 3 dimensional characters
Jed,I've been planning my story for almost a year so I hope it goes well once I start
Jed,I always think of ideas for stories but this one is my favorite of them all
Jed,I've never had one develop so fully before
Jed,"all stories can take time, but sometimes, a good strategy is to release 1 chapter/1 volume at a time. This will make the view anxious or curious as to what's gonna happen next"
Jed,"also, it gives you time to learn what you did wrong in previous chapters and learn from them to improve future ones"
Jed,I'm still trying to decide if I should release my story chapter by chapter or wait until the whole thing is done. I'm leaning towards waiting until its done so I can present the best possible product.
Jed,I'll probably have a small number of test readers who read it live though
Jed,I kinda like to do both
Jed,"if I have a story that's fairly short, I'll just release the whole thing at once"
Jed,"but Vanguard X is a pretty long story, spanning across a total of 4 seasons, and 2 spin off series."
Jed,"where the story lies right now, I'm entering the last chapter of the first arc of season 1"
Jed,I've never written a serious project like this so I have no idea how long it will end up being
Jed,well your first project is always gonna suck. No matter what it is
Jed,I do know it has three main parts though
Jed,I hope to avoid that
Jed,I have done some less serious projects to practice
Jed,I didn't mean to discourage you
Jed,"For me personally, I try to keep a positive mindset."
Jed,I think it leads to the best results.
Jed,That is true
Jed,and that's something I envy about you.
Jed,"lately, I've had a hard time staying positive with all the crap that's been going on in my life"
Jed,Good luck getting though it
Jed,It's actually gotten to the point where I need to see a therapist
Jed,I've already got an appointment scheduled next week
Jed,I've never been to therapy so I don't know much about it but I hope it helps
Jed,me too
Jed,"well it's about time for me to hit the hay. I have work tomorrow, so I'm gonna try and get some sleep"
Jed,good night

Jed,
Jed,1 for each video frame
Jed,$10 for 20 images
Jed,@Feral Nebula ?
Jed,This is my opportunity
Jed,wait what?? how are we supposed to make them
Jed,Don't ask others
Jed,ok
Jed,
Jed,450 is a lot
Jed,I dont care how you make them
Jed,You just need to draw in a single color over the vessels
Jed,and another color over the brain reigons (blue)
Jed,you need 450 of the first image you sent?
Jed,you can probably just use photoshop filters
Jed,I have to create all this fucking training data so I can make a computer automatically do it
Jed,Wait
Jed,You want me to recreate the same image
Jed,with different colours?
Jed,you are basically just creating a label that says
Jed,HEY
Jed,these pixels are blood vessles
Jed,Ok wait hol up
Jed,and these other pixels are NOT blood vessels
Jed,okay send me the files
Jed,it just has to be too colors
Jed,wait i wanna do some too
Jed,uploading them to g drive rn
Jed,its going to take all night
Jed,because I was a fucking retard with the way I extracted these
Jed,and I don't want to redo it lol
Jed,"they don't all have to be done by the same person, right?"
Jed,ehhh honestly it would be best if the same person did it because I am willing to bet there are variations in the way different people would label these images
Jed,so anyone who is interested can fight amongst the other people who want the job
Jed,Ill let the free market work in my favor here 
Jed,I NEED IT
Jed,DIBS
Jed,
Jed,I just need my labelled images ASAP and as cheap as possible
Jed,Gonna make fat stacks
Jed,
Jed,i bet i could do it faster than you
Jed,race
Jed,Wait so
Jed,You have a big foler of a bunch of images similar to this
Jed,"or like, each start from opposite ends and meet in the middle"
Jed,That you just need in different colours?
Jed,Are they all coloured in purple and yellow?
Jed,Oh wait
Jed,a
Jed,minute
Jed,I get it
Jed,Actually small append
Jed,BLACK for vessels
Jed,WHITE for brain reigons
Jed,and yes I am willing to have a race
Jed,Ava will start from the bottom of the folder
Jed,chris will start from the top
Jed,wait how is that a race then
Jed,wtf
Jed,whoever gets halfway through first has to do the rest?
Jed,what ab out me
Jed,whoever reaches the halfway point first
Jed,okay chris starts at the top
Jed,dober starts at the 1 /3
Jed,OKAY FUCK THIS
Jed,that seems like a waste of time tho for whoever doesnt win
Jed,Just fight amongst yourselves and decide who gets the job
Jed,i'm going to bed!
Jed,what format are the files in?
Jed,JPG
Jed,bruh
Jed,needs more JPG
Jed,smh bad business man just abandoning things
Jed,Wrong
Jed,I am going to let the market work in my favor while sleeping
Jed,When I wakeup someone will have won the contract by out bidding there components for who can do the work cheapest and quickest  Or if you guys are really smart you will conspire by electing 1 person to officially take the job. Demanding a hire wage for that person. Then splitting the work amongst yourselfs
Jed,  Food for thought  ? 
Jed,i thought you said one person had to do them all
Jed,"don't condescend me, buddy"
Jed,also you havent even given us the files yet

Jed,especially cause someone I know and usually beat is seeded 14th (he actually enters these so they know how to place him) so I have a chance to make some upsets
Jed,welp I ended up seeded to fight top seed in winner's r2 so that went poorly
Jed,we also somehow had 90 ping
Jed,but I don't think that would have changed the results one bit

Jed,"There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.
All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.
IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.
IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.
Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.
Cognitive ability is substantially heritable, apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent."

Jed,and
Jed,they're all
Jed,locked behind fucking paywalls
Jed,what the fuck is this bullshit
Jed,have u tried sci-hub
Jed,I might have to
Jed,but mostly I just want to highlight the sheer incompetence of this professor
Jed,"like, maybe he has memberships to all these random ass journals on software development"
Jed,but his students sure as hell don't
Jed,also our summary/review thing has to be 2 pages and the only one of these papers I've found that isn't pay-to-read is only two pages including pictures
Jed,the summary would have to be longer than the original
Jed,shoot me
Jed,haha good luck with that
Jed,anyone have a video of kameron?

Jed,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence.
Jed,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence. Then by continually bouncing off the slippers and the bed we can generate enough momentum to clip through the floor and skip the window sequence.

Jed,i'm probably gonna stream it
Jed,?
Jed,@everyone games cs ow ?
Jed,@here
Jed,games
Jed,SURE
Jed,i guess thats a no from everone else lol
Jed,So I just thought of an interesting challenge.
Jed,"I call it the ""Bottom Tier Challenge""

You take the lowest tiered character in some kind of competitive fighting game (like Smash), and you keep doing random join ups with random people, until you get a legitimate victory using that character.

here's what counts as a legitimate victory. You have to win via the conditions set in the rules. You cannot win via a timeout, or your opponent disconnects.

You stop play at all before you get a legit win, you fail the challenge."
Jed,very neat idea
Jed,Have you won this challenge in any games?
Jed,I have not.
Jed,Also @Max you were up pretty early this morning
Jed,mha finale p good

Jed,is the game good?
Jed,no
Jed,dont get it
Jed,alright tuning into 5 streams rn
Jed,is it any more effective to have multiple streams open?
Jed,idk if this works but in theory you could open a stream and mute it so your twitch default opens streams muted them jsut go to the valorant directory and middle click each stream to open them all then ctrl+tab through them all so they are all marked as open then just minimize hte window
Jed,cause you dont have to actually have hte stream unmuted on an active window to recieve drops
Jed,@Cs:go

Jed,Looks like I now have a chemistry test every week since I was off for like a month lol

Jed,oh also you missed that one game where Kameron went like 32-6
Jed,he was going pretty ham last night
Jed,i can't account for games that i have not played in

- Ben ^2

Jed,oh boy apparently the Valorant anti-cheat has root-level access to your computer 24/7
Jed,we have all handed riot our entire computers
Jed,@The Rona I forgot to add zain and since you were last you are out 
Jed,Sounds like Zain's problem
Jed,‍♂️
Jed,Nah dude
Jed,"so yeah even if they weren't already, China now owns your entire computer"
Jed,uh
Jed,"""Ring-0 is essentially the lowest level something can run in.

Running in this permission level essentially means that a given driver has full administrative access to your operating system before it even throws a login screen. It can monitor the boot process, check every driver and device that loads at boot (at least after it's loaded), and can run arbitrary code without any input or knowledge from the user.

It doesn't matter whether you're logged in or not, or whether you've even played the game recently. It is ALWAYS running."""
Jed,and uninstalling Valorant won't uninstall the monitoring
Jed,so we have to reinstall windows?
Jed,wait i'm not sure that's true
Jed,you can uninstall it manually but it's a separate thing
Jed,and significantly more complicated
Jed,I saw someone talking about this in a stream too
Jed,It is true
Jed,wtf
Jed,Wait so am I not in the 10 man
Jed,Rip
Jed,and posts about this stuff is getting banned on r/valorant
Jed,Also people were reporting performance loss in other games due to this
Jed,so what do I need to delete?
Jed,whoops
Jed,@Matt I forgot about max too
Jed,Max has your spot sorry buddy
Jed,Whew
Jed,Accept the Chinese Communist Party into your heart
Jed,
Jed,this is riots response to it
Jed,yeah what do I delete
Jed,Why did you delete that
Jed,"If you delete it, then you can't play the game"
Jed,"there's some control panel level stuff, here's the thread I'm seeing: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/g0gdug/riots_trusted_valorant_mods_deleted_a_thread/"
Jed,r/pcgaming - Riot's 'Trusted' /Valorant mods deleted a thread about...
Jed,"9,084 votes and 1,544 comments so far on Reddit"
Jed,
Jed,but then yeah you can't play the game
Jed,"TL;DR Yes we run a driver at system startup, it doesn't scan anything (unless the game is running), it's designed to take up as few system resources as possible and it doesn't communicate to our servers. You can remove it at anytime.

Vanguard contains a driver component called vgk.sys (similar to other anti-cheat systems), it's the reason why a reboot is required after installing. Vanguard doesn't consider the computer trusted unless the Vanguard driver is loaded at system startup (this part is less common for anti-cheat systems).

This is good for stopping cheaters because a common way to bypass anti-cheat systems is to load cheats before the anti-cheat system starts and either modify system components to contain the cheat or to have the cheat tamper with the anti-cheat system as it loads. Running the driver at system startup time makes this significantly more difficult.

We've tried to be very careful with the security of the driver. We've had multiple external security research teams review it for flaws (we don't want to accidentally decrease the security of the computer like other anti-cheat drivers have done in the past). We're also following a least-privilege approach to the driver where the driver component does as little as possible preferring to let the non-driver component do the majority of work (also the non-driver component doesn't run unless the game is running)."
Jed,I'd rather not play the game then have my data mined
Jed,"The Vanguard driver does not collect or send any information about your computer back to us. Any cheat detection scans will be run by the non-driver component only when the game is running.

The Vanguard driver can be uninstalled at any time (it'll be ""Riot Vanguard"" in Add/Remove programs) and the driver component does not collect any information from your computer or communicate over the network at all.

We think this is an important tool in our fight against cheaters but the important part is that we're here so that players can have a good experience with Valorant and if our security tools do more harm than good we will remove them (and try something else). For now we think a run-at-boot time driver is the right choice."
Jed,thats the riot response
Jed,Lets review the fax
Jed,bullshit
Jed,literally no one else does this and it's functionally malware
Jed,riot is conviniently owned by 10cent
Jed,they can run anything they want on your computer with this
Jed,it's also not stopping hackers
Jed,"and even assuming there's no malicious intent, the second this gets cracked fuckin anyone who wants gets root level access to your computer and can do malicious things with it"
Jed,antivirus software does this
Jed,yes but our antivirus software isn't owned by a company owned by China
Jed,a country famous for not invading privacy for malicious purposes
Jed,"also, people are already beating the anticheat"
Jed,so it's not insane to assume someone has or will soon beat the security and boom we're all even more compromised
Jed,apparently this is an article response to it https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/dev-null-anti-cheat-kernel-driver/
Jed,/dev/null: Anti-Cheat Kernel Driver - League of Legends
Jed,We’re protecting some of Riot’s upcoming games with new anti-cheat systems.
Jed,yeh I still don't really trust it
Jed,"because no matter what it's still extremely sketchy to need that level of access, especially if it's not working"
Jed,yeah if we are going this tin foil hat then there is literally nothing any one could say
Jed,yup
Jed,but there's plenty of good reasons to tinfoil hat on this one
Jed,Yeah literally
Jed,namely the censorship of r/valorant
Jed,"on the other hand, there's no real reason to panic cause odds are your computer's already hella compromised"
Jed,fusion doesnt use a vpn when he torrents all of those games so i doubt hes scared of anyone
Jed,ok if we are worried about the big bad tencent and china then we must be worried about all of these companies as well right https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/
Jed,Every game company that Tencent has invested in
Jed,A quick reference of how China's largest tech conglomerate has quietly expanded into videogames.
Jed,@Jed
Jed,have my spot
Jed,@Zain
Jed,"yes, yes I am Zain"
Jed,but none of them have installed root-level permission software on my computer
Jed,Zack you can get so much information off of discord but why do you still use this application when Tencent has invested in it as well
Jed,"like, on one hand, I'm still gonna play Valorant because I assume everything I do is already tracked by at least someone sketchy because realistically you can't avoid it, but on the other hand, I think people should understand what's going on

also are you insane in comparing what they can get out of discord vs. always on root access"
Jed,if we are worried about selling our information or compromising or security this would priority number one no?
Jed,"discord can't run any code it wants with any level of permission on my computer without me knowing about it
discord can't see every single thing I do on my computer
discord can't look at every single file on my computer at all times"
Jed,"discord can see what I put into discord: messages, voice, occasionally video, what game I'm playing, and the files I post"
Jed,ok sure

Jed,"Copied from another server: PLEASE do not play TF2 or ANY source games in the meantime. A serious leak of source code has been reportedly leaked into the public. If true, it means source games are easily compromised and you should not play them at the moment.What this means is cheaters could potentially install programs or get information from your PC through source games if true.(Allegedly) the developer of cathook has discovered a way to RCE (remote code execute) on TF2 just by you being in the server. This allows anyone who does this to run any code on your computer, including viruses, turning your game into an aimbot, or deleting your items. Playing any source game, including TF2 is dangerous right now, and we suggest not playing until there is some kind of fix for this."

Jed,"wtf is this ""home row"" you talkin about"
Jed,ever noticed how f and j have marks on them

Jed,yo who was kameron referring to in the quote
Jed,i dunno
Jed,how do you. not know
Jed,you said it
Jed,i said it because i dont know
Jed,It was probably a character from danganronpa who's name he does not remember
Jed,this boy
Jed,oh my god
Jed,That guy is 100% guilty
Jed,I don't care that I have not played the game
Jed,Huge criminal vibes

Jed,
Jed,Whyyyyyy
Jed,This is so random
Jed,The first two are basically RNG
Jed,wtf
Jed,wtf
Jed,I have no idea what to do
Jed,I'm so confused
Jed,
Jed,This is not what he is referring to
Jed,We played a game in class months ago where we stood in a circle and played some adding game
Jed,I do not remember the exact rules though
Jed,wtf is this class it sounds really retarded
Jed,It's public speaking
Jed,Not like you could figure that out from the test questions though lol
Jed,owch
Jed,You know something's up when you don't know even remotely what class someone is by looking at test questions
Jed,This is the least relevant test I've ever seen
Jed,Most of the questions are normal but like 20% are garbage like above
Jed,"I don't know if what I said sounded insulting, but believe me, I'm only insulting the test."
Jed,
Jed,ikd max but that sounds like an insult
Jed,I wrote it poorly
Jed,I was trashing the test
Jed,not you
Jed,if i had to take a guess i'd say its some type of philisophical course but like
Jed,lol
Jed,"Sorry Benson, I only realized it could sound like an insult towards you like 30 seconds after sending it"
Jed,Definitely was not my intention
Jed,non taken. just poking fun at your wording choice
