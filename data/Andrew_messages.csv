Andrew,"Ok so all this server is a hub for friends to play games, chat, hangout, and genrally have fun. This server is ment to be a replacement for the orginal frostbite server that has become very large and unwieldy. The orginal frostbite server has also become very inactive and stagnate as a result of its size. That is why am hopeing to keep this community relatively small so that we can be active and have fun."

Andrew,cause they don't trust me apperently
Andrew,they were so caught up in what they could do that they didn't stop to think about whether or not they SHOULD
Andrew,also what do they think you're doing on youtube? watching porn?
Andrew,yup
Andrew,I'm like 95% sure that's not something you can do
Andrew,I'm gonna assume that youtube filters that kind of thing
Andrew,also do they not realize there are much better sources of that kind of thing?

Andrew,oh I know that
Andrew,oh
Andrew,I don't get their reasoning

Andrew,I did
Andrew,its the chronological order all the marvel movies take place in timeline wise
Andrew,How was this timeline created?
Andrew,people with alot of time on their hands
Andrew,i mean it makes sense
Andrew,starts with first captain america and ends with guardians of the galaxy
Andrew,What the hell is Cloak & Dagger?
Andrew,unreleased stuff
Andrew,clock can travel into different dimensions and dagger kills people
Andrew,its a little tv series that hasnt come out yet
Andrew,"""clock"""
Andrew,cloak*
Andrew,lol
Andrew,I wasn't doubting the validness(?) of the timeline
Andrew,I was just wondering how they determined it
Andrew,Because I am interested in that stuff
Andrew,for the released stuff its kinda obvious
Andrew,since they use specific dates in the actual movies
Andrew,so you can jsut be like oh yeah
Andrew,there it is
Andrew,and for the unreleased stuff i think its jsut Theory Crafting
Andrew,okay so the list of currently Released Movies we need to watch in Order is...
Andrew,"Captain America 1

Andrew,I gotta go to work but legit think about it maybe over march break @The Rona
Andrew,not all in one day obv
Andrew,I'm down
Andrew,yo lit
Andrew,ill try and figure out which ones are on netflix and which ones ill need to pirate
Andrew,bad
Andrew,???
Andrew,Pirating things is wrong
Andrew,it is stealing
Andrew,and if everyone did it no more movies would be made
Andrew,just think about that
Andrew,http://puu.sh/ujKXT/d8381d16a8.jpg
Andrew,and by pirating something when not everyone else does it is like saying you are better than them
Andrew,most things you dont even need to pirate
Andrew,you know photoshop?
Andrew,and other adobe products
Andrew,i have the files from adobe im using their files
Andrew,not third party
Andrew,i just know how to mess with the security on it and make my free trial go from lasting 7 days to 1000 days
Andrew,that is stealing and wrong
Andrew,no third party programs or software adobe jsut has really loose security for being such a large company
Andrew,thats on them
Andrew,if a store had no alarm system and just a bad lock would it be okay to steal from that store?
Andrew,no becuase that is stealing not pirating
Andrew,PIRACY IS STEALING
Andrew,there is no a finite amount of computer programs or files
Andrew,there is a finite amount of objects
Andrew,but you still obtain something without payment to the creator
Andrew,"Piracy is a Victimless Crime, Stealing is not."
Andrew,NO
Andrew,if you made something and everyone pirated it you would be very upset becasue you would make 0 MONEY
Andrew,"if its a small startup or something like and indie game/film from a small company i will pay for their products and support them if i think its worth my money, but if its a large company like Adobe or Marvel where my 1 Aquisition without payment will not affect them then i feel no shame in doing what i do"
Andrew,how can you even defend yourself? you know its illegal and wrong yet you try to come up with reasons why it is okay even though you know you wouldn't like it if someone pirated something you made
Andrew,Big companies deserve money for their work just as much as small ones
Andrew,im not trying to defend myself
Andrew,am i doing something illegal? yes.
Andrew,do i feel remorse? no.
Andrew,Piracy is Comparable to Jaywalking
Andrew,yeah its illegal but nobody cares
Andrew,that is so untrue
Andrew,@The Rona I mgiht be Busy March 11-15 but im free the other days of march break i believe
Andrew,@here games bois?
Andrew,maybe
Andrew,i'm kinda enjoying my pokemon and chill session ive got going on tho
Andrew,you should join me and chris for a pokemans nuzlocke challenge at some point
Andrew,Yo boyd
Andrew,In a work meeting
Andrew,I'm literally never not pirating something
Andrew,@SWIRL GIRL It's ok I support your pirating 110%
Andrew,thanks fam
Andrew,np
Andrew,"to put my two cents in about pirating, yeah it's illegal, yeah it's morally wrong, but it's prevelant enough that most companies work it into their assumptions about how much money they can make and at that point it's become so standard that it almost doesn't matter"
Andrew,but personally
Andrew,Sylki join so we can play my game when doctor comes back
Andrew,"I only pirate stuff like books I can get from the library but am too lazy to walk to, old games that I'd be getting second hand so the original creators don't make any money anyway, or software that I already own but it's on my old computer and a massive pain to transfer"
Andrew,doc is back btw
Andrew,and textbooks cause they're crazy overpriced and there's no way to know if you're actually gonna need them till like 1/3 of the way through the course
Andrew,also I'm busy and I'm not gonna be able to play tonight
Andrew,okay
Andrew,also how do you even pirate a textbook?

Andrew,Have you heard of M.C. Escher before Quick?
Andrew,He's the artist of that picture
Andrew,He has a whole bunch of stuff like that that breaks perspective and positioning and it's super neat
Andrew,I've only ever heard of him as the person who drew this picture
Andrew,I had never heard of him before now
Andrew,His stuff is pretty cool
Andrew,honestly he's one of my favourite artists
Andrew,he fiddles with the ways you have to draw to give the illusion of a third dimension in order to make trippy geometrically impossible pictures and they're always super interesting
Andrew,"so I'm studying for a test tomorrow, and the prof posts old tests, and when I was talking to one of my friends who took the course last year, they said this test was basically impossible and everyone did horribly, and I kinda throught they were exaggerating"

Andrew,Go-to play overwatch
Andrew,"What is this, a discord for owls?"
Andrew,On YouTube
Andrew,Send links
Andrew,wow the alt fire sounds super OP
Andrew,Yeah it does
Andrew,She look really good
Andrew,Also Bastion is getting a small nerf
Andrew,"Instead of 35% damage resistance, they are lowering it to 20%"
Andrew,Why do they gotta release the new hero when I have a test tomorrow ;-;
Andrew,I don't think its for a while yet
Andrew,Is just on ptr thou
Andrew,She's on the PTR
Andrew,The new hero sounds pretty bad
Andrew,How so?
Andrew,Her weapon slows her while firing
Andrew,Also abilities just sound kinda useless in general
Andrew,Non moving shields aren't that useful
Andrew,Because people move a lot in overwatch
Andrew,Fortify just sounds really dumb
Andrew,If you slow down whole shooting
Andrew,*while
Andrew,Thoughts? @The Rona
Andrew,How you gonna sit there and do my ass like that
Andrew,I don't think the slowing while firing matters too too much
Andrew,Especially since we don't know her damage right now
Andrew,Depending on the shield cool-down the non moving might not be a problem
Andrew,"The alt-fire seems pretty good, mini grav + hook, and it slows you"
Andrew,I have more too add but I am in chem right now
Andrew,I think that her abilities are counterproductive
Andrew,Shut up
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane The alt fire can be used to pull people off of high ground
Andrew,also dva slows down when she shoots and she's pretty good
Andrew,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Andrew,900
Andrew,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Andrew,900
Andrew,"So, her gun it pretty good"
Andrew,it's a bit weird tho
Andrew,looks like it should be hitscan
Andrew,isn't hitscan
Andrew,"Yeah, it's projectiles"
Andrew,seems strong tho
Andrew,"she could be good, we'll have to see"
Andrew,i like the gravity thing she has
Andrew,welp I was just on a team with a 76 and a mccree who couldn't kill their idiot pharah

Andrew,new hero?
Andrew,yee boy
Andrew,seems pretty cool. I could see playing her with mercy on defense instead of ana
Andrew,I'm pretty sure the damage boost from her ult doesn't stack with Mercy's
Andrew,that would make since
Andrew,I have a feeling she's going to be the go to second tank in a bastion meta
Andrew,esspecially on defense
Andrew,"I can see her + rein being really infuriating to deal with, cause you're got two decently sized shields with the whole team hiding behind them, if you get too close you have to deal with the rein hammer and if you stay far out you have to deal with her machine gun mowing people down"
Andrew,does her grav thing pull through shields?
Andrew,it goes through shields
Andrew,I don't think her gun has falloff damage
Andrew,"nah I mean if you detonate it in front of a shield, will it pull the people behind it?"
Andrew,it does for sure
Andrew,starts at like 25-30 meters
Andrew,wait
Andrew,maybe not
Andrew,I think it might pull through shields
Andrew,I'm pretty sure there is no falloff
Andrew,It's just her spread
Andrew,spread gets crazy there though
Andrew,making you hit less
Andrew,I could see people getting crazy environmental kills with her grav though
Andrew,like indoor nepal
Andrew,I wonder if it pulls through walls
Andrew,like Zarya's graviton
Andrew,I dont think so
Andrew,it looks like it needs los
Andrew,You could use it on that wall on Lijang
Andrew,If it doesn't need los
Andrew,you wouldn't need the wall just shoot it off the stage and detonate it
Andrew,true
Andrew,Also I don't know if you guys know this but when she uses her fortify ability she gets a 50% damage resistance (I think)
Andrew,but that makes me think that it shouldn't be able to pull through shields

Andrew,new sm4sh tier list!
Andrew,ROB dropped 13 places
Andrew,rip
Andrew,gg ROB
Andrew,wait actually only 5
Andrew,was looking at the wrong old tier list
Andrew,Good mistake
Andrew,still he's now in the bottom half of the list
Andrew,why is sonic 5th
Andrew,there's like one player who does ok with sonic ever and he's actually a cloud main
Andrew,only 1.5 people do well with falco in melee and he is second
Andrew,1.5?
Andrew,mango is .5
Andrew,westballz is 1
Andrew,I see
Andrew,and even westballz uses fox for certain matchups
Andrew,so maybe 1.2?
Andrew,"TIL Samuel L Jackson likes anime

Andrew,Samuel L. Jackson Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions | WI...
Andrew,"yes, but there's a lot of decent falco players or players with decent falcos"
Andrew,you look at the top 50 or so players and there are a lot of falcos
Andrew,Isn't ppmd a good falco?
Andrew,"you look at sm4sh top 50, first sign of a sonic is at 12th, and the guy barely plays sonic anymore, instead focusing on cloud, and even then he doesn't have particularly good results"
Andrew,He's a Marth main yeah
Andrew,and the other 3 sonics in the top 50 never make top 8
Andrew,rarely make top 16
Andrew,"and yet he's over 4 characters who have won majors (mario, mewtwo, marth, zss)"
Andrew,also somehow bayo snuck out on top
Andrew,she's definately high/top tier but not the best in the game
Andrew,don't think bayo's ever done better than 4th or 5th at majors
Andrew,yeah her best ever result at a major (even pre-nerf) is 4th and somehow she's considered the best character in the game
Andrew,What is the criteria for the tier list  though?
Andrew,"it's also funny looking at this tier list in relation to kingston sm4sh, where, based on our current PR (which admittadly has some odd parts), from #1 down through the honourable mentions, we play 28th, 35th, 38th (working on switching to 4th), 36th, 17th, 40th, 7th/43rd (and he's far better at 43rd), 12th, 47th, 23rd/11th, and then honourable mentions play 12th/6th, 6th/37th, and 4th"
Andrew,everyone who plays a character in S or A tier (1-12) are all 7th or worse
Andrew,Your number 1 player plays DK?
Andrew,"I'm pretty sure the list is supposed to be based on how good the character is on paper, which imo is kind of dumb when in some cases there's little to no proof that they're that good in practice, and some characters who suck on paper have pretty good results"
Andrew,yeah DKBill
Andrew,"DK, Ike, Shulk (trying to get a sheik going), wario, villager, g&w, fox/little mac (way better at little mac, is gonna be climbing back up now that he's switched back), ryu, kirby, captain falcon/zss"
Andrew,"not counting the guy working on swtiching to sheik, our only person who plays an s-tier is an honourable mention"

Andrew,also you trusted smithy super hard and he was involved in every facist
Andrew,Kameron that was so terrible stop this
Andrew,you dont usually play this game straightfoward lmao
Andrew,Kameron you threw
Andrew,Eventually though if you play with enough people your goal is to categorize unknown players with know playstyles so saying you need to anticipate plaing with different people is a weak argument

Andrew,Why banished though?
Andrew,so I don't get Ava sick
Andrew,tell Ava to get bent
Andrew,pull rank on her
Andrew,you were there first
Andrew,wait you are older right?
Andrew,Ava and I hold the opinion that the sick person should concede their rights to the well person
Andrew,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring
Andrew,we have agreed on this in the past
Andrew,I must honor my agreement
Andrew,fair enough
Andrew,Are you one of those older child supremacists?
Andrew,are there any non-first-born older child supremacists?
Andrew,just out of curiostiy
Andrew,why not just not interact?
Andrew,Doubtful
Andrew,BECAUSE HE COUGHS IN THE AIR AND ITS
Andrew,yes there are sylki
Andrew,they are called the younger children
Andrew,that's like being a black white supremicist
Andrew,"Completely off topic, they are reverting the changes to Ana's heal grenade on the PTR"
Andrew,boooooooooooooooooooooooo
Andrew,And they are also removing the ability for Zen to apply discord orb through barriers
Andrew,that kinda makes sense
Andrew,nah im not an older child supremecist im actually the youngest in my family
Andrew,i just run the house
Andrew,then why did you need to mention that he is older?
Andrew,cause he should pull rank on you
Andrew,but he does not outrank me
Andrew,"I made a youtube banner for my friends channel, any feedback or changes i should make before sending it to her?"
Andrew,"nah, looks good"
Andrew,"make sure the ""art and animation"" part has the same sized margins as the name"
Andrew,cause right now they're tighter and it looks a bit odd
Andrew,other than that it's lookin good
Andrew,yeah thats my b I see it now too
Andrew,also might want to make it not italicized
Andrew,they were the same sized margins but then I made the aubtext italic so yeah forgot to account for that
Andrew,it's up to you but I'm personally a fan of consistancy with this sort of thing so I'd keep it non-italic
Andrew,well im using different fonts aswell for the titlw and subtext
Andrew,im trying to break them up
Andrew,I have no idea how it'd look but you might also want to try the same kind of text border thing you have going for hte main title on the subtitle
Andrew,"different fonts works, but I prefer to keep them in a similar theme"
Andrew,k thanks for the advice (not sarcasm)
Andrew,"cause already you have different size, positioning, and font, adding the italics is just a tad too much imo"
Andrew,"shrugs as always tho it's up to you, trust your own aesthetic sense"

Andrew,"A student who was born female felt perfectly comfortable identifying as a man at Wellesley College — until people said he shouldn’t be class diversity officer because he is now a white male. Timothy Boatwright was born a girl, and checked off the “female” box when applying to the Massachusetts all-women’s school, according to an article in the New York Times. But when he got there, he introduced himself as a “masculine-of-center genderqueer” person named “Timothy” (the name he picked for himself) and asked ..."

Andrew,cause I've been mostly watching sm4sh cause there's more strong players in the bracket

Andrew,prolly matchup familiarity?
Andrew,like he's just more comfortable fox vs falcon
Andrew,I don't think he's taken games with his sheik today
Andrew,yes he has
Andrew,"not sure tho, mostly been watching sm4sh"
Andrew,he took 1 vs shroomed
Andrew,and 1 vs hungry pidgeon
Andrew,shrugs no idea then
Andrew,whose your bet on the winner?
Andrew,hbox of course
Andrew,the safe pick
Andrew,his only threat is m2k
Andrew,no one else has even a small chance of beating him
Andrew,hasn't m2k been beating hbox lately?
Andrew,last set was summit where he lost
Andrew,but prior to that was a local where they traded sets
Andrew,could go either way
Andrew,no player other than m2k can beat hbox
Andrew,of moon and shroomed who do you think would do better if they make WF?
Andrew,I think shroomed would have a better chance against both m2k and hbox
Andrew,barring something insane (equivilant to that random wizzy over hbox) you're right
Andrew,but I'm just gonna sit here and hope for more upsets
Andrew,wizzy did it twice actually
Andrew,once was vs a broken finger hbox though
Andrew,I thought Armada was the best tho
Andrew,"I woulnd't be super surprised if there were more upsets, it's been a fairly upset heavy tourney, in both games"

Andrew,"Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world. Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves. All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people.

- George Bernard Shaw"
Andrew,"Just playing devils advocate, based on his statement, stability and not being an asshole are the sole domain of the reasonable"
Andrew,Which makes this a shaky argument for the unreasonable unless he enforced the importance of both
Andrew,And you just didn't include the whole quote
Andrew,"I think what is meant by this is that the people who ask ""so why isn't that possible"" are the unreasonable people because most people just accept it can't be done"
Andrew,that is all of the quote I was given
Andrew,if there is more that is my schools fault for not including the rest
Andrew,Fair enough
Andrew,I took it as a quote encouraging innovation and asking questions
Andrew,which is something I appreciate
Andrew,Based on the adapt to the world/adapt the world phrasing I think my point about the importance of both stands
Andrew,I don't believe there is more to the quote
Andrew,Adapting the world to you is the same as creating things to make your life easier
Andrew,like making AC
Andrew,the world is now whatever temperature I want
Andrew,boom
Andrew,Because if everyone tried to change the world to suit them we'd have a mess if t weren't for those who adapt to maintain it
Andrew,world adapted
Andrew,that is why most people are born with no sense of doing and are lazy
Andrew,almost no one actually cares
Andrew,Symbiotic n stuff
Andrew,those who adapt to the world are mere followers
Andrew,they can never make a difference
Andrew,See a lot of you guys are very ambitious and want to have a huge impact with your job
Andrew,Whereas all I really want is to get a good blue collar job
Andrew,Not some field where I am a pioneer and I have to create and research new things
Andrew,to each their own
Andrew,"I'm not attacking the ones who make a difference, I'm just saying that both types are needed for those differences to become a part of a stable society"
Andrew,You can't lead if everyone is a leader
Andrew,true
Andrew,I can lead but honestly I'd rather have my job clearly set out for me
Andrew,but I believe that people are born in a proportion to what is needed by intelligent design
Andrew,I get the work done and go home
Andrew,"I'm reminded of a school trip I took back in middle school, at one point we had a motivational speaker talking to us, and he did a little ""repeat after me"" thing, going through stuff like ""I will live my life to its fullest"", ""I won't back down from a challenge"", etc, but then at one point he goes ""I will lead not follow"" and the whole room repeats this, with me and a friend just silently looking at each other and trying not to crack up"
Andrew,"Most people are content as or would rather be followers, even if they'd say otherwise if you asked them"
Andrew,that is accurate
Andrew,see opinion above
Andrew,"This was mostly in agreement with that (not a personal believer in intelligent design, but with the rest of it)"
Andrew,"Personally, if the person I'm following is doing a better job than I could I'm fine not being in charge but if not Ill usually take charge"
Andrew,The only issue with being a follower is making sure you are following the right leadee
Andrew,"Which was a bitch for group projects in high school, where in my friend group I was at the top end of the bottom half, in terms of organization/leadership ability, so I'd always get stuck wrangling my super lazy/disorganized friends"
Andrew,Sounds like every group project I've been in 
Andrew,never done a group project but they sound horrible
Andrew,They are
Andrew,"Or consider our old tf2 team, where I main called for most of it just because I had more experience than you guys, despite not being a particularly great main caller and much preferring to manage a smaller chunk of the team (as roamer or scout I normally micromanage the flank, or as med usually just the combo) and let someone else handle the main strats"
Andrew,us people who actually care get killed by those who are okay with a C
Andrew,Any decent teacher groups you with people at your grade level or lets you choose your own groups
Andrew,And the rare group projects with a good group are glorious
Andrew,It's so dumb cause most teachers at my school assign groups
Andrew,"One history project though I got the best group ever, like they were down to work on it outside of school and we ended up getting a 100% on it"
Andrew,"Also, as a brief aside, some people who are happy with a C care quite a bit but just aren't equipped to do better (and yes they still drag you down but not for lack of caring)"
Andrew,@Sak von Sak I invented a new melee crew battle format
Andrew,it involves two teams of 6

Andrew,it's basically just that I ate lunch at 4 and I've been snacking all day so I'm completely not hungry
Andrew,and as a result don't have the energy for actual food
Andrew,Poor Sylki and his poptarts
Andrew,what flavor poptarts though

Andrew,"lololololol apparently our premier (the person in charge of provincial-level governemtn, don't know what the US equivilant would be, governer maybe?) only has a 12% approval rating"
Andrew,lol what a loser
Andrew,Bush had a higher approval rating than that
Andrew,"and I don't even know what she did wrong, I've heard of no controversial bills, no scandals, no one expressing a particular dislike, nothing"
Andrew,fake news?
Andrew,but clearly something has gone horribly wrong
Andrew,maybe she isn't disliked that much
Andrew,"I'm assuming that yeah, she's not the target of strong dislike, just not many people particularly like her"
Andrew,alternatively since it's provincial level I just haven't heard much cause it's smaller scale
Andrew,but DAMN 12% approval rating is awful
Andrew,What's her name?
Andrew,kathleen wynne
Andrew,or something like that

Andrew,there are big melee tourneys this weekend
Andrew,but nope he's going to a sm4sh tournament
Andrew,he just got basically jv3'd by a top 20 player
Andrew,he only technically didn't jv3 him cause he took 1 damage from being too far offscreen while killing bizz
Andrew,does he play ganon?

Andrew,edgy long hair swordsmen?
Andrew,i'd believe it
Andrew,somehow neither of them is edgy in game
Andrew,boi dunban is extra edgy
Andrew,hello???
Andrew,how is he edgy?
Andrew,other than that he's metal af
Andrew,err sorry not dunban i'm dumb
Andrew,the other one is edgy
Andrew,I mean I only just met him
Andrew,he doesn't seem that edgy
Andrew,dunban is not that edgy in fairness
Andrew,oh oops no spoiling then
Andrew,uh oh
Andrew,suddenly very worried
Andrew,ts nothing major just he becomes more edgy later on
Andrew,aight
Andrew,dunban is super metal tho
Andrew,at least at the start
Andrew,oh yeah totally
Andrew,but he becomes less edgy as it goes on
Andrew,"man burns out all the nerves in one arm fighting the good fight, waits a year, then comes right back in fighting with the other arm and giving zero fucks"
Andrew,man runs straight down a cliff
Andrew,yeah and then it turns out he's the mentor character like
Andrew,
Andrew,yup
Andrew,the other dude (lao?) is kinda like the opposite
Andrew,@Zain what was network id and passowrd
Andrew,starts out chill and develops the badass/edgy-ness?
Andrew,yeah basically
Andrew,lao's got nuts dps
Andrew,also true
Andrew,"for a sniper dude who keeps going ""it's not my forte, but..."" every time I go for melee combos he's got some damn good melee arts"
Andrew,and that one art that buffs everyone's ranged stuff is so good
Andrew,especially when my main character does giant laser beams
Andrew,yeah lao is super good at the point where you first get to use him
Andrew,its been to fucking long since i played x tho liek actually
Andrew,I just got it a few days ago
Andrew,thus far loving it
Andrew,i played it on release which was like a few years ago i think
Andrew,yeah I was hoping the price would go down before I got it
Andrew,its a great game tho
Andrew,ran out of patience
Andrew,oh unlucky
Andrew,Lin is such a good character
Andrew,shame her design is super uncanny valley and all
Andrew,just remember she's 13
Andrew,"""13"""
Andrew,yeah I know
Andrew,I'm not saying she's attractive
Andrew,she's just really funny
Andrew,no i'm just making fun of the super young tech nerd cliche but she's a well developed character
Andrew,and she's also funny which is nice
Andrew,there's something just.... off... about her model
Andrew,it's super unsettling and I can't put my finger on it
Andrew,she has bug eyes curved downward which make her look a little off sometimes
Andrew,that might be it
Andrew,the characters have fairly normal eyes but lin has really big eyes in comparison
Andrew,I mean I gave my character purple and teal cat eyes and it's somehow less unsettling
Andrew,(also don't ask how purple and teal work together but somehow they do)
Andrew,idk mans
Andrew,Still the greatest sin this game has is not allowing us to play as Tatsu
Andrew,noooo tatsu's annoying
Andrew,never been a fan of the nopon
Andrew,we need to successor to the heropon
Andrew,didn't really like riki either
Andrew,riki was hype
Andrew,he's comic relief and occasional emotional crutch for melia and beyond that he serves no purpose
Andrew,reyn and riki together made it much better
Andrew,and he's not even a good party member
Andrew,Wait that's actually not true riki is easily one of the better ones
Andrew,really? I never figured out how to make him any good
Andrew,he's a magic tank and he's got like half the statuses
Andrew,yeah but he can't draw aggro
Andrew,so being a tank is useless
Andrew,he focuses on statusing
Andrew,statuses draw aggro i believe
Andrew,moreso than big damage
Andrew,I could never get him to hold aggro
Andrew,dunno
Andrew,its nbd unless you're going for like max difficulty runs or something
Andrew,shrugs he never did any work for me
Andrew,best party for me was dunban fiora sharla
Andrew,mad jukes and on the offchance you get hit sharla's got your back
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,dunban fiora melia is good for most of the game up until you start hitting frequent enemies with strong AoE that just kills melia without her even having aggro
Andrew,i kinda gave up on sharla because overheating is a terrible mechanic
Andrew,just never play as sharla and you won't notice
Andrew,no i notices because she just doesnt do anything
Andrew,and she eventually gets a skill that halves the time it takes
Andrew,yeah but by then i could just use melia
Andrew,eh she just has less overall healing
Andrew,yeah but she's got more than enough damage to make up for it
Andrew,and in the late game stuff gets AoE that can one shot her without her having aggro and without getting a vision
Andrew,and then once you revive her it takes ages to get heals back up properly
Andrew,reyn melia shulk/dunban is  how i went most of the game
Andrew,yeah that's true
Andrew,how on earth did you run reyn melia? melia never seems to give enough heals to sustain him at all
Andrew,if the enemies were being aoe happy i'd just play her and play super conservatively
Andrew,also can we talk about how shit melia's AI is?
Andrew,absolutely
Andrew,its terrible
Andrew,"if you've got melia in the party, you play melia"
Andrew,also sustaining reyn wasn't that bad
Andrew,skyfactoryfb
Andrew,what elementals did you use?
Andrew,"melia had slow heals but she did work, and whenever i ran shulk we had monado shield and stuff too"
Andrew,I mean melia's great for 4/5 of the time she's in the party
Andrew,I hoenstly don't even remember its been way too longs since I played chronicles
Andrew,actually what i think i did was
Andrew,i'd healing gift and then hide int he back with water elemental
Andrew,and then just try and pooke with fire and electric
Andrew,huh I did basically the same
Andrew,but it seemed like healing gift couldn't really keep up
Andrew,yeah sometimes reyn would get low so i'd have to burn a water discharge
Andrew,it seemed like the main issue was just the cooldown
Andrew,shrugs
Andrew,melia dunban was nuts tho
Andrew,i dont remember the specifics my last full playthrough of chronicles was easily over three years ago
Andrew,especially if you did water+lightning+wind and he just gets even more agility
Andrew,dunban made me feel guilty using him lmao

Andrew,2GGaming Playing Super Smash Bros. for Wii U - Twitch Clips
Andrew,2GGC: Civil War - Climax - Clipped by Booyahman
Andrew,doesn't show the end of the match but it was just a random bair at like 140
Andrew,isn't samus bad?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,also doesn't esam play pikachu?
Andrew,but pika mario is apparently one of the worst high tier matchups in the game
Andrew,"the terrible high tier mus are diddy > ryu, mario > pika, um"
Andrew,apparently meta knight > rosa but I have no idea why
Andrew,this would be like a hype mango vs armada themed tournament and hbox just wins
Andrew,rosa > ness might be the worst matchup in any smash game
Andrew,"this would be like, if at G3 mango went out to like abate and armada lost to like.... scar"
Andrew,wow that extreme?
Andrew,I have never heard of the guy who knocked zero out
Andrew,then again he made top 96 so maybe a bit better
Andrew,it'd be like if armada lost to trillium
Andrew,or homemadewaffles
Andrew,that would be super funny
Andrew,the quivilant for armada to lose to like melee esam and then trillium
Andrew,and then for mango to lose to like mafia and abate
Andrew,who was ally's first loss?
Andrew,trela
Andrew,he's somewhere in the 40s I think
Andrew,character?
Andrew,ryu
Andrew,oh actually he's 25th
Andrew,what
Andrew,oh it's almost a year outdated
Andrew,was looking at the older rankings
Andrew,trela's 42nd
Andrew,"so if I'm gonna follow exact rankings, mang0 lost to Abu and Dizzkidboogie playing dk"
Andrew,"actually going by position in the tier list, dkb's zelda"
Andrew,and neither of the people zero lost to are ranked so I dunno how to compare it
Andrew,there's also a link guarunteed at least 9th
Andrew,that's the equivilant of a DK being guarunteed 9th at the most stacked melee tournament you've ever seen

Andrew,this falcon player is by far the most fun to watch player I've ever seen in smash 4
Andrew,dunno why they're outside
Andrew,but yeah fatality's a crowd favourite for a reason
Andrew,these are my two favourite players
Andrew,I still want nairo to win tho

Andrew,wow 3-0 comeback
Andrew,hooooooly shit
Andrew,fatality is soooo nuts
Andrew,that pop off too
Andrew,he's so hyped
Andrew,that set was insane
Andrew,that might have been the best set I've seen all year
Andrew,that was also a really short set
Andrew,is smash 4 usually that fast?
Andrew,like games end quickly
Andrew,nope
Andrew,that's basically the peak of aggro play in sm4sh
Andrew,if only the whole game was like that
Andrew,"fastest players you're likely to see are nairo, fatality, SuperGirlKels (tho she's lower level), esam's pika, larry lurr"
Andrew,also marss
Andrew,forgot about marss
Andrew,what about hax
Andrew,sm4sh
Andrew,not melee
Andrew,only problem with fatality is he's really bad at slowing it down when he needs to
Andrew,even if someone's doing a great job walling him out he'll keep bashing his head against it
Andrew,@The Rona
Andrew,I found the mythical 8
Andrew,woah
Andrew,"commentators currently discussing whether to call the mewtwo combo abandango invented ""The Aba-combo"" or ""The Combo-dango"""
Andrew,aba combo is better
Andrew,^
Andrew,I'm partial to the combo-dango
Andrew,that one kinda sounds inappropriate
Andrew,so?
Andrew,it's so much more fun to say
Andrew,esports needs to be esports
Andrew,aba-combo is easier to say
Andrew,"various sm4sh combos are commonly called ""The hoo-hah"", ""The ding-dong"", ""The beep-boop"", etc."
Andrew,"I agree, and it sounds better"
Andrew,aba-combo
Andrew,we don't do legit sounding names of things
Andrew,"I'm not sure if you guys have heard how abadango is pronounced, but the dango part sounds pretty similar to combo"
Andrew,it basically ends up sounding like combo-dongo
Andrew,which is why it's easy to replace dango with combo
Andrew,shrugs
Andrew,still more fun to say
Andrew,but I'll agree to disagree
Andrew,also I kinda just hate you so you know
Andrew,kinda have to disagree
Andrew,
Andrew,DK IN TOP 8
Andrew,another top 10 player out
Andrew,7/10 have been eliminated
Andrew,"only one in top 8 thus far, two of them are in losers"
Andrew,wow
Andrew,I was watching the DK set
Andrew,DK's duuuuumb
Andrew,that MU looks brutal tho
Andrew,cause sheik has such a hard time killing
Andrew,and DK's so heavy and he's never gonna let her get rage
Andrew,I don't think mr r got over 100% that whole set
Andrew,if you're still watching witness my least favourite character
Andrew,fuck ryu
Andrew,why?
Andrew,"man has a kill confirm at like 65-90 (rage dependant) off uptilt or downtilt, both of which are somewhere between frame 1-3"
Andrew,plus it's safe on shield
Andrew,and he's super heavy so he always gets a ton of rage
Andrew,he has a fast shield breaker so you can't just shield
Andrew,on bigger characters (like ROB) he can nairplane you across the stage into a spike
Andrew,he has a cancellable super-armour move
Andrew,that is also a free setup into his best kill move (aka you die at like 65 if he's got rage)
Andrew,rob even has a decent matchup against ryu (pretty close to 50/50 imo) but he's just such a pain to fight against
Andrew,"cause ryu has trouble approaching through projectiles, but he touches you and you're boned"
Andrew,nairo why would you go to T&C and give ryu a lower cieling
Andrew,you have to play so campy against ryu and it's so boring and also terrifying
Andrew,noooooo fuck ryu
Andrew,8/10 of the top ten eliminated before top 8
Andrew,"silver lining, canada made top 8"
Andrew,but ugh fuck ryu
Andrew,9/10
Andrew,9/10 of the top ten out before top eight
Andrew,what the hell
Andrew,4/5 of the top 5 out
Andrew,jesus christ
Andrew,who is the one still in?
Andrew,dabuz
Andrew,#4
Andrew,My personal pick for who I want to win is captain zack because bayo is super cool
Andrew,or fatality
Andrew,hhahahaha clearly you've never fought a bayo
Andrew,no I never play this game
Andrew,yeah I know
Andrew,cool to watch
Andrew,like falco
Andrew,falco is super bad in smash 4
Andrew,too bad
Andrew,I'm cheering for fatality or marss
Andrew,"safe money is on dabuz, kirihara, or captain zack"
Andrew,"but then again, safe bets have very much not prevailed this tournament"
Andrew,at the same time it'd be so sick to see T or Hikaru win for the low tiers
Andrew,it'd be like DK or Yoshi winning evo for melee
Andrew,are they in the same approximate place on the tier list or same level of viability because I don't think that those two things are equal comparing smash 4 and melee
Andrew,approximate tier list placement
Andrew,basically just did ((sm4sh tier list placement) / (number of characters in sm4sh)) * (number of characters in melee) and rounded it
Andrew,but honestly in terms of viability it wouldn't be much different
Andrew,then again I guess you could argue that this shakes things up (ie if they're making top 8 clearly they're underrated on the tier list and in general considerations of their viability)
Andrew,"to summarize, you see why I don't feel like I'm handicapping myself by playing 33rd on the tier list?"
Andrew,"I made it on one team, but I have another tryout later"
Andrew,gg
Andrew,where is my mans @Mr. Airplane
Andrew,@Max if you're not still watching we're in top 8
Andrew,I'm watching
Andrew,what is it with japanese players and covering their faces?
Andrew,it's a thing you do when you're sick
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,kids at my school do it
Andrew,thats nice
Andrew,"or if people aroudn you are, and I'm assuming they're all mostly staying together so if one of them's sick they're all gonna cover up"
Andrew,well the ones from most Asain countries that is
Andrew,also captain zack's american
Andrew,oh really?
Andrew,rip i wanted to watch top 8
Andrew,just physicall y janapense
Andrew,but now I have csgo stuff
Andrew,"even though I'm not a fan of bayo, I'm still cheering for captain zack cause I really want to see someone who's never won a major win the most stacked sm4sh tourney to date"
Andrew,I don't like bayo either
Andrew,so unless they fight each other I'm cheering against dabuz and kirihara
Andrew,that combo was lit though
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,I'm a little behind you
Andrew,should be caught up now
Andrew,what character is that little doll that dabuz has with him?
Andrew,I don't like bayo but I do like the way captain zack plays
Andrew,I missed it I dunno
Andrew,description?
Andrew,pink hair yellow and black outfit
Andrew,it will probably show up again
Andrew,shrugs I'll keep an eye out
Andrew,same color scheme as his rosa skin
Andrew,but with pink hair?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,no idea what the doll is
Andrew,dabuz has the freest bracket tho
Andrew,he's basically guarunteed 2nd
Andrew,I wonder if links super lame style or falcons super fast style will be the dominant style of this match
Andrew,T's actually pretty aggro for a link
Andrew,but that's till not that aggro
Andrew,my guess is that Link's gonna dictate the pace just cause it's Fatality
Andrew,man has no chill
Andrew,but it might not matter
Andrew,we shall see
Andrew,see? link's not that lame
Andrew,I used to play a lot of link
Andrew,wouldn't mind seeing him win
Andrew,I'm still cheering for fatality
Andrew,even if T might be better against dabuz
Andrew,cause a) fatality's awesome and b) rosa link would be soooo slow
Andrew,do bombs have kill potential?
Andrew,sort of
Andrew,bombs themselves don't kill
Andrew,but they can set up into kills
Andrew,T's nuts
Andrew,T's nuts
Andrew,fucking insane
Andrew,true
Andrew,what % chance would you give him vs dabuz?
Andrew,I have no idea what the matchup's like
Andrew,hm
Andrew,70-30 in dabuz's favour
Andrew,maybe 65-35
Andrew,"I can see the sword being able to contest rosa's range, but then also link can't cover his landings with dair cause rosa's up air is so disjoined"
Andrew,I wonder if bombs on shield will mess with luma
Andrew,I honestly have no idea how the matchup's gonna go
Andrew,the more I think the better it seems for T
Andrew,"dabuz is a studier and a learner, and I'm gonna assume he didn't really look at T or Link"
Andrew,I'm gonna end at 60-40 dabuz
Andrew,my god zack what was that combo
Andrew,that was disgusting
Andrew,and why are you surprised they ranked this character first?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,due to the lack of results
Andrew,I don't think it's reasonable to say someone's the best character when none of the best players play them
Andrew,think about the last 2 years of melee. the top fox placing in a tournament is usually 2nd or 3rd while peach's is 1st and fox is still ranked 5 places higher
Andrew,and she may have mad punishes but she loses some pretty key matchups and can struggle to approach (did you see how much trouble he was having getting anything started on dabuz)
Andrew,I'm not saying you should do it purely by player ranking
Andrew,but it's definately a way to get a partial judgement
Andrew,"the fact that there's only one puff and one peach in the top 20 or so (I forget where macD is, possibly top 30) should tell you that they aren't as good as their best players make them look"
Andrew,whereas there's a ton of fox
Andrew,or the characters are seen as boring by the general public so the people attempting to play them are much fewer in number
Andrew,which is actually true
Andrew,if you look at the distribution of mains
Andrew,oh my goodness the disrespect
Andrew,CZ gives no fucks about his opponants' feelings
Andrew,zero fucks whatsoever
Andrew,I missed it what happened?
Andrew,"taunted in game, taunted in real life"
Andrew,he's taunted so many times
Andrew,fthrow taunt is a true combo
Andrew,is her taunt an attack?
Andrew,no
Andrew,he just throws people and then taunts
Andrew,let's goooo fatality
Andrew,that was probably a hype set too bad I missed it
Andrew,I saw the final kill
Andrew,and thats it
Andrew,fatality's nuts
Andrew,kirihara almost reverse 3-0'd him
Andrew,and then fatality turned up out of nowhere in the last 30 seconds or so
Andrew,@everyone anyone want to play secret hitler tonight
Andrew,maybe
Andrew,depends how long this tourney goes
Andrew,cause this might be the hypest sm4sh tourney I've ever seen
Andrew,I agree with that because I find it interesting and i usually don't care to watch smash 4
Andrew,a lot of unexpected aggro players doing really well
Andrew,I'm hoping the meta evolves this way in the future
Andrew,so apparently T has beaten kirihara (the other best rosa) so he might have a chance here
Andrew,how much money does the winner get?
Andrew,not sure
Andrew,not something I really pay attention to
Andrew,did you see how much shield damage that fair did? that's like half the shield
Andrew,"on an unrelated note, kingston sm4sh discord has seen the return of our most cancerous community member"
Andrew,haven't seen him since last year
Andrew,the most toxic person I've ever talked to
Andrew,the guy who basically stole from me
Andrew,"he hosted a tourney at his house, I knocked him out at 4th, got 3rd, he declared only top 2 get money, then on the drive home (with 1st and 2nd) they counted their money and there a chunk missing"
Andrew,and now he's back and already trying to start shit
Andrew,just kick him from the discord then
Andrew,if everyone agrees he is toxic
Andrew,except not everyone does
Andrew,and he's surprisingly good friends with one of our community leaders
Andrew,and the guy who owns the discord
Andrew,also I don't want to start shit with him
Andrew,and there are even people who argue that the trash talk and stuff is good for the community
Andrew,"""your popoff sucks"""
Andrew,from the crowd
Andrew,lololol
Andrew,everyone hates dabuz for some reason
Andrew,I love kingston sm4sh discord tho
Andrew,"one guy (actually the melee zelda main) comments that, while he doesn't have a winning record against a lot of people, he couldn't think of anyone in the discord that he hasn't beaten"
Andrew,then out of nowhere
Andrew,"top player in ottawa shows up like ""yo what up?"" and has apparently been here for like half an hour just watching the conversation"
Andrew,top tier lurking
Andrew,what I want to see more than almost anything right now is fatality to 3-0 zack then give him the irl show me your moves
Andrew,but I don't think he's that mean
Andrew,let's gooooo fatality
Andrew,that was crazy good
Andrew,fatality's nuts
Andrew,you almost got to see the fatality combo but T was juuuuust too low percent
Andrew,that stomp footstool stomp footstool thing?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,so good
Andrew,fatality in grands let's gooooooo
Andrew,if he wins that would be so hype
Andrew,he could do it
Andrew,hard but doable
Andrew,this guy makes smash 4 interesting to watch
Andrew,these commentators are too loud
Andrew,DMs ARE A THING
Andrew,USE THEM
Andrew,there used to be three of us watching
Andrew,sorry
Andrew,@here overwatch?
Andrew,@Max almost done with tourney?
Andrew,possibly
Andrew,could be anywhere from one to seven more games
Andrew,*one to eight
Andrew,no one to seven
Andrew,I have not finished my placements
Andrew,I'm bad at math
Andrew,can't play comp with you
Andrew,booooo
Andrew,fatality lost
Andrew,it was so close but that early kill in the last game ate all his momentum
Andrew,still crazy that he got 2nd
Andrew,who won the whole thing?
Andrew,dabuz
Andrew,ah
Andrew,"I am 57,358 of all faceit users"
Andrew,"out of the 200,000 some that play"
Andrew,VP just went 2-13 at half to overtime now
Andrew,what map?
Andrew,train
Andrew,isn't train pretty one sided? didn't we do a similar thing the one time we played train?
Andrew,eh it can be
Andrew,where we got destroyed CT and then did pretty well on T?
Andrew,but still
Andrew,13-2
Andrew,still impressive
Andrew,both teams destroyed ct side though
Andrew,shrugs

Andrew,Competitive overwatch: episode 1
Andrew,so apparently back in the '90s my university's student government had a 3-hour debate on whether or not to approve a campus Star Trek club because their constitution had a policy banning Klingons from being club members which the student government thought failed to promote equality
Andrew,wat
Andrew,http://kingstonherald.com/news/klingon-equity-queens-university-2010310319
Andrew,"Klingon ""Equity"" Cited in Free Speech Grade for Queen's Universi..."
Andrew,"AMS ""Student Union actions & practices"" gets a B in national report"
Andrew,and yes that is a picture of a klingon photoshopped onto a picture of part of our campus
Andrew,@Sak von Sak Thats super dumb
Andrew,who cares
Andrew,that's a good question
Andrew,really funny tho
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,also proof that it's not just millenials who do weird things in the name of equality
Andrew,in your country it started much earlier
Andrew,oh don't give me that
Andrew,I'm sure if you dug around the states you'd find stuff
Andrew,yes
Andrew,but you guys have been more progressive from farther back in time
Andrew,"yeah, but I don't really qualify this as ""progressive"""
Andrew,"more as ""slightly insane"""
Andrew,its progressivism taken too far
Andrew,although from the article I gather the issue was more about that other actually exclusive clubs could crop up using this as a precedent
Andrew,oh that makes sense
Andrew,"I mean I feel like it'd be pretty easy to make an argument against that working (""banning a fictional group is very different than banning an actual one, doesn't count as a precedent"") but at this level stuff like this has some legal standing so I can understand the caution and not wanting to have to have that argument"
Andrew,My mic wasn't working
Andrew,I'm pretty sure sm4sh wario mains have some of the best tags around
Andrew,when I was in quebec over the summer there was a guy whose tag was WAHrrior and apparently there's some guy whose tag is EnigWAH
Andrew,r/place has ended ;-;
Andrew,"so I had this bright idea that cause I'm feeling pretty stressed I'm gonna work while listening to the upbeat/relaxing chunks of the chrono cross ost, and now I'm stuck cause I really just want to go play chrono cross and if there's one thing I really don't have time for it's a ~60 hour rpg"

Andrew,I just got called the king of organic chemistry by my teacher
Andrew,my part of the term project is done and the course with the assignment I'm donig well enough that I can just not do this assignment and focus on the test (which is worth a much larger chunk of my mark for that course)
Andrew,"and then I just have two more assignments, a test, and exams (one of which I'm horribly behind in the class and I'm gonna have to go in for a ton of help, but I've got time)"

Andrew,@Bitmin
Andrew,Anyone wanna play RoA?

Andrew,I feel so bad for you
Andrew,Thanks me too
Andrew,it's the first week since november that we've had decent weather and I'm too busy to go out and enjoy it
Andrew,glances outside oh hey it's started raining maybe being in here's not so bad
Andrew,@here how's the new update?
Andrew,its too cool for you
Andrew,I'm too cool for this update
Andrew,its pretty lit
Andrew,the uprising event takes a while tho
Andrew,I'm so bummed out rn
Andrew,don't be
Andrew,like its just a few cool skins
Andrew,and new lore stuff
Andrew,I don't like going on vacation
Andrew,^
Andrew,like just over a 100 pieces of new content
Andrew,it's boring
Andrew,honestly
Andrew,Vacations are exhausting
Andrew,vacations are supposed to be relaxing are u ok
Andrew,Home is relaxing
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane games are relaxing
Andrew,@bois
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,lets play the new update
Andrew,@Feral Nebula
Andrew,"@Mr. Airplane I started learning C#, very interesting!!!"
Andrew,if you want to play join a channel
Andrew,@Trapezoider
Andrew,I don't know C# at all @Trapezoider
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane Rip dweeb
Andrew,wait where did everyone go
Andrew,@Zain
Andrew,What is everyone doing in here? @here
Andrew,nothing really
Andrew,just playing the new update
Andrew,Am sad
Andrew,yuuuuus my linalg prof is so good
Andrew,he just put up what every single question on the exam is going to be (not the specific numbers and graphs but what they're gonna be)
Andrew,this is so helpful
Andrew,linalg?
Andrew,Good guy professor
Andrew,linear algebra
Andrew,super neat math stuff
Andrew,Today Ava and trap are going to play a best of 5 rivals set to see who is better
Andrew,ooh ooh tell me before it happens I want to watch
Andrew,Gg
Andrew,alright
Andrew,I swear the math profs at queens are all so good
Andrew,"best profs I've had these two years have been differential+integral calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math (only in second year, first year discrete math the prof was pretty bad)"
Andrew,so math profs are pretty good then I guess
Andrew,it's a pretty well funded department cause it overlaps with so many other ones so I assume they can afford really good ones
Andrew,"but they're all really good at explaining stuff, have tons of office hours if you need to go in for help, do extra help stuff for tests and exams, have really comprehensive online resources, etc etc etc"
Andrew,and as good as it is I kinda wish the prof quality was spread a little more evenly cause some profs suuuuuuck
Andrew,possibly the most frustrating is this one guy who's a top guy in his field (his field is pretty specific) but he just can't teach it for shit
Andrew,sad
Andrew,If anyone was wondering
Andrew,
Andrew,ABSA IS BAD !?
Andrew,Every character is close I just think absa is the worst
Andrew,still totally viable
Andrew,loud crying
Andrew,just my opinion

Andrew,"XD If you have fun with it, get good and be the best"

Andrew,Also I have an exam in five and a half hours and I'm wide awake

Andrew,that sucks
Andrew,sadbois
Andrew,  
Andrew,@Sak von Sak I learned a shadow combo
Andrew,nice nice
Andrew,need to make sure I can do it both ways now
Andrew,as in both directions
Andrew,yeah that's always important
Andrew,Good I can
Andrew,Fight?
Andrew,working on packing and cleaning right now
Andrew,maybe later tonight
Andrew,okay
Andrew,Random question
Andrew,http://www.strawpoll.me/12830647
Andrew,Which would you rather have control the world?
Andrew,Vote Now! [Nazi Germany] [Communist USSR] 
Andrew,"I mean, seeing as I'm jewish this is a pretty easy question"
Andrew,I'm assuming that very few of us are jews but for you yes its a no brainer
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane @waowder wanna do some lockeed practice at around 8:30ish
Andrew,@Rotomotorz  im down
Andrew,sure
Andrew,@waowder
Andrew,yo
Andrew,http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Codequest+2016+problems
Andrew,LMGTFY
Andrew,"so I'm skimming parts of the xenoblade x soundtrack, there is a song that is actually just called ""z37b20a13t01t08le"""
Andrew,What???
Andrew,I HAVE NO IDEA
Andrew,by the way new sg character should be fully practiced and ready in a few days
Andrew,nice nice
Andrew,you're probably gonna surpass me soon
Andrew,nah
Andrew,I don't have any characters that are actually good other than double
Andrew,I thought ms fortune was a good character
Andrew,I'm not good with her tho
Andrew,oh I see
Andrew,also airdash cancling is super easy
Andrew,grumbles
Andrew,you made it sound impossible
Andrew,I don't have the fast hands for it
Andrew,you just input a ground dash
Andrew,or I'm just doing something wrong mentally
Andrew,in the air
Andrew,tap foward twice
Andrew,then do a move
Andrew,yes but I can never seem to do it fast enough for the combo to keep going
Andrew,"maybe it's a tighter window on fortune than whoever you're learning (if it's not fortune I'd assume filia, but if it's fortune then I just don't have the hands for it)"
Andrew,maybe
Andrew,I'll have to try whatever combo your doing and see
Andrew,"I'm probably gonna drop fortune, focus on the parasoul (sure her combo's hard but I think with a bit more practice I'll be able to get it) plus I'm way more comfortable with her neutral and openers"
Andrew,I do not like fighting characters that outrange me by a significant degree
Andrew,this is why I need big band
Andrew,she's basically marth with samus missiles
Andrew,it's great
Andrew,so dumb
Andrew,I did a thing
Andrew,
Andrew,I am a totally different person without hair and it's kind of scary
Andrew,So did i
Andrew,lol what is that?
Andrew,Getting stitches soon
Andrew,No games 4 me

Andrew,"Most of my pc parts have been delivered, I'm just waiting on my case and operating system"

Andrew,The first one is always scary D:
Andrew,DONT WORK  ON CARPET DO IT ON A COUNTER

Andrew,you think this is a meme?
Andrew,the probably is there because I'm not sure I wanted to read that regardless of where it was
Andrew,triggered
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,is Sylki offended
Andrew,less by the content than the style and the intentional amount of cringe
Andrew,he tried to take credit for writing that
Andrew,I did?
Andrew,no trap
Andrew,I suck at green texts @Sak von Sak
Andrew,The only one I tried to write go no comments on 4 chan

Andrew,why dad
Andrew,kys
Andrew,it's fusion's server I think
Andrew,aye
Andrew,alright cool
Andrew,I thought it was chikons
Andrew,But then I realized he doesnt have the highest tier role
Andrew,I think old frostbite was
Andrew,also I'm pretty sure he's a master memer too
Andrew,:[
Andrew,also why do you want to be a master memer? what would you do with this untold power?
Andrew,Nothing I just want to be up there with you guys
Andrew,:[
Andrew,the only thing I've used it for is to add the  emote
Andrew,I would add a meme emote? and monitor the memes channel to ensure safety of users
Andrew,what meme would you use to encapsulate the entirety of meme-hood?
Andrew,Holy shit

Andrew,THe mightiest of all memes
Andrew,He only appears one in every 69^(infinity) memes
Andrew,I'll reserve judgement and leave it up to fusion
Andrew,@Zain
Andrew,I am the highest tier memer here
Andrew,"also I'm considering changing my tag for smash at least, should I go to Young Irish Stew or Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer?"
Andrew,Can I have a role that shows up above master memers that has no powers but says master master memers
Andrew,Y O U N G I R I S H S T E W
Andrew,! ! !
Andrew,@everyone I want an opinion
Andrew,I like Young Irish Stew
Andrew,Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer is a mouthful
Andrew,^
Andrew,Yung without an o
Andrew,just for the meme
Andrew,"if I do it like that I'd have to shorten every word a bit, I can't thing of a good way to shorten Irish and Stu will make people think that that's my name"
Andrew,I guess I could do Yung Irish Stoo
Andrew,but I don't think it's as good
Andrew,The other name is longer though
Andrew,How would you shorten it?
Andrew,probably just to Lermon Squerzer
Andrew,and the shortening of this one was to have consistency with Yung instead of Young
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane are you done building your comp

Andrew,I think they focused on the open world part way too much
Andrew,YES
Andrew,and there's a lot of random grinding for no reason
Andrew,I hate the fact that it is non linear
Andrew,it makes it hard to tell a good story and properly scale difficulty
Andrew,I keep running into enemies that kill me in one hit
Andrew,why
Andrew,git gud solved yo problem
Andrew,did you know that your opinion of open world games is negative does not mean the game is objectively bad
Andrew,^
Andrew,@Sak von Sak chill avec moi
Andrew,Young Irish Stew is typing...
Andrew,"For example, what you just described is part of what I like about xenoblade x - they tell you right out the gates that the world is incredibly hostile and you're constantly hearing about people getting attacked and killed by super strong monsters and then it happens to you and you're kinda like ""damn.  Fortunately unlike these sucker npcs I can revive at checkpoints"" and it adds to all the world building"
Andrew,"Also I can't right now, maybe later tonight"

Andrew,what
Andrew,I need this next year
Andrew,I don't remember exactly how it works but if you make an amazon account with a student email you can get free prime
Andrew,OP
Andrew,within canada at least
Andrew,so if any of you non-uni kids in canada want to order stuff off amazon you can probably do it through me (although paying me back would be complicated)
Andrew,"oh also of note, that free shipping is free ONE-DAY SHIPPING"
Andrew,woah
Andrew,Yeah just make an account with your student email
Andrew,free for a whole year
Andrew,pretty sure I've had it more than a year

Andrew,"toronto weather has gone from ""comfortably cool in jeans and a sweatshirt"" to ""sweating in shorts and a tshirt"" overnight"
Andrew,No kidding
Andrew,I was dying yesterday
Andrew,I was kinda hoping it'd be a one day thing but it seems like it's sticking around
Andrew,I feel no sympathy it's hot here all the time
Andrew,it's not so bad when you're used to it
Andrew,if it was this hot during the summer we wouldn't be complaining
Andrew,but it jumped twenty degrees celsius overnight and that's bullshit
Andrew,Around here this is basically considered part of summer
Andrew,We get summer weather from May to October
Andrew,"in fahrenheit, it went from 50 to 86 overnight"
Andrew,that's not ok
Andrew,86 is comforable
Andrew,I wish I had heat
Andrew,Comfortable*
Andrew,"86 is slightly too hot, but when you're not used to it it's brutal"
Andrew,also it's super humid
Andrew,Ideal to me is 78
Andrew,What humidity number is it?
Andrew,69%
Andrew,It's even worse when your AC isn't on
Andrew,ahahaha our AC's semi busted so it doesn't get everywhere in the house
Andrew,Okay I feel sorry for you guys now no ac is rough
Andrew,Rip
Andrew,fans have become a crucial commodity
Andrew,I'm so tired
Andrew,I fell asleep at like 3 last night
Andrew,So I drank a monster and i was good for a whilr
Andrew,But now I am tired again
Andrew,I'd say my perfect temperatures are 22 (72ish) or 13 (55ish) depending on what I'm doing
Andrew,also ouch
Andrew,just force yourself to stay up as long as you can
Andrew,Monsters are death in a bottle I would advise against drinking them
Andrew,Nah
Andrew,eh energy drinks are only bad if you drink like 5
Andrew,I mean I don't drink them every day
Andrew,admittadly I've never had energy drinks but so long as you don't go crazy with how many you drink and develop a dependancy you're fine
Andrew,same with coffee
Andrew,I know someone who drinks an energy drink every day and he just went to the dentist and apparently he has a cavity in every tooth
Andrew,"when my mum was in college she also worked a night shift, and they had a coffee machine with free coffee and one day she realized that she couldn't function without 13 cups of coffee"
Andrew,If I have lot of work to do sometimes I will get a drink with 6 shots of espresso 
Andrew,Little bit Overkill but it does the job
Andrew,I can stay up super late and focus with no assistance from coffee or monsters
Andrew,You also don't go to school
Andrew,Being social take a lot of energy
Andrew,"Patch Notes For 1.3
Time Counters- Name changed to charge counters.
Knight- Added to the game and ability changed from drawing cards upon killing a creature or hitting a player to paying 2 to draw a card.
Spirit- Removed from the game.
Anti-Mage, Spearman, Grand Arbiter, Stasis Chamber, Sage, Guardian, Blacksmith, Zombie, Sword, The Power of Time, Archives, Thundersurge, Dig, Poke, Silence, Foundry, and Forbid- Added to the game."
Andrew,The biggest MCG update yet
Andrew,2 new pages of cards
Andrew,"I can focus late without caffeine or energy drinks, but not for more than two, maybe three days in a row"
Andrew,also Octagon feeling the introvert struggle
Andrew,I feel your pain
Andrew,I'm not even an introvert
Andrew,It's just that being social is a lot of work
Andrew,that's the actual definition of introverted
Andrew,you can be a super social introvert
Andrew,it just takes a ton of your energy
Andrew,wanna play games?
Andrew,@here
Andrew,maybe later tonight
Andrew,@everyone Looking for beta testers for MCG 1.3 on tabletop simulator!

Andrew,@Mr. Airplane
Andrew,Can I get help with one permutations problem
Andrew,@everyone
Andrew,In how many orders can four students be lined up against a wall if there are six to choose from
Andrew,that makes no sense
Andrew,I think 6P4
Andrew,360?
Andrew,it's been awhile since I did permutations and combinations
Andrew,im so confused fml
Andrew,I think its 360
Andrew,"l;'kadfs;'klafds'lk;fkasd;'lk;l'afdsl;'kkl;'fadslk;'dfaskl;'rewqoip[reqwio[preqwio[prqewio[preqw[iopreqwio[pvcxzm,./cvxzmn.,cvzxnm,.zcvxnm.,zvc"
Andrew,if I remember correctly it's 6P4
Andrew,if that's an option on your calculator
Andrew,thats the equation for permuations taken at a time
Andrew,there should be an nPr thing
Andrew,tell me if it ends up at 360
Andrew,I don't think it's going to
Andrew,it doesn't matter that they're taken all at once
Andrew,it'd be the same thing if you picked one at a time
Andrew,I'm 95% sure it's just 6P4
Andrew,"(which actually is 360, either max is a god or he just plugged it in)"
Andrew,I did not use a calculator
Andrew,I did it in my head
Andrew,actually not true
Andrew,but I didn't use a P function
Andrew,I'm gonna assume you know the full formula for it tho?
Andrew,its 6x5x4x3
Andrew,easy
Andrew,suddenly realizes I've been using the overcomplicated version for if you have repeated elements
Andrew,goddamn it higher education for making me forget about simple solutions to stuff
Andrew,lol
Andrew,figured out why my ping was bad
Andrew,I have 2 exchange students staying at my house
Andrew,and they are both simultaneously using their phones and laptops
Andrew,gg
Andrew,rip
Andrew,dumb chinese people
Andrew,jk
Andrew,Does anyone here think its normal to call your friends by their last name?
Andrew,I think first name is more friendly so yeah last name is a little wierd
Andrew,why?
Andrew,someone is trying to convince me it is normal but nAH
Andrew,I want opinions of people who arent homeschool though
Andrew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gia6en2R0Q&feature=youtu.be I heard you guys like sick tracer highlights
Andrew,sick tracer highlight
Andrew,we still lost that push and the game :)
Andrew,we still lost that push though and the game 
Andrew,It is normal in some culture
Andrew,And I'm sure if ur name is something hard to say like Uvuvwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwembubwem Ossas then people would probably call you by urn last name
Andrew,Some of my friends call me by my last name occasionally
Andrew,@Feral Nebula it can be used kinda like a nickname
Andrew,Like you don't always call the by their last name
Andrew,But sometimes
Andrew,I think we need a wall between China and the us
Andrew,it very much depends on the person
Andrew,"it's rare, but some people prefer last name or middle name to first name"
Andrew,there was a guy at my elementary school who everyone called Mac and I didn't learn until grade 4 that that wasn't his actual name
Andrew,Our school have a guy we call max but that isn't his realy name
Andrew,also a lot of asian kids have a legal name and a given name and would much prefer if you used the given one
Andrew,"for example, I have a friend whose actual name is Xenswe, but we all just call him Ben"
Andrew,(might be a bit off on the spelling it's been awhile since I've actually seen it)
Andrew,It happens a lot in sports too. Probably because your last name is what's on all of your stuff
Andrew,also in sports some people's last names are just so clearly better than their first names
Andrew,like Stan Warinka
Andrew,@waowder csgo?
Andrew,Aren't you in school
Andrew,no
Andrew,we had a test today
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,play with us too
Andrew,I'm sorta in school though
Andrew,What is up my dudes
Andrew,Does anyone here find shoulders to be sexy or distracting
Andrew,no
Andrew,lol no
Andrew,literally no one does
Andrew,my high school was HILARIOUS(ly dumb) about it tho
Andrew,"Can't wear: Shirt that exposes your shoulders or stomach
Can wear: Shirt that exposes a solid 50% of your boobs"
Andrew,"I mean if you're gonna bring up the whole distraction thing, boobs are clearly way more distracting than shoulders"
Andrew,They tried to send me home
Andrew,"but even then, NO ONE IS ACTUALLY IGNORING CLASS TO STARE AT PEOPLE"
Andrew,Wait they tried to send you home because you were exposing your shoulders?
Andrew,wait they tried to send YOU home for exposing your shoulders?
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,your a dude
Andrew,WAIT WHAT
Andrew,why
Andrew,hahahaha
Andrew,Yup
Andrew,that's amazing
Andrew,thats so dumb
Andrew,your school is a trainwreck
Andrew,like are you just wearing a tank top?
Andrew,Apparently 2 teachers told the office person that I was wearing a tank top
Andrew,Like come on don't be a little bitch just dress code me yourself
Andrew,Sorry I am a little heated
Andrew,I mean I totally would be to
Andrew,dress code is dumb enough already
Andrew,the shoulders thing is even dumber
Andrew,but I've literally never heard of a GUY getting dresscoded for shoulders
Andrew,"""oh no his sculpted physique is distracting the class"""
Andrew,wait octagon showed his shoulders in school what a slut
Andrew,Ha
Andrew,I know I'm a whore
Andrew,But get this
Andrew,Girls are allowed to wear tank tops
Andrew,you should have told them it's within your rights to embrace your physical attractiveness
Andrew,WAIT WHAT
Andrew,Yup
Andrew,why is your school so dumb
Andrew,Do you understand my frustration now
Andrew,thats so wierd
Andrew,I mean I understood it before
Andrew,but it just keeps getting worse
Andrew,WHAT IS YOUR SCHOOL

Andrew,Who knows
Andrew,"in general, I would say either have no dress code whatsoever or do uniforms, don't half-ass it"
Andrew,"and yeah, uniforms kinda suck but there are arguments to be made for it, and most places would just not have a dress code"
Andrew,but god damn your school actually sounds like it has the worst implemented dress code I've ever heard of
Andrew,Yes it also is dependent on if the office people like you or not

Andrew,proud
Andrew,@Bitmin
Andrew,picking my degree tomorrow and super stressed about making the wrong choice
Andrew,@The Rona what degree are you going to go for?
Andrew,Some type of science
Andrew,I was thinking of doing science but given my current interests and skill set I think I might do business
Andrew,I basically get to design my courses for the first year or so before picking what I want
Andrew,cool
Andrew,You have to pick something that you're going to enjoy doing in the future
Andrew,So keep that in mind I guess
Andrew,That was the main reason I decided I probably shouldn't do a science job because I don't really enjoy doing math and I don't want that to be my job
Andrew,What type of business do you want?
Andrew,business management I think
Andrew,don't have to decide the specific type until year 3
Andrew,That's pretty cool
Andrew,but the general look of the course seems like something I would enjoy and be good at more than the engineering degrees I was looking at before
Andrew,Mine is the same
Andrew,It is the same in that the specific doesn't come until year 3?
Andrew,"Yeah, I have until year 3 to declare a major"
Andrew,But I can do it whenever
Andrew,Anniversary event

Andrew,and the other team isn't letting me play cause I have silver experience from two years ago
Andrew,"welp I just rang for a team, and I knew they sucked, but damn they just kicked their roamer cause he didn't know how to rocket jump"

Andrew,"$45 for three days of venue fee, twenty dollars for two events, tax"
Andrew,the venue fee at TGC the biggest tournament I ever went to was like $5
Andrew,"it's pretty rare to see more than 5-10, but I'm not surprised it's more for a major"
Andrew,"they have to cover the venue somehow, and I'm sure booking somewhere this big for a whole weekend isn't cheap"
Andrew,Done with finals and got a 100% on my last one

Andrew,@everyone Question 6 is up
Andrew,Who is the person who answered ambidextrous?
Andrew,"@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Any opinions before I officially change the cards?            Patch Notes For 1.4 
Necromancer- Cost reduced from 4>3. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 1 creature at night was removed. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 2 creatures was restricted to night time only. 
Poison Pump- Name changed to Catapult.
Soldier- HP decreased from 4>2
Barbarian- HP decreased from 2>1
Tribesman- Attack decreased from 2>1
Field Medic- Attack increased from 0>2
Break- Added effect “If this card is countered shuffle it into your deck instead of discarding it.”
Counterspell- You now lose 3 life if you play counterspell by sending a card to the void.
 Extract- The player who played extract now chooses which card gets discarded.
Banish- Added effect “You may not have more than 2 banishes in play at a time”.
Knight- HP increased from 3>4.
Spearman- HP increased from 3>4 Attack decreased from 2>1 Damage dealt by ability increased from 3>4.
Stasis Chamber- HP increased from 2>3
Sage- Cost increased from 1>2 Ability changed to “When Sage destroys a creature or damages a player you may add a spell or instant costing 2 or less to your hand”. Rather than playing the card for free and shuffling it back into your deck.
Zombie- HP increased from 1>2 Attack decreased from 3>2. Now only resurrects if you pay 1 resource.
Thundersurge- HP of creatures killed decreased from 3>1 cost decreased from 3>2.
Dig- HP gained by opponent decreased from 2>1.
Sword- Attack gained by equipped creature increased from 3>4."
Andrew,I was fond of old necromancer but I think that's why he's getting nerfed
Andrew,old necromancer was OP
Andrew,"I don't think soldier was all that good, maybe do 4->3 instead, cause otherwise he's almost too squishy (and you've not got that many cards with more than two hp)"
Andrew,18/27 of my creatures have more than 2 HP
Andrew,"one necromancer tweak I think would be interesting would be something like you have to sacrifice creatures such that the total health of your sacrificed stuff equals the number of resources you'd need to summon the thing you're bringing back, and maybe half that during the night, cause I liked that aspect of him"
Andrew,join voice if you can
Andrew,so basically you can drop a creature with only two health left to summon one that would require 2 resource to summon
Andrew,I can't
Andrew,there are two reasons I didn't do that
Andrew,also I don't think barb/tribesman were OP
Andrew,1 is there isn't enough room on the card to describe such an effect
Andrew,2 is that creatures with high attack on low HP would be to good with it
Andrew,how so?
Andrew,"you're not doing health -> health, you're doing health -> effective resources"
Andrew,oh in that case wall would make that super OP
Andrew,true
Andrew,didn't think of that
Andrew,I think the counterspell nerf is unecessary
Andrew,me neither
Andrew,also I haven't played with or against a bunch of the cards you're tweaking so I'll leave those up to you
Andrew,I'm considering how to make necromancer more interesting in the future but for now I just wanted him to not be OP so we can use him
Andrew,he is one of the more unique cards
Andrew,also I vote changing the name of poison pump to swarm
Andrew,ooh I like that
Andrew,thats good
Andrew,I'll use that
Andrew,cool-cool my work here is done
Andrew,I think I'm going to reduce the nerf to soldier and counterspell
Andrew,I like the extract change
Andrew,but doesn't it mean that you see the other person's hand? or you just pick randomly?
Andrew,New changes Soldier- HP reduced from 4>3 Counterspell- Lose 2 HP instead of 3 as I plannned before
Andrew,you see the other persons hand
Andrew,I feel like that makes it really good then
Andrew,not as good as before
Andrew,it used to be unquestionably the best card in the game
Andrew,and it controlled the meta
Andrew,then I nerfed it so hard that no one has really used it since
Andrew,I'm trying something new in the hopes that extract will become a good but not OP card
Andrew,getting ready for that extract banish combos tho
Andrew,oh I didn't think of that
Andrew,now I'm glad I nerfed banish a little
Andrew,rip my cool ideas
Andrew,having half of your deck be dead is an unwinnable position
Andrew,also your idea still works
Andrew,"yeah, if you can get both in your starting hand that is really good"
Andrew,Patch 1.5 might include new cards. If so you guys can recommend some ideas for them.
Andrew,time to start working on my storm cycle deck which I will of course be calling storm warning
Andrew,lol
Andrew,@Rotomotorz league
Andrew,dude... wall + sword = op?
Andrew,maybe
Andrew,wall fury was a deck in the original version of my game
Andrew,nice
Andrew,Also I forget a patch note
Andrew,Archives- Added effect “You may not use this ability on cards that can be recasted”
Andrew,MCG V1.4 is now live!
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane I made a storm warning deck
Andrew,but I was gonna do that tho
Andrew,you can also do one
Andrew,k
Andrew,I just wanted to see the different designes we could come up with
Andrew,"did you use like scout, dig, visions, wall and stuff"
Andrew,some but not all of those
Andrew,cool-cool
Andrew,My deck can be reduced to I think 4 cards
Andrew,all others banished
Andrew,although that may not be necessary
Andrew,nice dude
Andrew,we can test it later
Andrew,"as in like, a different day, I'm bouta go to sleep"
Andrew,Cool card idea: Watch 3 (Equipment)- Target creature exists in its own time which can be chosen and changed at any time by whoever controls the Watch.
Andrew,I like it

Andrew,"for my brother's uni graduation, he realized twenty minutes before leaving that he didn't own black socks, so he stole a pair of mine and then lost one in a lake"
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,rip sock

Andrew,yea +
Andrew,@waowder quickplay?
Andrew,TooLegend#11911
Andrew,can confirm - fewer things are worse than going through someone else's poorly commented css and trying to figure out what everything does
Andrew,saem
Andrew,css?
Andrew,"stands for cascading style sheet, it's basically what manages colours and fonts and a million other little things on webpages"
Andrew,"in general, html says what goes where, css says how it looks"
Andrew,and I'm digging through someone else's css and trying mostly by trial and error to figure out what affects what
Andrew,and it's brutal
Andrew,@Bitmin want to play overwatch in like 30 minutes?

Andrew,"also an unrelated question for all you americans, do ketchup chips actually not exist in the states?"
Andrew,i have no idea what a ketchup chip is
Andrew,nah i'm pretty sure ketchup chips are just a canada thing
Andrew,I don't even like ketchup chips but I cannot imagine them not existing
Andrew,like
Andrew,"literally any time anyone is getting chips for a party or something, you can't NOT bring ketchup chips cause someone there is going to love them"
Andrew,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Andrew,17 quadrillian degrees dude
Andrew,Is it a ketchup flavored chip?
Andrew,nah it's chip flavored ketchup
Andrew,yeah there's like a ketchup powder thing on it
Andrew,that feel when you remember bitmins name used to be bitshock
Andrew,WHAT
Andrew,I THOUGHT THOSE WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
Andrew,well it took the temperature going up to 34 for my family to turn on the AC but at this point I'm just glad it's on
Andrew,(also for you americans that's like 93 fahrenheit)
Andrew,It's supposed to get that hot in a few days where I am
Andrew,And I'm excited
Andrew,I love hot weather
Andrew,this is too hot for anything other than going to the beach
Andrew,ideal temperature is 15-22
Andrew,(basically 60-70)
Andrew,I prefer between 70-80
Andrew,that's probably the second best range
Andrew,"also -10 to 0 is pretty nice for winter stuff, cause there's still snow but it's not actually all that cold"
Andrew,We rarely get snow FeelsBadMan
Andrew,Though we did this year and schools were closed multiple days for like 3 inches
Andrew,lololol if canadian schools closed for three inches we'd be off from like mid december till mid march
Andrew,with a few weirdly warm days in the middle
Andrew,@Jed I'm at a lake so we can use our boat

Andrew,1. Driving in big cities sucks balls
Andrew,2. E3 is happening in LA this week
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane meme with me
Andrew,no
Andrew,pls
Andrew,no
Andrew,y
Andrew,how could you
Andrew,ur not a tur fren
Andrew,tru*
Andrew,not on computer
Andrew,So???
Andrew,I'm sulking
Andrew,meme on phone then
Andrew,too busy sulking
Andrew,lameo
Andrew,"He got dumped ok, let him sulk in peace"
Andrew,can't spell kameron without name
Andrew,cuz his name is trah lmao gg
Andrew,i cry
Andrew,and also sulk
Andrew,that too
Andrew,shulk?
Andrew,monando
Andrew,no
Andrew,nintendo's presentation kinda sucked btw
Andrew,did we get anything on xenoblade 2?
Andrew,ye
Andrew,some anime trailers
Andrew,no gameplay really
Andrew,E3 was pretty lacking this year
Andrew,agreed
Andrew,suddenly remembers that a) I don't have a switch and b) they're like $600 and c) I don't have $600 to spend on a switch
Andrew,nothing was really stand out in any of the presentations
Andrew,My friend just got one today
Andrew,He went to ebgames during lunch and they had 3 in stock
Andrew,naisu
Andrew,still not worth tho
Andrew,no games
Andrew,also he should sell it and profit
Andrew,And it was only ~$550 including Zelda
Andrew,kameron they have a 40 minute xenoblade gameplay video
Andrew,that is a lot of gameplay
Andrew,that's not the presentation bruh
Andrew,and goddamn it they kept the main character's hella dumb design
Andrew,ye
Andrew,the game is honestly pretty ugly
Andrew,man is wearing hollow harem pants with short shorts under them
Andrew,why
Andrew,also yeah it doesn't look great
Andrew,like ps2.5 graphics
Andrew,literally looks worse than x
Andrew,which has the terrifying uncanny valley people
Andrew,"looks almost as bad as the original, but they don't really compensate with cool looking stuff"
Andrew,"but the environments just aren't great in this one, and sure the stylization for the characters means they don't look bad graphically, but they just look awful aesthetically"
Andrew,ye
Andrew,also the fuck is that girls bust
Andrew,I'm 95% that's not how boobs work
Andrew,what are you some kinda doctah?
Andrew,remembers Fiora and Sharla and basically every female character other than Melia ok I guess that's always kinda been there
Andrew,doctor ur supposed to respond because I mentioned medical professionals
Andrew,starts watching the trailer THAT IS THE CHRONO TRIGGER OPENING YOU JUST STOLE
Andrew,after a brief double check it's the same composer so I guess it's fine
Andrew,also HYPE it's the same composer as chrono trigger
Andrew,I have not been super hyped for a game and then actually liked the game in such a long time
Andrew,last game may have been rivals of aether
Andrew,literally after looking at what they have to show the only thing I'm hyped for in xenoblade2 is the soundtrack
Andrew,also the boat is still broken rip
Andrew,seriously the world looks pretty awful and the character design is actually horrible
Andrew,"I swear to god the previous games have so many good character designs (if occasionally poor implementation cause meh graphics), and then SERIOUSLY WHAT IS THIS SHIT https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/e/ee/Switch_XenobladeChronicles2_E32017_character_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20170613180929"
Andrew,I left my computer ok man
Andrew,DO YOU REALLY NEED ALL THOSE BELTS
Andrew,no
Andrew,Those belts aren't even holding anything
Andrew,Except for the one around his waist
Andrew,"and the main female character is made of fanservice - super skinny, giant boobs, basically no clothing, and shorts so short they barely even qualify as shorts"
Andrew,thats just sad
Andrew,I mean there's always been a bit of fanservice in this series but that's taking it up a few too many levels
Andrew,they're basically at the level before kill la kill and THAT SHIT WAS A PARODY OF OVERDONE FANSERVICE
Andrew,I'm ok witht eh guy design but the pyra girl whatever is a little much
Andrew,"that also somehow managed to slip some actual good character designs in around the fanservice, which xenoblade 2 is very much not"
Andrew,"I was kinda hoping they'd do something about the characters after the first trailer came out way back when and everyone kinda went ""wow those characters look terrible"" but nope"
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Andrew,"on the plus side, unless they pull their shit together I no longer have a reason to drop $600 on a switch"
Andrew,Splatoon 2?
Andrew,Mario Odyssey?
Andrew,Kirby Switch?
Andrew,FE Switch?
Andrew,can we talk about mario oddesssy for a second
Andrew,Arms?
Andrew,arms is bad
Andrew,Metroid 4?
Andrew,the free trial was 0 fun
Andrew,and how fucking bizzare a cartoonish character looks in a moderately (or at least anatomically accurate) world?
Andrew,But it doesnt even look that bad
Andrew,I'm not sold on it
Andrew,it's a pretty clashing visual style
Andrew,"both can work well on their own, but together it's just weird"
Andrew,it'd be like anime characters showing up in american cartoons
Andrew,also why does nintendo keep making dynasty warriors style games
Andrew,"sure hyrule warriors was kind of a cult classic but I feel like a lot of that was people following the LoZ train, and they're kinda boned doing it with series with smaller fanbases"
Andrew,Fire Emblem has a respectable fanbase
Andrew,"Fire Emblem, sure, but why are they making a Fate/ one? no one actually likes anything other than the animes and the vn"
Andrew,they'll lose it if they only have awakening fates and marth so
Andrew,"lol ""respectable fanbase"""
Andrew,maybe if they added some of the other games
Andrew,it'll probably still sell fine with just awakefates + marth
Andrew,I mean they got a decently spread cast for heroes (sure it's pretty skewed but at least they got SOME from other games)
Andrew,Lmao these Splat Tim memes are so good
Andrew,huh?
Andrew,In the splatoon tournament at E3
Andrew,Tim is a us memeber who got like a 3v1 doubel
Andrew,and now the chat memes whenever he does something
Andrew,he's not even the best player on the US team but he's a good meme
Andrew,(I know nothing about splatoon but that seems cool)
Andrew,oh boy the US won
Andrew,does this mean the US is finally good at an esport lmao
Andrew,@Rotomotorz league
Andrew,Actually
Andrew,looking at Pyra she's not much worse than fiora
Andrew,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Andrew,no
Andrew,kys
Andrew,will do budy
Andrew,am not your buddy pal
Andrew,am not your pal buddy
Andrew,your not my friend unfriended on bnet get fucked lil bitch
Andrew,oh......
Andrew,com'on man that was too far...
Andrew,good god the final mission of xenoblade x is hard
Andrew,I mean I might be like 5 levels lower than the boss I'm trying to fight but still
Andrew,I keep knocking off most of his health and getting so damn close and then he kills me
Andrew,"fuck you, fat man in a large mech"
Andrew,"FUCK IT I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW A FEW LEVELS HIGHER AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHOSE BIRTHRIGHT IS PAIN, ASSHOLE"
Andrew,lol someone is a little upset
Andrew,bastard has so much health
Andrew,and he keeps spawning stuff that has lots of health
Andrew,and then he goes invincible AND REGENS HIS HEALTH
Andrew,AND THEN SPAWNS MORE THINGS
Andrew,wow that sounds terrible to play against
Andrew,I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S THE FINAL BOSS I'M ONLY ON PART 3/5 OF THE MISSION
Andrew,also it's actually a pretty fun fight
Andrew,but I'm really feeling the AI handicap
Andrew,I feel like if somehow I could have three additional humans handling my party members I could win this fight
Andrew,Is that possible?
Andrew,nope
Andrew,but hey at least the ai's not as bad as in the original
Andrew,and at least the music's hella badass
Andrew,@Rotomotorz league?
Andrew,sure hold up i'm patching

Andrew,also there was a twist where I had almost the right idea and I'm so mad
Andrew,I almost predicted it
Andrew,my logic was so almost but not quite correct
Andrew,was it a good game?
Andrew,yee
Andrew,"definately have some issues with the game, but overall good"
Andrew,(also I'm hella nitpicky so most of the issues are pretty minor)
Andrew,Going to attend the MCG conference tomorrow?
Andrew,probably yeah
Andrew,can't wait to be back
Andrew,also I swear they saved like all the best songs for the last little bit
Andrew,pre-final boss - awesome music
Andrew,final boss - awesome music
Andrew,"cutscene in between the two of those, hella pretty"
Andrew,credits theme - damn good
Andrew,"most of the rest of the game - occasional scattered good songs here and there but the ones you hear a lot (normal battle theme, hub area, etc) kinda crappy"
Andrew,aw really you're gonna end it on another twist and leave some stuff totally unexplained
Andrew,dammit
Andrew,you'd better make a fucking sequel

Andrew,and they also haven't emailed me back about a whole bunch of stuff for like two weeks -_-
Andrew,rip thats pretty unprofessional of them

A blooperberry

Andrew,A rasp-berry
Andrew,oh my god
Andrew,I am the pun king

Andrew,@Max @Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak
Andrew,wow that's awful
Andrew,I mean no one used it anyway
Andrew,but why encourage people to not use it even more
Andrew,That's what I'm saying
Andrew,I like how it is now
Andrew,"It's supposed to be a fun gimmick, not a viable weapon"
Andrew,@here ovahwatch???
Andrew,@Bitmin @Zain
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane level up that alt man
Andrew,mmmmk
Andrew,Rip computer
Andrew,IM DECAYING :[
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane @Zain 6 wins and 2 losses so far in my placements.
Andrew,I think my mother board is dead
Andrew,wow that sucks
Andrew,didn't you just get a new computer
Andrew,Well it isn't new
Andrew,The motherboard was still stock
Andrew,And had been used somewhat
Andrew,@Bitmin 5 mins
Andrew,oh shit I though the life is strange sale was $5 per chapter but it's $5 for the whole thing
Andrew,I MUST GET IT
Andrew,that is cheap
Andrew,"Did you paly the demo, Quick?"
Andrew,no
Andrew,I still haven't finished the demo but I'm liking what I've seen so far (and yes I know that wasn't directed at me)
Andrew,but 5 dollars for the whole thing is worth it
Andrew,"it's on sale till the 5th, give the demo a shot first"
Andrew,"Also by demo, it's actually the full first episode"
Andrew,Also I got a Switch today!
Andrew,
Andrew,cool-cool
Andrew,nice nice
Andrew,SYLKI HOW DARE YOU STEAL MY SAYING AFFIRMATIVE WORDS TWICE THING
Andrew,thats my thing
Andrew,I SAY NICE NICE ALL THE TIME
Andrew,THATS A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Andrew,YOU'RE A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Andrew,THATS NOT VERY NICE NICE TO SAY
Andrew,also code geass is really good
Andrew,yeeee
Andrew,how far are you?
Andrew,curently on episode 15
Andrew,and the code geass binge continues
Andrew,it's impossible to not binge your first time through
Andrew,feelsbadman?
Andrew,I watched the whole thing in four days
Andrew,both seasons?
Andrew,and the first 46 episodes in 3
Andrew,yeah the whole thing
Andrew,wait how many seasons are there?
Andrew,just two right?
Andrew,just the two
Andrew,c2 is confusing
Andrew,they're doing a third but there's a decent chance it's just a cash grab cause apparently the studio's not doing so well and it does seem odd that they'd suddenly rejuvinate the series like 9 years later
Andrew,WOW CHIKON YOURE SUCH A WEEABOO
Andrew,yur bad at overwatch
Andrew,ok
Andrew,at least I'm not a filthy weeb
Andrew,OH WAIT XDDDD
Andrew,yeah I was gonna say
Andrew,you have an animoo profile picture
Andrew,shhh
Andrew,we dont talk about that
Andrew,at least you're not like the closet weeb from kingston
Andrew,"apparently, changing his tag to Kaneki ""wasn't a weeb thing or anything"""
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,"but at the moment his profile picture is Rem from re zero and that whole ""not a weeb thing"" is looking even less plausible than before"
Andrew,he just needs to accept it
Andrew,being a weeb is fun
Andrew,hear hear
Andrew,"(don't kill me kameron, hear hear is a thing that needs to go twice)"
Andrew,lol
Andrew,YOU SHALL BE PUBLICALLY EXECUTED SYLKI FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST MY IDIOSYNCRASIES
Andrew,OBJECTION!
Andrew,you can't make me
Andrew,"also, @Mr. Airplane @The Rona @Rotomotorz you guys want to try starting the race over tonight?"
Andrew,Maybe
Andrew,If I'm not caught up playing Zelda :L
Andrew,Maybe as well

Andrew,Can you review a vod for me later
Andrew,Im uploading it to youtube and could really use some feedback on this particular loss 
Andrew,sure
Andrew,@Zain
Andrew,"Thank you im uploading it now. I played mostly mcree, but threw in some stall heroes at the end"
Andrew,
Andrew,@everyone
Andrew,so close to my season high
Andrew,Oh wait this belongs in the memes channel
Andrew,@everyone i lent trap my adblocker account and he won feelzgoodman
Andrew,Feels good man
Andrew,"don't know if anyone here still plays fe heroes but the voting thing is crazy close - they're apart by ~1.2 million points, which seems like a lot execpt that the scores are both almost thirty BILLION"
Andrew,aka they differ by 0.012%
Andrew,voting on what?
Andrew,it's basically waifu wars
Andrew,"(this time at least, normally it's not JUST girls)"
Andrew,who are the two characters being voted on?
Andrew,this time around it was basically who's the best healer character and it's ended up narrowed down to elise and priscilla
Andrew,and given that I never used priscilla in fe7 I'm backing elise
Andrew,we're down 1.2 million
Andrew,So your supposed to vote on character strength?
Andrew,naw just how much you like the character
Andrew,So even if one is clearly better you could still vote for the other just because you like them better?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,also all the healers kinda suck in this game
Andrew,so you're not really voting for whoever's the strongest
Andrew,and while you do get slightly better prizes if you win it's not really that significant
Andrew,i am confirmed masters player

Andrew,I wanted him out
Andrew,why?
Andrew,because his political opinions didnt align with his
Andrew,Too many reasons to explain in text but to put it simply I am a Republican and he is not so why wouldn't I want him out.
Andrew,I mean being a Republican doesn't mean you have to dislike a Democratic nominee.
Andrew,A nominee which I disagree with on 90%+ of issues is not going to have my support.
Andrew,^^^
Andrew,truth
Andrew,Well what did you not agree with him on?
Andrew,nearly everything
Andrew,Remember the part where he said there was too much to explain over text

Andrew,time to spam andrew with voicemails
Andrew,lol
Andrew,do it
Andrew,you won't
Andrew,lol
Andrew,already did it
Andrew,I just had the dumbest shift of my life
Andrew,shift was 300-530
Andrew,"I get paid by the delivery, and no one orders food during that time period"
Andrew,normally I'd get two or three deliveries for that
Andrew,"I got one delivery, and I had to wait till 445"
Andrew,wow that sucks
Andrew,delivery fee - $7
Andrew,tip - $21
Andrew,I'll take it
Andrew,"so basically I sat around for two hours, worked for twenty minutes, made almost $30"
Andrew,sounds like a weird job
Andrew,like not profitable very much
Andrew,or am I wrong?
Andrew,yeah it's super not profitable
Andrew,"it pays well per hour, especially if you can get a dinner shift (530-830 is suuuuch a good shift to get), but there aren't many shifts"
Andrew,seriously the 530-830 pays about $20 an hour

Andrew,IDK
Andrew,Why does hyp keep getting kicked
Andrew,He doesn't do anything wrong
Andrew,because no one likes him
Andrew,???
Andrew,Mrd do you like hype
Andrew,"To me, it seems like he doesn't care about us. Maybe? Dunno."
Andrew,No he likes being in here. He really wants to be involved
Andrew,that's too bad
Andrew,Who keeps kicking him?
Andrew,he is banned
Andrew,Really?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,fusion was the one who kicked him the first time and trap invited him back
Andrew,I honestly have no clue.
Andrew,Why is he banned
Andrew,What did he do
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,I did have one experience where he just joins a channel other people are in and just leaves.
Andrew,I do that
Andrew,Maybe invite him back and ask him
Andrew,"And if he gives a valid reason, ban him again, unless you hate him"
Andrew,
Andrew,Okay okay point taken!
Andrew,it was agreed upon by many people to ban him
Andrew,so it stands
Andrew,I didn't hear about that so I didn't know.
Andrew,Nah
Andrew,That's not valid there wasn't a vote
Andrew,When fusion gets back we're taking a vote
Andrew,no
Andrew,max is admin
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,For now
Andrew,Then ask him
Andrew,I will talk to Fusion about this when he gets back for now I will drop it
Andrew,4 of the master memers agreed
Andrew,fusion kicked him in the first place
Andrew,4 out of 8
Andrew,That's not even a majority
Andrew,"(for the record I just kinda shrugged my shoulders and didn't vote, but I'm not against it, I can see why he rubs a lot of people the wrong way)"
Andrew,and the others don't even know him
Andrew,That doesn't include the other members
Andrew,"also let's be fair, smithy and bitmin are hardly around, fusion's gone and left max in charge"
Andrew,"All I'm saying is when fusion gets back, I'm going to ask to have this reconsidered"
Andrew,"He's my friend, and I really like having him around"
Andrew,That is all
Andrew,/End
Andrew,woah
Andrew,private calls are a thing
Andrew,who knew
Andrew,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Andrew,/End
Andrew,"Who knew, weaponized autism is a thing that infects over 69 million 8 sided shapes a year"
Andrew,༼ つ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ  that's where you're wrong kiddo
Andrew,aight if this keeps devolving into throwing shit at each other I'm gonna have to request that you just do it in pms
Andrew,when you lose control of a situation it automatically shoots to insults huh
Andrew,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Andrew,I'm done
Andrew,also I realize I could have done a sick pun with pms and PMs but I wasted the opportunity
Andrew,dang
Andrew,"""If you guys are gonna go all PMS on each other I'd appreciate if you did it through PMs"""
Andrew,boom
Andrew,what a missed opportunity
Andrew,rip
Andrew,I'm not the one who started with a bad attitude about this. Also okay @Sak von Sak I'll move this so I don't end up bannerinod

Andrew,@Trapezoider
Andrew,newt films?
Andrew,one of the things I love about one of the webcomics I'm reading is that everyone who reads it has been conditioned to it being depressing so that any time something nice happens we all get really scared
Andrew,even though nothing particularly bad has happened for like five chapters (of seven)
Andrew,but you can't just kill off half the cast two chapters in and not expect people to be constantly nervous
Andrew,@Jed thank you yes
Andrew,yeah boi

Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,The feeling when you skip your families arbitrary religious weekly ceremony of church so your parents unplug the router and lock the door leaving you home alone without internet
Andrew,But then you discover you have an lte hotspot your pc can connect to
Andrew,Feelsgoodman
Andrew,Can't you just plug the router back in?
Andrew,The door to the router is locked
Andrew,I don't know where the key is
Andrew,:(
Andrew,Use a Bobby pin
Andrew,How tho
Andrew,Is it ez
Andrew,??
Andrew,It's just one of those little hole locks right?
Andrew,Ye I think so
Andrew,Lemme check
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,I used to do that all the time as a kid
Andrew,if you have enough data to get on discord you have enough data to look up how to pick locks
Andrew,^
Andrew,Okay
Andrew,Let me discover a Bobby pins
Andrew,Pin*
Andrew,although you may end up convincing your parents that you're basically just slowly backing into the depths of hell and you'll be in even more trouble
Andrew,just a warning
Andrew,Yeah if you plug it back in they'll be angry
Andrew,Risk/reward
Andrew,My parents think I'm going to hell because I subscribe to evolution as the most practical model of biological origins
Andrew,So that's a good point
Andrew,I mean aside from the hell thing you'll still probably get in more trouble
Andrew,They half jokingly talk about it like that. Not sure if they mean it
Andrew,Feelsvadman
Andrew,Pc thrown in trashcan 
Andrew,Lol
Andrew,I would kms
Andrew,And sabotage my dad
Andrew,oh yeah that was just fantastic when it happened
Andrew,I just used it as a metaphor/emphasis thingy/whatever you would call it dammit it's been too long since I took english as a class
Andrew,Wait
Andrew,Jed will tweezers work?
Andrew,I can't find Bobby pins
Andrew,Probably not
Andrew,if you're talking about a regular locked door a screw driver works
Andrew,That too
Andrew,at least my type of doors
Andrew,A tiny one?
Andrew,I have a tiny one
Andrew,try it

Andrew,"Dang shroud makes almost 250,000 a year just off twitch subs"
Andrew,Assuming they are all the cheapest sub option

Andrew,@here
Andrew,anyone good with wordpress??
Andrew,I am possibly down for things
Andrew,sure
Andrew,http://newtfilms.com
Andrew,Newt Films
Andrew,The Future of Filmmaking
Andrew,@here
Andrew,what do you guys think so far
Andrew,NOt done
Andrew,Just general theme n stuff
Andrew,"it looks nice but one small thing, why is youtube green?"
Andrew,All the bright colors make me feel like its and ad
Andrew,maybe that's just me
Andrew,they're not that bright
Andrew,You got a reason why blue green yellow purple are your main colors
Andrew,im gonna try and figure out how to change the stuff to red black and white
Andrew,Thats our colors
Andrew,I agree that youtube should be red for recognizeability
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,Cant figure out how to do it with the assets Im using
Andrew,said bois
Andrew,Oh in that case it's fine then
Andrew,also a newt film logo or something instead of the cavern maybe?
Andrew,thats why I asked if anyone is good with wordpress
Andrew,or something film related at least
Andrew,ALso thank you for feedback
Andrew,okay our logo actually looks like ass
Andrew,No if those are you colors then it makes more sense to stick to those instead
Andrew,whats wrong with your logo?
Andrew,I thought it was fine other than the art maybe having a few minor mistakes
Andrew,
Andrew,that just looks so ugly to me
Andrew,Bleh
Andrew,Put the newt on top of films
Andrew,
Andrew,This one looks good
Andrew,On business cards
Andrew,Just elegant
Andrew,Simple
Andrew,Not so IN YOUR FACE BYATCH
Andrew,Eh
Andrew,"I think if you put the newt on tip of films, starting from the right edge of the F and then extending to the end of the S, it'll look fine"
Andrew,lol that logo took our guy like 6 months because hes a lazy piece of shit. I hardly want to ask him to do another thing. Gotta find another guy tbh
Andrew,does anyone have the old frostbite logos. Also thank you @Rotomotorz
Andrew,"However also make the height of the word newt taller than the gap between the top of the F and the top of the I, so it doesn't look like Fnewt films lol"
Andrew,lmao gonna steal them 
Andrew,no just curious
Andrew,Lol frostbite
Andrew,I built a new pc
Andrew,So I lost them
Andrew,be there soon octagon

Andrew,"Eighth-grader Shigeo ""Mob"" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks. In order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Reigen Arataka, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Andrew,doc = too tired
Andrew,gg
Andrew,I'm super tired man
Andrew,doc is a dork
Andrew,.org
Andrew,where did that joke originate?
Andrew,Umm guys
Andrew,Umm trap
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether Someone play against my ori
Andrew,@ me anytime to play
Andrew,oh shit that's out?
Andrew,goddammit I'm still stuck with my terrible internet
Andrew,When do you think you'll be back?
Andrew,shrugs
Andrew,he's not getting better as fast as he was supposed to (largely because he's super stubborn and not doing all the stuff he's supposed to to help him get better) so I can't even really follow the doctor's estimate cause that was supposed to be sunday
Andrew,is he fun tho?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,However I'm still in the SDing when going offstage due to not knowing when I can jump out of my arials phase.
Andrew,lol
Andrew,His recovery is definitely the best in the game if you are high and definitely the worst if you are low
Andrew,well actually wrastor is probably better high
Andrew,All around air is just as good as I thought it would be
Andrew,he seems pretty nuts from what little I've seen
Andrew,and I feel like he's gonna be one of the those characters with a steep learning curve
Andrew,aka I'll probably suck at him
Andrew,From what I can tell his weakness is having 0 kill setups
Andrew,still gonna give him a shot once I'm back home
Andrew,I think I'm going to try and get good at him
Andrew,wait that seems kind of crippling
Andrew,or does he just have enough stuff that can kill that it doesn't really matter?
Andrew,His smash attack hitboxes are REALLY BIG
Andrew,like BIG
Andrew,its insane
Andrew,like etalus big?
Andrew,bigger
Andrew,the fuck
Andrew,etalus fsmash actually covers 1/4 - 1/3 of the stage (depending on the stage)
Andrew,That is because he moves
Andrew,not because the hitbox is big
Andrew,it covers less space than etalus fsmash but the hitboxes on upsmash and downsmash are huge
Andrew,so basically big band? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/276801025258684416/288837755247525889/bb-cmk.png
Andrew,but with a small hurtbox
Andrew,not that big
Andrew,at some point we eventually need to play more SG
Andrew,(I say while trying to learn blazblue)
Andrew,Ori will be good at edgeguarding etalus
Andrew,he has a move that is almost exactly like wrastors down smash
Andrew,return of the downsmash vs tech wars of early 2017
Andrew,@Sak von Sak I think Ori is going to be one of my favorite characters
Andrew,@Jed ROA?
Andrew,in a bit]
Andrew,@ me when ready
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,@Max what are the best melee ai?
Andrew,Link and captain falcon in vanilla
Andrew,umm
Andrew,But probably fox on the latest 20xx since he has actual tech skill
Andrew,that's not what max said he said gannon was best
Andrew,i don't remember the other one though
Andrew,Max has done several ai tournaments and pretty sure link has won them all almost
Andrew,Luigi
Andrew,Wait.falcon may have been bad
Andrew,Yeah Luigi and link I think

Andrew,welcome to oregon
Andrew,in the winter
Andrew,there was a break yesterday for a few hours
Andrew,and its only been three days
Andrew,too bad its rain and not snow xd @ oregon
Andrew,we actually had snow last year
Andrew,but also rain
Andrew,mostly just rain
Andrew,I've seen it snow enough in a single night that it practically shut down the city for about a week
Andrew,yay canada
Andrew,woah
Andrew,same
Andrew,"except it was like 4"""
Andrew,still basically shut down the city 
Andrew,Yeah seriously
Andrew,Oregon drivers are pussies
Andrew,yeah thats pathetic
Andrew,Gets single snow flake
Andrew,to be fair
Andrew,west salem is hills
Andrew,"""SHUTDOWN WHOLE DAMN ROAD"""
Andrew,and it was ice under snow
Andrew,Ava Texans are no better with snow xD
Andrew,also we have like what 1 snow plow?
Andrew,"well there is no snow to speak of, ever"
Andrew,"it was some weird freak of temperature and stuff where it snowed a ton, rained a bit, then the rain froze, the whole city was under like a foot of ice, massive power outages across the city, technically drivable but horrifyingly unsafe roads (which we used anyway to make it somewhere with power)"
Andrew,at least in southern texas
Andrew,one of my friends who lives three blocks from me had no power for three weeks
Andrew,aaaAAAA
Andrew,no power makes me wanna die
Andrew,"no internet, no a conditioner/heater, to way to make food"
Andrew,try no power and temperature below freezing
Andrew,how did you live
Andrew,we ran away to somewhere with power
Andrew,"if you couldn't do that, layers and layers of clothing and blankets, use of fireplaces, sharing body heat, etc."
Andrew,sounds terrible
Andrew,sometimes im salty I never get snow but then I hear about how bad snowy places have it
Andrew,"""sharing body heat"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Andrew,"that's by far the worst I've seen, usually it isn't so bad"
Andrew,but honestly snow's not all it's cracked up to be
Andrew,it's nice for the first month or so
Andrew,then it's kinda annoying
Andrew,my childhood dreams are crushed
Andrew,and come february/march you just want nothing to do it anymore
Andrew,
Andrew,yeah its novelty wears off fast
Andrew,"skiing and skating and sledding and snowball fights are still fun, but you kinda stop doing any of that after the first bit"
Andrew,I love ice skating but the nearest rink is like an hour away
Andrew,rip
Andrew,nowhere I've stayed in canada has had a rink more than like a fifteen minute walk away
Andrew,time to move
Andrew,15 minute WALK?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,How many ice rinks must there be to have one so close to everyone
Andrew,shrugs welcome to canada
Andrew,also generally I've only stayed in family-focused residential areas so those tend to have rinks nearby
Andrew,"To be sure of hitting the target, shoot first and call whatever you hit the target."
Andrew,some quote ^
Andrew,That sounds so awesome
Andrew,I'm really into skating sports
Andrew,I'm kinda good for a novice
Andrew,Lodda fun
Andrew,I'm pretty awful at em but they're a good time
Andrew,@everyone let's do the Meetup in Canada
Andrew,no
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,"I can't go to Canada, no way my parents would let me"
Andrew,too far
Andrew,good we don't want you
Andrew,jk
Andrew,depresso
Andrew,that means max wouldnt go either
Andrew,nah max is an adult
Andrew,he's 17
Andrew,and living at home
Andrew,but will be 18 by the time we go anywhere
Andrew,yeah but I'm sure our parents will still stop him
Andrew,I'm just sad we don't have enough west coasters to justify going somewhere where there's in&out
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,I mean if you guys want to come out I wouldn't be opposed
Andrew,eh transport'll be way more
Andrew,and this way I don't have an excuse
Andrew,they have them in texas
Andrew,thats the furthest east I think
Andrew,This is getting insane
Andrew,I saw someone riding a jet ski on a road I sometimes drive on...
Andrew,oh god that's amazing
Andrew,Not if you live here and may have to evacuate.
Andrew,We might be running out of roads to leave on.
Andrew,true
Andrew,So are you gonna leave soon
Andrew,are things still good where you are?
Andrew,We just learned that leaving is impossible at this point. So it looks like we are going to have to camp on our second story if things get bad.
Andrew,For the moment though things are still okay.
Andrew,but you mostly live up there anyway so...
Andrew,True but we will have to cut the power to the house.
Andrew,Well shoot
Andrew,Stay safe man
Andrew,that sucks
Andrew,yeah stay safe and keep us posted
Andrew,I'll update you guys if things get worse
Andrew,Thanks for the support
Andrew,np
Andrew,Yo if you have to cut power you won't have discord right?
Andrew,don't die
Andrew,I have a phone now
Andrew,do you have data tho?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,That's my number
Andrew,(oh right it's the states data's way cheaper)
Andrew,"@Max  question, if you do have to camp on the second floor, would it be possible just to cut power to the first floor?"
Andrew,I'm not sure
Andrew,woah what an idea
Andrew,that could save my sanity
Andrew,i ask cause one of my friends is in the same situation you might be in and they only cut breakers to the first floor
Andrew,Ava it's literally flooding and you worry about wifi
Andrew,it isnt about wifi

Donald J Trump sits straight up in his interview chair. In his pitifully tiny hands, he hold a smartphone. He is using the front facing camera to check himself out, and preen himself up as he prepares to be on camera
TRUMP (TO SELF)
You're a winner Donald, a winner I tell yah
Donald winks to himself and clicks off the phone, and puts it into his pocket
DIRECTOR
President Trump, are we ready to roll yet sir?
TRUMP

You bet it James! 
Trump says as he winks

Are the incredible men and women on this set ready to capture my fantastic appearance today?

Yes President Trump. We have been preparing for this shoot for a few weeks. Were all very eager to get this over with.

Fantastic!
James walks out of frame and trump sits up extra straight in his seat.

Action!
A slate man appears in front of the main camera and clicks the slate board.
James nods to trump
TRUMP
I will never forget, the day I won the election in 2016. It was amazing, truly fantastic. Really shows that america is a nation of faith, a nation of faith in me. Donald J trump. 
Trump looks down and takes a deep breath through the mouth
TRUMP
Sadly folks, crooked Hillary is trying to bring me down this election cycle. Shes trying to say I worked with Putin, really great guy by the way, to win last years election. That's why I need your help. I need you, and the rest of America to come together, and make this election great. So that I can win, and keep crooked politicians like Hillary and Berney out of office! They would make a huge...
Trump suddenly gets distracted and pulls his phone out of his pocket.
TRUMP
Hehe, Megan Kelly responded to my apology tweet
TRUMP
In Megan Kelly Voice Impersonation Mr Trump I find your lewd comments, rude and offensive
Rolls eyes at camera
TRUMP
I demand you make a more formal and respectful apology, I am uphalled!

Andrew,"JAMES
whispering Donald, we need to get this back on track!
TRUMP
Oh, right
Trump puts the phone back into his pocket
TRUMP
And that is why I need your help to keep berney and Hillary out of office by voting me in instead. I promise, if you vote for me, I will literally buy all of your children I phone 8's. I have HUGE amounts of money because of how successful and fortunate I am! I swear if I wasn't for TRUMP brand I couldn't count a dime to my name, but I swear to God, you put my name and some god damned gold on a building, and you will be rich out of your mind
James can be seen making huge x motions with his hands
TRUMP
James why are you doing that with your hands
James walks into frame, and on set. 
JAMES
Donald, we talked about this extensively before hand. This is network television, you cant swear and say whatever the hell you want! I need you to tone it back, or were going to have to cancel this broadcast.
TRUMP
...
TRUMP
You know what James. I'm going to make you an offer.
James sighs and shakes his head in regret

Whispers to self Oh lord what this time...

You know what Donald, you do whatever the hell you want. You have infinite money, if you fuck up this broadcast, and get me in trouble with the network, I will let you handle it.

Andrew,The carbine?
Andrew,I think so
Andrew,Yeah that thing was busted
Andrew,yeah its was
Andrew,I only use the pistol in machine gun for the first half of the game
Andrew,Then shit got way too hard so I started using real guns
Andrew,yeah the difficulty ramps way up in the last third or so
Andrew,Now my go play Bioshock and BioShock 2 right
Andrew,I should probably play those too
Andrew,I bought the package all three remastered for 20 bucks
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,also imo the most fun gun combo is hand cannon + that rebel shotgun that lights people on fire
Andrew,That thing didn't have any ammo though
Andrew,yeah they're both pretty low on ammo
Andrew,I wish I'd had more money on my plate through cause then I could have got more cool upgrades
Andrew,I didn't say it was practical
Andrew,I think we can all agree the repeater was booty though
Andrew,which one's that?
Andrew,It was like the machine gun but with the less ammo in the slower rate of fire. It was a vox gun
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,and takes fire up to be accurate
Andrew,dude the insane asylum part was spooky
Andrew,when ben franklins head rolled out i paused and walked away

The demo is available to download through battle.net. It doesn't matter if you are new to the game because if we manage to get a big enough game the large number of players will balance out the more skilled players as they can be teamed against. I think this could be really fun so I hope enough of you are willing to give it a try for us to play! Confirmed players so far: Me, Sylki."

Andrew,tuesday is hell tho

Andrew,Ouch
Andrew,yikes
Andrew,6.5 hours of class spread haphazardly across 12 hours of time
Andrew,HaA
Andrew,Sucks for you mAtE

Andrew,"two 1.5-hour segments of the same class, an hour and a half apart, in different lecture halls"
Andrew,"on the flip side, for winter term (january-april) I have 7 fewer hours of class per week"
Andrew,and no classes friday
Andrew,seriously winter term is a joke for me https://gyazo.com/f2346dd6cd66473f5a2477a1cbe7f2a1
Andrew,Gyazo
Andrew,"12 hours a week, no friday classes, one online course"
Andrew,Why would you get your classes so far apart?
Andrew,Mine are 10 minutes apart
Andrew,although for one of those I'll have to cross the campus in those 10 minutes oops
Andrew,"cause these are all the only timeslots for these classes, or I used these specific ones in order to not have friday classes"
Andrew,"also I like having spaced out classes, gives you time to relax and do nice things like eat or chill at the library in between"
Andrew,I'd much rather have three hours of class with 3 hour gaps than three hours of straight classes with ten minute breaks and the rest of the day off
Andrew,and honestly I'd put up with a lot for perpetual 3-day weekends
Andrew,"which will probably translate to me doing a lot more out of town smash tournaments, especially if I can find people to carpool with -_-"
Andrew,@Max how was your first day of college?
Andrew,It was fine
Andrew,Had to park super far away from my class
Andrew,How were the classes tho
Andrew,First day was just learning about the course
Andrew,no real work
Andrew,"oh yeah you've never had syllabus days before, have you?"
Andrew,expect that for the whole first week
Andrew,That's how it usually is
Andrew,Whole first week?
Andrew,"One of the first things my EDUC prof said to us is ""I like to cuss a lot so if that offends you please switch classes""."
Andrew,yeah profs are also an interesting mixed bag
Andrew,EDUC?
Andrew,It is a required course where you learn about college and how to succeed in life
Andrew,"also yeah for uni it's usually the first week, cause you've got your courses spread out by day (you start doing stuff in some courses but it's mostly review of previous material)"
Andrew,seems like an easy A
Andrew,that sounds either really useful or incredibly boring

Andrew,@Sak von Sak stop playing psp and play rivals with me
Andrew,"I'm not really in the mood (kinda platform fightered out, playing badly today and I'm frustrated)"
Andrew,lets play a different game then
Andrew,i need someone to hang out with
Andrew,"housemates are already going to sleep, can't talk either way"
Andrew,  
Andrew,
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane are you an uber driver now
Andrew,no
Andrew,oh lol
Andrew,^
Andrew,my stats prof opened our first class by just kind of playing jazz over the speakers for the first five minutes
Andrew,but why
Andrew,cause he's a super chill old guy
Andrew,haha early classes
Andrew,I already had an 830
Andrew,and I have classes today until 8pm
Andrew,tuesdays are hell
Andrew,My mondays suck
Andrew,But your tuesday seems worse than my monday
Andrew,All my days are the same
Andrew,I have class from 8:30-6:50
Andrew,I've only got 6.5 hours total but they're spread out and I'm basically stuck on campus all day
Andrew,That's the same with me
Andrew,all my classes are like an hour apart
Andrew,"I've got some half hour breaks, some hour and a half, some two hours, but never at convienient times to go back home until the end of the day"
Andrew,You need that briefcase setup
Andrew,"He just put up a slide that just says ""How not to fail STAT263 and any non-fakeable course"""
Andrew,shots fired
Andrew,"he just showed us his first year transcript, his highest mark is a 67 and he failed some"
Andrew,what a baller
Andrew,"and now he's literally going ""english.  I could fake that.  Calculus, not so much"""
Andrew,his average was a 48
Andrew,How did this mans become a professor?
Andrew,he's telling the story of how he turned his life around
Andrew,"and he actually just said ""I'm probably the only person teaching right now who had a year like this"""
Andrew,"he says he's willing to print out a certificate that says ""For what it's worth, this is to certify that [YOUR NAME HERE] is, in fact, smarter than Professor Charles Arthur Molson"""
Andrew,man gives no fucks
Andrew,"""What I hope to hear said about me is 'Damn, that dumb son of a bitch can really teach'"""
Andrew,and he's now pulling bad reviews from his own ratemyteacher page
Andrew,"""if you're sleeping in my class, that's fine"""
Andrew,now he's using a picture of grafitti from a queen's bathroom stall to demonstrate statistics
Andrew,what a god
Andrew,he's planning to use the distribution of cell phones ringing during his lectures as something we're going to study
Andrew,"""When the grim reaper comes for you, you will never get these stat263 hours back"""
Andrew,"""Ha! And you were wondering what scary thing to dress up as for halloween? LURKING VARIABLES"""
Andrew,I figured three hours of stats every tuesday would suck but this man is great
Andrew,"man has started cracking borderline dad jokes 
""Helen - the face that launched a thousand ships, and from whom we get the objective measure of beauty;  the milihelen, enough beauty to launch one ship"""
Andrew,what a gOD
Andrew,someone in one of my classes has the most fantasy-sounding first name I've ever seen - their name is literally Bronwyn
Andrew,that is awesome
Andrew,no idea if it's a guy or girl
Andrew,"@Liberals Out of curiosity which of these people would be considered the most privileged, a gay white male, a straight black male, or a straight white female?"

Andrew,maybe
Andrew,NO
Andrew,Ava how do I get gud at pay
Andrew,Osu
Andrew,Jk osu is for gay retards with autism
Andrew,"how did you manage to mispell osu as pay?  it literally requires not only both hands to be in the wrong place, it then requires one hand to overcorrect and end up in a different wrong place"
Andrew,it's only three letters
Andrew,that is honestly impressive
Andrew,@trap kys
Andrew,osu is for cool weebs
Andrew,'cool weebs' is an oxymoron
Andrew,uH no
Andrew,you're a weeb too sylki
Andrew,did I ever profess or pretend coolness?
Andrew,o h
Andrew,Sylki on on mobile
Andrew,O is next to P
Andrew,S is next is A
Andrew,U is next to Y
Andrew,Also auto correct
Andrew,"the point was that o->p would put you towards the right, and u->y to the left"
Andrew,but mobile autocorrect makes sense
Andrew,Sylki
Andrew,Can you become my basement space
Andrew,lol
Andrew,Slave
Andrew,To do my hw
Andrew,God damnit auto correct
Andrew,the hell is going with your autocorrect

Andrew,so i threw it down
Andrew,and now its gone
Andrew,not in the headset or anywhere around it
Andrew,wtf
Andrew,and now its gonna take me 4 years to get the pads back on

Andrew,gross
Andrew,that was in my headset
Andrew,please delete your headset
Andrew,@Max @Trapezoider when are we gonna starcraft?
Andrew,I'm good whenever
Andrew,or just do something in general
Andrew,I vaguely remember we played once and you actually know what you're doing so I'm gonna advocate waiting for trap before we start
Andrew,thats fine
Andrew,@Trapezoider
Andrew,@Sak von Sak I steam messaged trap and we should be good to go when he is done with H1Z1
Andrew,sounds good
Andrew,What is your main race?
Andrew,protoss
Andrew,white
Andrew,dabbled in zerg but I don't really remember most of it
Andrew,I usually play Terran but I've considered swapping to Protoss
Andrew,i too dabbed on zerg
Andrew,my brother played terran and I vaguely remember swarms of marines and medevacs that were a bitch to deal with as protoss if I didn't have templars
Andrew,that can happen
Andrew,medivacs I think
Andrew,"shrugs I wouldn't really know, I was just mashing medicine and evacuate together"
Andrew,Evil Emperor Zurg?
Andrew,Woah
Andrew,also if I remember correctly the reason I ended up mostly not playing zerg was cause my brother and dad both played a lot of protoss and used mostly flying stuff that I couldn't seem to beat cause the only big zerg units could only hit ground -_-
Andrew,I'm sure there's a way around that but I have no idea what
Andrew,Hydralisks
Andrew,Corruptors
Andrew,Vipers
Andrew,"everying zerg is a -lisk, you'll have to remind me what all these things ar"
Andrew,are hydralisks the flapping things that shoot bouncing shots?
Andrew,no
Andrew,those are mutalisks
Andrew,those suck at anti air
Andrew,they are flying anti worker mainly
Andrew,shrugs for now I'll stick to protoss
Andrew,you should because if you do we will have all 3 races in our ffa
Andrew,noice
Andrew,diversity
Andrew,Diversity is our strenght. Socialism our goal. Equality our ideal. WE ARE LIBERALS!
Andrew,Yo Kameron you wanna play some Overwatch @Mr. Airplane

Andrew,alright
Andrew,hopefully you and trap finish around the same time
Andrew,@Sak von Sak @Trapezoider Before we start I'm going to give you guys a refresher on invisible/flying units so someone isn't crushed due to not knowing how to beat either of those things

Andrew,@Sak von Sak Is it possible to use a calculator to solve matrix's?
Andrew,You would probably need a sophisticated calculator to do so
Andrew,if you've got a graphing calculator
Andrew,there's definately some online stuff that'll do it for you tho
Andrew,My friends calculators have them
Andrew,well rip I don't
Andrew,"also, matrices is the plural of matrix"

Andrew,this game is amazing
Andrew,What platform is that game on?
Andrew,ps3 and ps4
Andrew,"seriously tho, the story's getting super awesome, plus I'm currently in a position gameplay-wise where I'm having to pull out all stops to try and not die and the way they're coinciding is making everything even crazier"
Andrew,"goddammit I'm basically out of mana and running low on mana-replenishing items, so I'm working with my team of mostly physical attackers and the boss KEEPS CASTING A THING THAT LETS HIM REFLECT PHYSICAL ATTACKS"

I don’t know any veterans who are college aged, but if I did I would definitely tell them about the veteran’s benefits they can receive. Getting a good job is probably the most common goal for college students. Everyone with this goal should pay a visit to the CASA building to see career counselors and advisors. The CASE building is definitely a fun place to hang out and play video games!"

Andrew,he had partial ownership of a goat while he was in the military and he loved it
Andrew,it was his platoon's goat
Andrew,Why does a platoon need a goat?

Andrew,@here gamezzz?
Andrew,rivals?
Andrew,sure
Andrew,be there in a second
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether any1 d0wn
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,be there in a second
Andrew,I just got home and I've got early classes so I'll pass
Andrew,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/177839064/
Andrew,"Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share"
Andrew,"Make games, stories and interactive art with Scratch. (scratch.mit.edu)"
Andrew,I am a master game dev now go try out my newest title 
Andrew,@Jed This gave me a 404 error
Andrew,oops
Andrew,idk
Andrew,Your game is broken bro
Andrew,I want to plaY it
Andrew,404 for you too?
Andrew,Ye
Andrew,What's it about
Andrew,try now
Andrew,works now for me
Andrew,its a work in progress
Andrew,did you actually make this?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,the jump distance seems to be inconsistent
Andrew,each jump goes the same height
Andrew,or did you mean the pipes?
Andrew,jumps
Andrew,nope each jump is 10 pixels
Andrew,I still have to add a scoreboard element and a background change
Andrew,Now I want to try making something
Andrew,scratch is fairly easy to learn
Andrew,no actual writing code
Andrew,its all in blocks for you to put together
Andrew,how do you get it to restart without reloading the page
Andrew,the green flag
Andrew,oh
Andrew,I could make a start button but that would be too much work
Andrew,l a z y
Andrew,wow this game is very hard
Andrew,its flappy bird
Andrew,but memes
Andrew,i am aware
Andrew,so my exam schedule just came out
Andrew,I didn't quite pay attention to which of my classes do and don't have exams
Andrew,"but as it turns out, I only have one exam"
Andrew,so that worked out well
Andrew,@Sak von Sak play rivals with me
Andrew,"in a bit, studying for a midterm atm"
Andrew,I will tho
Andrew,get in here jed
Andrew,ya big nerd
Andrew,@Max play the ow halloweeb event with us we need a fourth
Andrew,doing homework
Andrew,@Sak von Sak nice name
Andrew,cheers
Andrew,I figured I'd go with the theme
Andrew,but now that you're not supply depot anymore we need another supply depot
Andrew,I'm back to that
Andrew,yee
Andrew,lol
Andrew,@here ayy you guys wanna play some cs?
Andrew,maybe yesterday
Andrew,"gotta study and eat, but maybe later tonight"
Andrew,I'm checking out dust_new
Andrew,wanna queue with me?
Andrew,instead of checking out dust new
Andrew,Later maybe
Andrew,I might play
Andrew,In like a while
Andrew,RIP my awesome winter term schedule
Andrew,"dropped one of my courses for this term, replaced it with a different one next term (that everyone says is easier and the prof's not an ass, and where I can take either for my degree), and now I've lost my super easy schedule and no friday classes"
Andrew,Rip
Andrew,"on the flip side, at least this term should be manageable"
Andrew,cause that one course was occupying like half my time and I was doing terribly
Andrew,and I'd already gotten in a mini-fight with the prof
Andrew,Yeah that's no good
Andrew,What class is this?
Andrew,"digital systems, it's basically agressive circuitry and the nuts and bolts of how computers are put together"
Andrew,which should be super interesting
Andrew,I agree
Andrew,"but the prof subscribes to this ""innovative"" teaching model which is really good in theory - the dry lecture learning stuff is done outside of class, then class time is for application of what you've learned and you can ask questions and stuff really easily"
Andrew,the problem is that he kinda forgot about the whole applying stuff in class part
Andrew,"so it's pretty hard to make sense of anything cause a) first class after readings is a test on the readings without an opportunity to ask about anything you're confused about, then in between that and the other class of the week there's an ""in-class assignment"" which isn't done in class, and he doesn't reply to email questions about it so you still don't really know what you're doing for it, then the second class he takes up the test and stumbles around trying to answer questions about the actual content we're confused about"
Andrew,"on top of which, there's labs every couple of weeks, which are even more complicated, and by terrible scheduling, I have other lectures during almost all the open lab sections where you can show up and work with the TAs to get stuff done (the only one that I can show up to I can only show up to half an hour of it, which isn't enough), and the software we have to work on is super buggy on my computer and periodically just freezes and deletes whatever project I was working on if I kill it with task manager"
Andrew,"and when I asked him for an evening-long extention in light of this (was due at 4pm, but there was an open lab for it from 5-7 that night which I could go to), not only did he not give an extention, he also just gives instant zero to a late submission"
Andrew,and that was going to happen pretty much every lab
Andrew,so we got into a bit of an argument about that
Andrew,this is also the course where everyone is slowly bailing
Andrew,"I started out in a 5-person group, two people dropped, he mashed the remaining three together with two other groups so we then had an 8-person group, which has now dwindled to a 5-person group (4 now that I've dropped)"
Andrew,"td;dr - cool sounding course, prof butchered any reasonable chance of understanding it and is also stupidly rigid in how he handles things, about half the class has dropped and I'm incredibly happy to be part of that half"
Andrew,Sounds like hell
Andrew,Meanwhile I am sitting here trying to be productive during my unexpected 1 hour break by writing out code on my phone
Andrew,
Andrew,you really need a laptop
Andrew,Check it out
Andrew,I really do
Andrew,This is kind of painful
Andrew,I can imagine
Andrew,but seriously how are you doing the whole uni thing without a laptop?
Andrew,are you taking notes by hand?
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,It's not too bad
Andrew,It just sucks when I have these breaks
Andrew,"get a cheap laptop, do work during breaks"
Andrew,I spend most of my breaks off the corner of one of the libraries doing assignments or studying
Andrew,it's honestly really good for productivity
Andrew,you can probably get a laptop that does what you need for a couple hundred bucks at most
Andrew,somewhat related but Android studio makes me want to rip my toenails out
Andrew,@Sak von Sak I approve the switch back to your old (and obviously superior) profile picture
Andrew,eh I like them both but this one shows better in the discord bubble
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether games?
Andrew,I'm in
Andrew,Girls can now join the boy scouts
Andrew,...
Andrew,Yup
Andrew,I happen to remember something called the girl scouts existing so this seems pointless
Andrew,Girl scouts leadership ran it into the ground
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether games?
Andrew,in a few minutes
Andrew,"well rip me, 2-0'd one of my melee demons only to immediately lose my next two matches and not even make top 8"
Andrew,"on the flip side, my record against sasquatch is now 3-15"
Andrew,a marked improvement
Andrew,also I had a weird run through like all the people I usually fight
Andrew,"please let me fight someone other than sasquatch, dayman, and milk"
Andrew,I almost always fight two or more of them per tournament
Andrew,3/4 tournaments I've fought dayman and at least one of milk or sasquatch
Andrew,holy shit one of the compsci academic advisers here is named Erin Gunsinger and that might be the most badass name I've ever heard
Andrew,oh snap
Andrew,thats lit
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Andrew,COLLEGE APP DUE TOMORROW YOU FOOL
Andrew,don't worry about it i believe in doing everything at the literal last second
Andrew,SCREW YOU
Andrew,@games here?
Andrew,@here
Andrew,im down later
Andrew,@Jed gamezzz?
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Andrew,did you deafen me fusion?
Andrew,I got through the entire starcraft brood war soundtrack (47:50) 3 and a half times while doing homework. Why must it be so long.
Andrew,are Koth maps bo3 now ? in comp ?
Andrew,indeed my dude
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,anime
Andrew,my dude
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,SLEEP
Andrew,SOON
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,LEAVE ME ALONE
Andrew,@Sak von Sak sleep is for the week
Andrew,@Sak von Sak would you rather sleep or watch anime i already know its watch anime to comoooon
Andrew,grumble
Andrew,what would we watc
Andrew,"black clover, my hero academia, monster"
Andrew,I've already watched like all of mha
Andrew,at least all that's dubbed
Andrew,"ew Sylki, you refuse to watch subbed even if thats all there is ? ? ?"
Andrew,no that's not what I said
Andrew,I've watched a lot of things that have only sub
Andrew,sounds like it
Andrew,and a lot of subs for stuff where I didn't like the dub
Andrew,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Andrew, An error occurred: Error: socket hang up
Andrew,"also ava just to clarify that discussion cause I wasn't paying a ton of attention (and was also like half asleep), MHA has simultaneous sub and dub, the dub is really good but delayed by about a week, which I'm willing to wait"
Andrew,o h  I see
Andrew,Is being straight kinda gay
Andrew,i mean think about it
Andrew,you're into someone who sucks dick
Andrew,@Sak von Sak rivals in 30?
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,eh sure
Andrew,we could do a 4 man tourney if @Max is down
Andrew,yee
Andrew,@Max you down my dude?
Andrew,octagon why
Andrew,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Andrew,I can't tell if you just did that as a counterpoint to my name or if you're carefully avoiding Zack Attack
Andrew,Doing school reading. We'll see if i can play or not.
Andrew,the world may never know
Andrew,people only play ori now and its annoying as hell
Andrew,ori's kinda broke
Andrew,and easier rushdown than wrastor
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Andrew,"kk, gonna make a bathroom run first"
Andrew,Can't sorry busy with school work
Andrew,just play anyways
Andrew,read while playing=profit
Andrew,do school later
Andrew,no
Andrew,ez
Andrew,
Andrew,also if we do a tourney you can play during offtime
Andrew,@Max doki doki literature club?????
Andrew,what?
Andrew,it says you're playing it
Andrew,It's more important than his schoolwork
Andrew,I just finished my school work
Andrew,then join us my dude
Andrew,eh
Andrew,mini tourney
Andrew,I only have like 25-30 minutes of free time before I need to start on more school
Andrew,that's enough time
Andrew,ye
Andrew,Ava's comments on this game make me want to continue
Andrew,we wanna see where everyone stands in skill rn
Andrew,and octagon's like good at this game now
Andrew,keeping it close with me in kragg dittos
Andrew,I know I've played him a lot
Andrew,come on you can play it whenever
Andrew,Also I'll lose because you are all warm and my first 5 or so games I suck
Andrew,wrastor is hard man
Andrew,we'll open with round robin
Andrew,"and then top two play for 1st, bottom two play for 3rd"
Andrew,Another time
Andrew,bruh
Andrew,I don't feel up to it right now
Andrew,and I know it will take longer than I have
Andrew,30 MINUTES HUH
Andrew,dear friendo
Andrew,if you don't want to play with us
Andrew,just say so
Andrew,don't make them excuses
Andrew,Miraculous Youngster is a beast ow team

Andrew,"@Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane I started my assignment at 11:00 which is almost exactly 30 minutes after I sent my message. I do not lie and I did indeed have a school assignment to do. After I finished it, you guys were playing csgo which I had no interest in therefore I didn't feel the need to say anything about finishing. I don't make things up or lie. If I simply didn't want to play I would have said so, like I do whenever Overwatch is suggested. In those cases I'm sure you can remember many ""no I don't want to""'s. If you want I can even screenshot my ceritficate of completion of the assignment that I am emailed if you do not believe me."
Andrew, best emote
Andrew,
Andrew,"K fair @Max, you can understand our assumption tho"
Andrew,"Yeah I understand, I just wanted to clarify my innocence."
Andrew,Idk still seems shday to me
Andrew,"on an unrelated note, who's down to do a 5-queue with our names as Zack Attack, Zack Defense, Zack Sp. Attack, Zack Sp. Defense, and Zack Speed? @Cs:go"
Andrew,"not now, but like, tonight some time"
Andrew,I call Zack Speed
Andrew,Yee
Andrew,also I have more work tonight so maybe not
Andrew,we'll see
Andrew,I'm doing math now but I have a paper later
Andrew,we'll see I guess
Andrew,try to get as much done as you can
Andrew,btw I'm going to be carving my profile picture into a pumpkin for halloween
Andrew,the terran crest?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,that's pretty sweet
Andrew,Its probably my favorite faction logo of all time
Andrew,"all the sc ones are pretty sick, personally I prefer the protoss one"
Andrew,go figure
Andrew,its also cool
Andrew,"I'm also pretty partial to the persona 5 player faction/crew logo, though it's not the kind of thing you can engrave on a pumpkin, at least not easily"
Andrew,thats in interesting one
Andrew,it's also kinda weird cause you don't actually get a character who wears a hat until pretty late in the game
Andrew,and it's not even really a top hat
Andrew,@Sak von Sak  I just started doki doki and i'm so on edge because the only thing i've heard about it is what you put in the memes channel
Andrew,lol
Andrew,I haven't gotten far enough for anything to actually happen either
Andrew,but I'm terrified of everything
Andrew,Its quite an experience
Andrew,and there's this tiny part of me that thinks it might all just be a huge meme and it's actually a totally normal story and they just got everyone to say it goes hard in the psychological horror
Andrew,which would be really funny
Andrew,but I'm hoping that doesn't happen
Andrew,
Andrew,oh dang I have to write a poem?
Andrew,yup
Andrew,it doesn't have to make sense
Andrew,just do what I did and choose your favourite word from each page and see where it ends you up
Andrew,or be super tactical and choose the ones you think will impress your future waifu(?)
Andrew,you guys gotta pick words to please a specific girl!!
Andrew,^ was about to say that
Andrew,yea
Andrew,WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBS
Andrew,"yeah I noticed, but they jump when I pick darker words"
Andrew,I picked based that way and 16/20 seemed to make the purple hair girl happy so.... shrugs
Andrew,
Andrew,I think they jump for the stuff they like
Andrew,yes
Andrew,
Andrew,THATS STILL SPOOKY
Andrew,also I've barely gotten past the poem bit so don't say anything that happens after that
Andrew,got it
Andrew,"except maybe who ended up the happiest from your poem, cause curiosity"
Andrew,spoiler-free catholic discord
Andrew,yeah I wanna know too :0
Andrew,whoever you choose the most words for you spend the day with at the club before reading poems
Andrew,well obviously i'm going for yuri because she's best girl
Andrew,nO
Andrew,ew
Andrew,Natsuki > Sayori > Yuri
Andrew,wow
Andrew,i guess it's ok to be wrong
Andrew,Sayori > Natsuki > Yuri
Andrew,Natsuki is a weeb and a tsundere ! ! Tsunderes are funny characters
Andrew,natsuki is trash
Andrew,Yuri is trash
Andrew,no u
Andrew,chill
Andrew,in the small portion I've played I'm gonna have to agree with smithy here
Andrew,oh boy
Andrew,aaAAAAA
Andrew,not necessarily on the best girl part cause I'm not far enough to have an opinion on that yet
Andrew,but on the fact that natsuki seems annoying
Andrew,shes funny imo
Andrew,shrug
Andrew,I don;t like tsunderes
Andrew,"the general archetype works fine, it's just when it's played totally straight that it's annoying"
Andrew,"you can either use it as a small part of the character (see: kurisu in steins gate), or blow it wildly out of proportion for comedic purposes (see: nichijou)"
Andrew,"wait, who's the tsundere in nichijou?"
Andrew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQq5d6v59xg

Andrew,oh right I totally forgot about her lol
Andrew,literally the most tsundere character I've ever seen
Andrew,welp
Andrew,"in an epic lack of proper group communication (my fault as well), two separate group members each did about half of the project"
Andrew,now we're gonna have to compare and see whose stuff to keep
Andrew,You mean you split into 2 teams and each did the same half?
Andrew,naw we just figured we'd get started on it before discussing it with the group (I didn't bother telling them cause they didn't start early last time and I just dropped a 2/3 finished project on them and said do the rest and that worked out just fine)
Andrew,but we both decided to start and not tell anyone
Andrew,oh okay
Andrew,Mine would have been funnier
Andrew,and cause it's programming it's entirely possible that even if we did exactly opposite halves we won't be able to just mush them together
Andrew,well it does look like we did nearly opposite halves
Andrew,so at least it'll be easier than if we'd both done totally different parts
Andrew,"@Rivals of Aether My opinions on each characters worst matchup                                                  Wrastor>Maypul
Zetterburn>Wrastor
Absa>Kragg
Etalus>Zetterburn
Orcane>Etalus
Kragg>Orcane
Zetterburn>Absa
No apparent counter>Forsburn"
Andrew,btw Good in matchup>Character being countered
Andrew,not sure about the kragg > orcane thing
Andrew,In my experience it is true because he can power through bubbles
Andrew,his only way to power through bubbles is sideb
Andrew,which is really easy to counter
Andrew,thats enough
Andrew,you can get through and immediately put yourself in a terrible position
Andrew,worst matchup does not mean bad
Andrew,its cause max always beats me in that matchup 
Andrew,I don't think orcane has any matchups that are very bad at all
Andrew,altought i agree that kragg counters orcane for the following reasons
Andrew,all of his moves slightly outrange or outprioritize orcanes options
Andrew,"I feel like zetter, absa do better against orcane"
Andrew,orcanes biggest strength is edgegarding and kragg cant be edgeguarded
Andrew,you can't out-camp absa with bubbles
Andrew,orcane beats both of them imo
Andrew,the weight matchup is wierd
Andrew,rocks>bubbles
Andrew,and I dunno if zetter's actually good but I randomly pulled my half-decent zetter and beat kameron
Andrew,if you get hit by kragg as orcane you're pretty much dead
Andrew,eh only if he's got the right setups in place
Andrew,like only if I can bully you offstage into rock rock rock rock
Andrew,Kragg gets huge punishes of almost everything
Andrew,^
Andrew,you just have not figured it out yet
Andrew,yes but I feel like he blows at getting in
Andrew,his biggest weakness is his approach sucks
Andrew,i kinda disagree
Andrew,eh
Andrew,His approach is fine
Andrew,my defense on orcane is just good
Andrew,speaking of rivals anyone wanna play
Andrew,im down after dinner
Andrew,I'm down
Andrew,lol maybe in a little bit
Andrew,4 man tourney les go bois
Andrew,maybe we'll get that 4-man tourney going
Andrew,surprised one challenged my forsburn statement
Andrew,i have to do it soonish tho
Andrew,none of us know forsburn
Andrew,^
Andrew,i think he gets countered by iceguy
Andrew,he can combo etalus really well but maybe
Andrew,"generally speaking though, my general reasoning for why kragg >>> orcane doesn't entirely hold up is just from fighting kameron a ton, going more or less even with my kragg and then doing about the same with my worse characters"
Andrew,which doesn't quite make sense
Andrew,you put orcane >>> etalus and my etalus usually does alright
Andrew,Kameron plays against 3 Kragg players and is just good at the matchup
Andrew,well i have tons of practice against kragg
Andrew,fair
Andrew,also yeah we have all kind of gravitated over to the rock beetle
Andrew,I'm going to make a more detailed ROA stats/opinions list shortly
Andrew,also I've gotta say I love octagon's kragg
Andrew,it's got the same dumb reads I get only more
Andrew,although as soon as I started reading his reads things went downhill
Andrew,cause he goes for the same reads a lot
Andrew,ill be there at 7 and then we can do a 4 man tourney
Andrew,@Sak von Sak GET IN HERE BOIIII
Andrew,finishing a bagel then I'm in
Andrew,@Sak von Sak how long does it take to eat a bagel?
Andrew,long time
Andrew,is actually several bagels
Andrew,with a bunch of stuff on them
Andrew,"I just got my first ""ending"" and I don't know how I feel"
Andrew,"good job, queen's 
http://www.cp24.com/news/330-charges-laid-33-arrested-during-homecoming-at-queen-s-university-1.3634572"
Andrew,"330 charges laid, 33 arrested during homecoming at Queen's University"
Andrew,"Police say they laid hundreds of charges during Queen's University homecoming celebrations in Kingston, Ont., over the weekend."
Andrew,"and I'm assuming one of those would involve one the brother of one of my housemates, who got stabbed in the face"
Andrew,"(he's fine, more or less, but he'll probably have a scar)"
Andrew,good old homecoming
Andrew,props on them for doubling the numbers
Andrew,on them?
Andrew,to them?
Andrew,I think 'to them'
Andrew,^
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,unfortunatley I care not enough to fix my bad grammar
Andrew,@Sak von Sak friendlies?
Andrew,sure
Andrew,get in here nerd
Andrew,"sec, bathrooming first"
Andrew,"This is very important
Some guy on our team was 1-13 and we're like ""Darius you're shit at this game""
AND THIS MAN GOES ""Oh yeah well i can speak 2 languages"""
Andrew,"like good for you, you still suck ass at league dont play ranked"
Andrew,Gottem
Andrew,Welp today's the day we get new rivals characters and I've got lectures and meetings till 930 and a few tests to study for
Andrew,rip
Andrew,I actually have my first class off
Andrew,So I'm testing the new characters right now
Andrew,Clairen is super fun
Andrew,Ranno as seems fun
Andrew,general playstles?
Andrew,Clairen looks like she will be a all around character. Her neutral and punishes both look good. Ranno looks to be a powerhouse on stage that will be easily gimped.
Andrew,first impressions
Andrew,I have a feeling there is going to be at least 1 character (I'm thinking absa at the moment) who is going to do AWEFUL against Clairen.
Andrew,do either of them have the nice movement à la zetterburn?
Andrew,"mostly clairen, I enjoy not getting gimped a ton so I feel like I'll probably like her more"
Andrew,Froggy boi seems op
Andrew,"all in all, we need more non-kragg mains in this discord so maybe this will help"
Andrew,Yeah I'ma get the dlc
Andrew,"we basically have two and a half kraggs, one and a half orcanes, and a wrastor"
Andrew,I'm kinda an everything
Andrew,yeah but your kragg's probably your best
Andrew,"maybe I'll adjust down to just two kraggs - me, kinda you, kinda max"
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether If anyone wants to help me test Ranno and Clairen just @me.
Andrew,The amount of creative potential present in Clairen's increased hitpause on tipper is huge.

Andrew,we needed a hype falcon
Andrew,nah
Andrew,too many falcons

Andrew,I'm pretty sure S2J has never done better than 0-2 at summit
Andrew,he really shouldnt go
Andrew,i just wish pewpewu got the w
Andrew,what about the eight foxes (and m2k's kind of a fox)
Andrew,that's literally half the summit

Fox - 8
Falco - 1
Marth - 1
Sheik - 3
Puff - 1
Peach - 1
Falcon - 2
Luigi - 1
Yoshi - 1"
Andrew,the best part is that a fox probably wont win
Andrew,unless you count armada
Andrew,which I did
Andrew,the real dream is amsa winning
Andrew,no
Andrew,"the highest paying tourney, ever"
Andrew,m2k winning is the dream
Andrew,"just, surprise yoshi wins"
Andrew,"rough order of what I want to see: Amsa, Plup, Hax, Blea Gelo, S2J, Axe"
Andrew,pulpW
Andrew,@Sak von Sak rivals in 30????

Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,I'm still eating
Andrew,i cry
Andrew,it's only been like 25 minutes
Andrew,I'm torn between finishing this and not
Andrew,cause it's so good
Andrew,but I'm so full
Andrew,and it's so salty
Andrew,what is it?
Andrew,there's like no moisture left in my mouth
Andrew,I made the most badass sandwich
Andrew,"i say, toss it in da trash"
Andrew,and come play with me
Andrew,"I cooked a bunch of beef and mushrooms in garlic butter, those + turkey + boursin on a pretzel bun"
Andrew,unbelievably good
Andrew,you know whats even better
Andrew,playing roa
Andrew,fine I'll do a quick bathroom run then fight you

Andrew,Same
Andrew,I want to drop it so bad
Andrew,colour me throroughly confuzzled
Andrew,Shh it's fine
Andrew,I'm confused too
Andrew,Bout why we have a league channel
Andrew,I think foosion still plays every now and then
Andrew,But with who?
Andrew,inappropriate name
Andrew,actually his name
Andrew,oh yeah I've seen him a few times
Andrew,I thought you just like didn't want to type his name 
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,yeah?
Andrew,your dad and I have something new to get along about
Andrew,Factorio
Andrew,neat
Andrew,that game is amazing
Andrew,I'm doing a research paper on the safety and usefulness of GMO foods

Andrew,World's Best Smash 4 Player Is Worn Down By Haters And Harassment
Andrew,"For 13 minutes, Gonzalo “Zero” Barrios’ face barely moved. It was the Grand Finals match of a Super Smash Bros. Wii U tournament, and Barrios, the best Smash player in the world, was squaring off against a formidable opponent. A few feet away, Barrios’ bodyguard kept a lookout for a man who’d threatened to be there, in wait, with a gun aimed at the champion gamer."
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane Someone asked me to tutor them how much should I charge?
Andrew,"I don't know what a reasonable amount is, but make sure you start by asking what they'd be willing to pay first, in case it's way more than what you were gonna ask for"
Andrew,also depends on what you're doing
Andrew,i charge people $5 to look at their completed code if it doesnt work and i fix it
Andrew,one guy literally just forgot to indent something
Andrew,i hit the tab key once and got $5
Andrew,but if its something more important and difficult like physics definetly raise ur price
Andrew,also little haggling tip if they tell you to make an offer always ask more than you want
Andrew,that way when you lower your price to what you want they feel like they're getting a deal
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether games?
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,What is it?
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,rivals?
Andrew,not until my rehabilitation (spelling?) is complete
Andrew,oh
Andrew,@Sak von Sak play some RoA with me my dude

Andrew,@Max I now am able to accept the rivals skill gap as you have 198 hours compared to my 39
Andrew,well I got to my first ending in doki doki literature club
Andrew,conclusion - should not have done this right before going to bed
Andrew,What did you think of the game?
Andrew,also did you see the title screen after finishing
Andrew,Yup
Andrew,Title screen was fucked
Andrew,I  don't really consider that me finishing the game
Andrew,I'm not letting it end like that
Andrew,yeah you gotta play more
Andrew,it only gets better from here
Andrew,canada cup's looking pretty damn good
Andrew,"we've already got armada, leffen, m2k signed up"
Andrew,why do we need blea gelo at summit when the best luigi in the world is already attending
Andrew,because the best luigi in the world doesn't play luigi
Andrew,this is true

Andrew,and hella salty
Andrew,I just did worse than I ever have at a kingston tournament
Andrew,and then proceeded to play like two hours of salty fox dittos
Andrew,I have reached an impressive level of simmering anger at this point
Andrew,nah just do it
Andrew,play me fool
Andrew,I GOT 17TH
Andrew,I DID WORSE THAN SENDO
Andrew,AND I LOST TO BUCKTOWN
Andrew,yeah but you can get first in the 1v1 against me in rivals

Andrew,ecksdee
Andrew,still pretty annoyed because I'm usually super consistent and I just played like ass today
Andrew,and there's a monthly tomorrow and my confidence has gone down the drain
Andrew,"lololol I was on commentary for a bit on the stream, I watched a bit and due to our shitty mic it sounds like I have some super weird accent that's a blend of like scottish and australian"
Andrew,@Rotomotorz do you want to do 5 tp mission
Andrew,i already did
Andrew,@everyone Sylki and I are currently hosting a creative writing project. In this project we are going to be agreeing on a basic story premise and taking turns writing chapters after that. We already have 4 people and are looking for 1 more so please PM me if you're interested. We are looking to make a serious story so if you plan on meming your way through it don't bother signing up.
Andrew,"Sylki, that's just how you sound normally"
Andrew,What do you mean?
Andrew,look up a couple of messages
Andrew,I was replying to his earlier statement
Andrew,"also, I did better at the monthly (waaaay more stacked) than the weekly -_-"
Andrew,wait the pyro has a jetpack now\
Andrew,ok
Andrew,It's shit
Andrew,It's really really bad
Andrew,okay but like
Andrew,still
Andrew,I've been playing all of yesterday and today
Andrew,@Max I met a good wrastor
Andrew,"welp at the monthly, top 8 was initially 5/8 kingston people, and now we've reached top 3 and it's just the out of town people"
Andrew,"also top two seeds from my pool both made top eight, backing up my claim that I got the hardest pool"
Andrew,"except maybe the ryan ford, sandman, sasquatch pool"
Andrew,that one was pretty viscious
Andrew,@everyone I need a new headset anyone have any legit suggestions
Andrew,"I've got a razer kraken, it's pretty good"
Andrew,thats what i got right now
Andrew,i was gonna get another one unless i got a better suggestion

Andrew,ok fine later
Andrew,@Max what were you gonna say my dude
Andrew,I was going to say you should know not to disturb those in the literature club
Andrew,im guessing you dont want to play rivals
Andrew,Hyperx cloud 2's
Andrew,MAX YOU'RE SCARING ME
Andrew,why?
Andrew,I just meant that most people playing DDLC don't want to stop because they want to see what happens
Andrew,this game's scary enough without slightly suspect phrasing outside it too
Andrew,@Jed fite me
Andrew,no
Andrew,@Max i downloaded starcraft
Andrew,"Doing something, I'll be there soon"
Andrew,not too soon though
Andrew,Sylki and I can teach you
Andrew,I barely get what I'm doing

Andrew,test proctor
Andrew,gottem
Andrew,rekeronied
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether I beat someone on the ladder who had around 1200 rank points!
Andrew,Noice
Andrew,"My group for one of my classes is writing a report, one section is on ""issues and lessons learned"", and one thing that happened was we asked our assigned TA - a guy named Hang - for help and advice on part of our presentation (which was a required thing) and he didn't get back to us for like a week, literally until the evening before the presentation and after we'd handed in the slides and couldn't change them anymore.  We're having a dilemma on whether we should phrase that problem as ""he left us Hanging."""
Andrew,Fucking Hang
Andrew,he was actually super nice
Andrew,"but at the same time, he'd better be given that he left us hanging for a week and we ended up handing in slides with a few major mistakes"
Andrew,"also, high quality google docs recognizes all of these names except one"
Andrew,how does it recognize Sandarusi but not Mallany?
Andrew,the glock is better than the deagle because it has more bullets
Andrew,Is that why the zeus is the worst weapon
Andrew,
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,thats why you never buy armour
Andrew,it has 0 bullets
Andrew,True
Andrew,Yo
Andrew,You wanna help me code
Andrew,Tru
Andrew,no
Andrew,Go away Jed
Andrew,gottem
Andrew,what do you need help with?
Andrew,"""I don't see why you have such a huge problem with this, it's super common""
""So was the plague."""
Andrew,I am making a timer thingy
Andrew,in what language tho
Andrew,processing
Andrew,
Andrew,xd
Andrew,i would help but i gotta do college apps
Andrew,@Sak von Sak help doctor
Andrew,You baited me
Andrew,but i said no tho
Andrew,Baited
Andrew,I'm writing a report atm
Andrew,big group thing
Andrew,Double baited
Andrew,can help him later tho
Andrew,never used processing tho
Andrew,The logic of the code still applies
Andrew,chudat fox
Andrew,ez
Andrew,vs m2k ganon
Andrew,Woah
Andrew,ye that actually happened
Andrew,AND NOW ITS MANGO MARIO VS AXE YUNG LINK
Andrew,Of all the days to have a 5-hour group meeting and then go to the gym
Andrew,Sounds like I'm missing some hype stuff
Andrew,axe op
Andrew,why is he sticking to falco
Andrew,i dunno

Andrew,monkaS

Andrew,ye boi
Andrew,rip chu
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,happy birthday tomorrow bro
Andrew,Update your steam wish llist
Andrew,FeelsBirthdayMan
Andrew,
Andrew,Happy 17
Andrew,but for real update that wishlist boiiii
Andrew,I do not require games
Andrew,this match is nuts
Andrew,I've been thinking and I think its possible we will have more fun at a meetup if we don't go to an event. Does anyone else think this may be the case?
Andrew,"the meetup might be more fun, but if I'm paying for travel and a hotel I'd prefer to get both that and an event out of it"
Andrew,if we need to schedule it so that we can all come and it doesn't line up with an event I'm fine with that too
Andrew,im kinda with max on this one
Andrew,but an event would be fun tho
Andrew,would it have to be an event with melee tho?
Andrew,probably since that is the only game that enough of us play
Andrew,also the only game we could enter as well as spectate
Andrew,Someone could bring their laptop for rivals?
Andrew,I could
Andrew,I'm sure someone else could as well for multiple setups
Andrew,That's be dope
Andrew,Idk if I can come though
Andrew,i could prolly run roa on my surface XD
Andrew,I could bring mine
Andrew,but me being able to go is gonna depend on a whole bunch of stuff
Andrew,I'd need to get an internship over the summer and be able to take some time off
Andrew,Depends on the price for me
Andrew,well we should try to make it happen bois
Andrew,we've been planning something like this for 1.5 years now
Andrew,agreed
Andrew,Yeah I'm saving up to move out though so I have to decide if I'm willing to spend
Andrew,And set myself back
Andrew,to move out???
Andrew,why would you move out
Andrew,I'll be 18 in a yeat
Andrew,yeah but why would you want to move out
Andrew,I'm ready to be independent
Andrew,you've got a free home w/ utilities and food and everything
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,its not ideal but it is super practical
Andrew,I mean basically I get rekt if my parents find out
Andrew,So if that happens leaving will be necessary
Andrew,it's something you should take advantage of until you have a consistent source of money that can cover your rent and food and utilities
Andrew,Thats called addiction folks
Andrew,Willing to alter your life for a substance
Andrew,No
Andrew,That's one reason
Andrew,also that's not the definition of addiction by a long shot
Andrew,^
Andrew,addiction is defined by a physical and mental dependance on a substance
Andrew,I'm aware thats not the definition
Andrew,If I get a roommate or 2 I could cover rent rn
Andrew,I'm just ready to be on my own
Andrew,"also, just a recommendation, don't just drop this on your family out of the blue"
Andrew,Idk my family is great and I love them
Andrew,so tell them
Andrew,don't make it a surprise
Andrew,I will
Andrew,or they'll be incredibly pissed
Andrew,OR just dont and stay with them
Andrew,Breaks over boiz
Andrew,breaks?
Andrew,I'm loving how all the dreamhack trophies are breaking
Andrew,did Hbox's break?
Andrew,someone's buying cheap trophies
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,the base came off
Andrew,lol
Andrew,https://twitter.com/LiquidHbox/status/922288824620695553
Andrew,sigh
Andrew,also do you guys think hbox is #1 in world rn?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,me too
Andrew,yeah he's going pretty ham
Andrew,also s2j definitely top 10 at this point
Andrew,even though I think he's boring
Andrew,but do I really wanna play doki doki
Andrew,also @Mr. Airplane I was on break at work
Andrew,Play it
Andrew,Play it
Andrew,@The Rona How far are you?
Andrew,This is a fun game
Andrew,Yuri is coming over to my house today
Andrew,hawt
Andrew,❤
Andrew,I chose Natsuki
Andrew,Ew
Andrew,We got to make cupcakes
Andrew,so this is a dating sim?
Andrew,it looks like one but it really isn't
Andrew,its a psychological horror game
Andrew,It needs to be played blind so don't look up stuff about it
Andrew,is it a sound based game?
Andrew,smell?
Andrew,its a visual novel
Andrew,do I need to provide my own blindfold?
Andrew,how do I play a visual novel blind?
Andrew,bad game design imo
Andrew,you really don't need to take that out of context
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,but it was funny
Andrew,btw @The Rona I only chose Natsuki because Sayori wasn't an option. She was my favorite.
Andrew,why the heck is everyone so obsessed with Yuri
Andrew,shes dumb
Andrew,I'm not sure
Andrew,Once everyone has completed the game I'm going to make a poll
Andrew,Yo I read a book with Yuri ok
Andrew,best girl poll?
Andrew,She liked my poem
Andrew,You do things with whichever girl liked your poem
Andrew,So if a different one had you would have done something with her
Andrew,shhhhhhhh
Andrew,Maybe
Andrew,not maybe its a fact
Andrew,I wanted Monika but then I realised that she wasn't an option
Andrew,;-;
Andrew,lol
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether someone fight me real quick
Andrew,Fuck me this game
Andrew,Oh poor doctor
Andrew,You ain't seen nothing yet
Andrew,how long is the game?
Andrew,This just got super weird

Andrew,Happy birthday!!  @Jed
Andrew,they grow up so fast 
Andrew,Can it be considered growing up when Kameron's testosterone levels stay negative every year
Andrew,"so for a big group project, we have do peer reviews where we basically give all our group members marks based on how good they were, and we have to write a paragraph or so for each of them explaining why we gave those marks"
Andrew,which is a pain
Andrew,but at least the sample paragraphs are hilarious
Andrew,here are a few samples:
Andrew,"""Candorsnaffity Hixelbröd was an annoying teammate"""
Andrew,"""he agreed that he'd do the sushi-ionization module by Sunday afternoon"""
Andrew,"""Prosnitau Sgrachita de la Mnirhoihoi was good, helpful and co-operative."""
Andrew,"""V'snl'chm'tkn!k of the Fortress of Doom (that's me) was an effective worker in this
assignment"""
Andrew,"also I just skimmed over the way you're supposed to break down marks (that I totally ignored initially), which contains this gem: A mark of seven indicates someone who leaps tall buildings in a single bound, walks on water, and solves NP-complete problems in linear time."
Andrew,@here gamerinos anyone???
Andrew,Yee
Andrew,@Sak von Sak play dem games with me and birthday boi
Andrew,@Max you too
Andrew,gotta finish these stupid peer reviews
Andrew,just do it later
Andrew,boom problem solved
Andrew,it's due tonight
Andrew,I already left it to the last minute
Andrew,Doki Doki is okie doki
Andrew,     
Andrew,same
Andrew,"My stats prof: ""Just then, you assumed that I was telling the truth, because what I was saying was plausible.  Just like how you assume I have the credentials to teach this course."""
Andrew,Same
Andrew,The teachers are on strike where I live and i am not getting compensation for the missed school even though i paid for it if you guys can take like 1 minutes jsut to fill out this petition giving students compensation for missed days i will personally suck your dick and give you a high five at the same time https://www.change.org/p/college-employer-council-students-demand-a-tuition-refund-for-each-day-missed-in-case-of-an-ontario-college-strike/nftexp/ex15/v6/818679301?recruiter=818679301&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial.combo_new_control_progress_bar&utm_content=ex15%3Av6
Andrew,Sign the Petition
Andrew,College Employer Council: Students demand a tuition refund for each day missed in case of an Ontario college strike
Andrew,damn they're on strike again?
Andrew,"not as sure about college profs, but for uni and high school they have an insanely good setup"
Andrew,"as in high pay, low hours, good benefits"
Andrew,and they still strike
Andrew,"the people a year older than me got screwed for uni applications cause the public school board teachers aren't legally allowed to strike, so the union just strongarmed all the teachers into stopping extracurriculars so basically everyone who was applying to post-secondary stuff had a big empty extracurricular section on all their applications"
Andrew,the worst part is that most teachers didn't even want to do it but you can't teach in a public school without being part of the union so they had no choice
Andrew,and the union's pretty screwed up even when no one's going on strike
Andrew,"one of the major things is that your ability to get placed where you want is based 100% on seniority, so if you're an awful teacher who's been around for 30 years you can teach what you want, where you want, and if you're a brand new teacher living paycheck to paycheck you probably can't even get a job"
Andrew,"one of my uncles has been a teacher for six years, he couldn't get a job for the first three years except as a substitute teacher or an LTO (long term occasional, basically if a teacher goes on maternity or sick leave for awhile he would come in and pick up a poorly documented class for a few months then he'd be out of a job again), then he got a really good slot for a year.... only to get kicked out by someone with more seniority and he had to spend the next two years at a place for kids who've been expelled or are in juvie but can't technically not get school (read: everyone's an asshole and/or doesn't give a fuck and it's in the middle of a super dangerous area) before he's finally managed to get a decent placement and who knows how long that's gonna last, cause based on their system by the end of the year he'll only have 4 years of seniority"
Andrew,Teachers unions are just terrible
Andrew,Looks like we agree on one more thing
Andrew,"some unions are alright, especially in dangerous jobs (like factory work), but a) unions in public funded areas are generally terrible cause they're fairly essential services where it has a large, negative impact on society if and when they strike, b) teachers already have a pretty damn cushy gig and really, really don't need a union, and c) this union in particular has a tendancy to kinda sorta work against the best interests of its members in an attempt to make things marginally better for a small handful of them"
Andrew,holy shit
Andrew,I leave this chat for a couple weeks and come back to find deep discussion on politics
Andrew,nice
Andrew,Welcome back
Andrew,hey boys
Andrew,yee
Andrew,@Max

Andrew,Its going good
Andrew,Is there a new build I could play tonight?
Andrew,ooh ooh play with me later
Andrew,I was planning on patching it soon
Andrew,maybe I can get the new build together today
Andrew,yes @Sak von Sak
Andrew,I can't now tho
Andrew,just took an hour-long melee break
Andrew,and I've got a midterm at 7
Andrew,is anyone here getting destiny 2? It looks kinda gay but im down if you guys get it
Andrew,oh
Andrew,rip
Andrew,how difficult are exams?
Andrew,also @Max @Sak von Sak college life is crazy
Andrew,gotta love it though
Andrew,I just took a midterm and it was pretty easy
Andrew,"I'm not that worried, I've done a ton of old midterms and I basically know every questions he's gonna throw at me"
Andrew,we're allowed a cheat sheet too
Andrew,thats OP
Andrew,I want a cheat sheet
Andrew,honestly I'm usually more worried about tests where they let you have a cheat sheet
Andrew,cause that means it's hard
Andrew,true
Andrew,"and it's gonna be more questions testing your understanding and application than your knowledge, which is really all the cheat sheet helps with"
Andrew,I got a cheat sheet for my math midterm and I didn't even need it
Andrew,@Trapezoider Even if I don't make a new build today the build we are on will be new for you
Andrew,@Trapezoider you should get a copy of the cards and make a few decks before we play
Andrew,I sent him the pdf
Andrew,"just to warn him tho, there's a few cards with two versions in the pdf (at least if it's the same one I've got) and a bunch of unimplemented/banned cards"
Andrew,woah
Andrew,"from what I remember, knight, scholar, goblin, and berserker are banned atm due to being more than a little OP, there's two versions of stasis chamber (I think the actual one is the one with 1 attack), two grand arbiters (3-cost one is the real one), wild magic is banned, power cultivation might be banned, replicator is banned or at the very least it's getting removed next patch, time walk shouldn't exist anymore, and once there stop being pictures for stuff everything unimplemented"
Andrew,at least in my version
Andrew,Power cultivation isn't banned
Andrew,He has the same version as you @Sak von Sak
Andrew,oh I thought it was
Andrew,my bad
Andrew,Tonights games will probably be the final testing before 1.18 is implemented
Andrew,I found another good wrastor
Andrew,he wrecked me the first few games but I brought it back
Andrew,The mythical good wrastor player
Andrew,many deny the very existence of such a player
Andrew,@Sak von Sak @Trapezoider @me when you want to play MCG and I'll set up the server
Andrew,"I just finished my midterm, I'm gonna get a pizza (which will put me over budget for the week but fuck it I deserve a pizza) and then I'm down to play"
Andrew,"it won't actually put me much over budget cause pizza pizza has a clutch deal - large pizza, 3 toppings, dipping sauce, $13 including tax"
Andrew,and I can just bring the couple of leftover slices for lunch tomorrow and save some there
Andrew,pizza pizza coming in clutch
Andrew,@Trapezoider fight me mcg
Andrew,@Trapezoider you're letting me down
Andrew,@here games?

Andrew,@Sak von Sak I think I've figured out a better way to deal with your trap from yesterday
Andrew,there's a lot of good ways around it
Andrew,but even if you block it I force you to waste a turn blocking it
Andrew,and I get at least a knight and a bishop out
Andrew,Raven ate the entire stem off of one of our pumpkins lol
Andrew,Eww
Andrew,Why did you just call her Raven?
Andrew,ha
Andrew,thats my dog's name
Andrew,Oh
Andrew,No that's Ava
Andrew,Stop lying
Andrew,I didn't mean Ava if some of you thought that
Andrew,We all know she craves pumpkin stems
Andrew,I totally thought you meant Ava
Andrew,lololol
Andrew,Yeah me too
Andrew,I was pretty sure you meant ava
Andrew,did ava name herself after the dog or the dog after ava?
Andrew,Ava named her online alias after the dog

Andrew,"Indeed, it is a game"
Andrew,"I'm still cracking up that I told kameron I was halfway through the final boss at around 830, which was 100% true, and the game wasn't actually over until 11"
Andrew,game's ending was longer than most movies
Andrew,and it made me feel a lot of things
Andrew,That's like the ending of Pokemon sun and moon
Andrew,most of them good
Andrew,I hate it when you think you are gonna beat a game
Andrew,Then the ending takes a million hours
Andrew,And you end up staying up all night
Andrew,god the ending was so good though
Andrew,@undertale
Andrew,I wouldn't have cut any of it out
Andrew,It's like 30+ minutes of unskipable cutscenes
Andrew,this was about two hours
Andrew,two glorious hours
Andrew,What game is it sylki?
Andrew,Nice
Andrew,scroll up a wee bit
Andrew,you'll see
Andrew,Persona 5 you drunk
Andrew,Sorry
Andrew,I was thinking about rough completion times for most rpgs
Andrew,and it's like
Andrew,pokemon: 20-30 hours
Andrew,chrono trigger: 30-35
Andrew,chrono cross: 50ish
Andrew,@bois I'm becoming a PI today. Get to go investigate a sketchy corp and acquire police reports and records from the capitol of my state
Andrew,xenobladeX: 65
Andrew,persona 3: 75
Andrew,@wolfstein 20
Andrew,xenoblade: 80
Andrew,"persona 5, according to my game file, 94 hours"
Andrew,that is insane
Andrew,Those are looking like my CSGO hours
Andrew,Except mine are like +60
Andrew,So
Andrew,Not that close actually
Andrew,"at least on steam, the only games I've played more than 94 hours are tf2, csgo, and rivals"
Andrew,"seriously though, incredible game"
Andrew,and all I want to do is start again
Andrew,try and get all the stuff I missed
Andrew,WHOS HYPED FOR NEW WOLFENSTEIN
Andrew,I didn't play the first one
Andrew,there's a whole bunch
Andrew,Oh
Andrew,I've played none of them
Andrew,I have also played none of them
Andrew,"one of my favourite things about studying is coming up with really, really shitty acronyms for things, only for them to actually be useful if only because I'm amused by how terrible they are"
Andrew,I sometimes make acronyms too
Andrew,"current highlights are SDVE (pronounced like ""Steve""), and SCURP (which is just fun to say)"
Andrew,bonus points to myself for figuring out the Steve thing cause the acronym has to be in that order
Andrew,nice
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether @Cs:go games?

Andrew,why am I like this
Andrew,yur dumb
Andrew,"it's like, five or six hours in a nearly hundred hour game is not all that long, and when's the next time I'm gonna have the opportunity to a) choose first and last name for a characters, and b) have the name 'Locke' be thematically appropriate?"
Andrew,"I'm not gonna do it, cause those five or six wasted hours aren't worth the shitty joke"
Andrew,I'll save it for if I ever run a rogue in D&D
Andrew,"lol ""Guys, the audio seems delayed because light travels faster than sound. The stream is coming from Canada so the difference in speed is magnified."""

Andrew,that was sick
Andrew,and n0ne's playing crazy too
Andrew,but he's against armada so he's still losing
Andrew,he's moving tho
Andrew,that was depressing
Andrew,n0ne's offense was incredible
Andrew,but armada's defense was even better
Andrew,"like n0ne was moving insanely fast and getting really neat followups but anything that wasn't 100% guarunteed just wasn't hitting, ever"
Andrew,"welp kage's getting m2k, rip canada"

Andrew,
Andrew,essential if youère gonna be in this server

Andrew,did he play gay sheiks before?
Andrew,kirbykaze then android
Andrew,"3-1, 3-1"
Andrew,but now he's got m2k
Andrew,who is a very different beast
Andrew,Did you not get his joke?
Andrew,prolly ignored cause it was a dumb joke
Andrew,oh lol
Andrew,that took me a few seconds
Andrew,my god they're both nuts
Andrew,that was way closer than I was expecting
Andrew,"and then n0ne just kinda goes ""oh shit it's game five last stock, better turn up"""
Andrew,honestly kage did better than I expected
Andrew,lolol they're singing him happy birthday
Andrew,"well top 4 is gonna be hype : armada, leffen, m2k, n0ne"
Andrew,"lolol street fighter is doing crews, the grand finals is Team Japan 2 vs Team Japan 3"
Andrew,"street fighter crews seem weird cause nothing carries over between matches, so it's entirely plausible to just send out your best player first and have them sweep the whole other crew"
Andrew,rip n0ne
Andrew,that poof kill was so sad
Andrew,I'm personally glad to see m2k re-mastering his vs falcon game
Andrew,"cause n0ne kept it even all the way till that, and was outplaying him after it, but he died at like 40% and he wasn't playing well enough to bring it all the way back"
Andrew,I honestly don't feel like m2k was playing that particularly well
Andrew,yo m2k with the quick classic - weak upsmash to tipper fsmash
Andrew,Good to see the player I always copy copying me for once
Andrew,yo that was awesome
Andrew,M2K catches the close range stitch and kills armada with it
Andrew,YESSSSSS
Andrew,4th time
Andrew,that was quite the pop off
Andrew,first time ever in a game 5
Andrew,he just vanished from the playercam for a good 5-10 seconds
Andrew,I missed the stitch catch tho and that makes me sad
Andrew,i dont think that there is any doubt now that hbox > armada
Andrew,are leffen and plup gonna surpass the other 3 gods tho?
Andrew,m2k pogchamp
Andrew,m2k's feeling himself
Andrew,hopefully he can keep it up for both sets
Andrew,I think if he wins it would be his biggest win of all time
Andrew,WHAT
Andrew,THESE TECS
Andrew,Repeat of the 6-0 meme?
Andrew,OH MY GAWSH
Andrew,HES CRAZY
Andrew,He is definitely above plup this year if he wins
Andrew,who?
Andrew,m2k
Andrew,leffen or m2k
Andrew,possibly also leffen
Andrew,"i mean, plup beat leffen like 4 times"
Andrew,h2h doesn't really matter as much in melee
Andrew,chu is up 4-1 vs m2k but no one says he should outrank him
Andrew,this is true
Andrew,good god m2k's going ham
Andrew,60-40 XD
Andrew,NA crowd
Andrew,imo its 50-50
Andrew,i know the crowd is chanting 60-40
Andrew,it's weirdly stage dependant tho
Andrew,yeah I heard
Andrew,FD it's like 65-35 for marth
Andrew,dream land 60-40 fox
Andrew,"it seems like except for hbox, the top 6 is really a toss up right now"
Andrew,m2k's going haaaaaaam
Andrew,calm down m2k
Andrew,Lets go 6-0
Andrew,DAT UPSMASH THO

Andrew,well
Andrew,politcally conservative yes
Andrew,You know what I meant
Andrew,yeah was clarifying
Andrew,Welcome back
Andrew,this was the girl who seemed kinda sketchy about the whole relationships thing?
Andrew,she just kinda ignored me all the time
Andrew,after I asked her out
Andrew,"(on an unrelated note, someone in the crowd for sfv at canada cup has a massive sign that just says 'SORRY')"
Andrew,yeah that seems like a good call
Andrew,she didn't ignore me when I said we were done though
Andrew,and she sent a snap of her drinking with some dude
Andrew,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Andrew,lol
Andrew,Don't respond
Andrew,FeelsBadMan
Andrew,No
Andrew,"I think that's supposed to be a ""I don't need you"" kinda thing"
Andrew,That's what your supposed to feel
Andrew,which is a massive dick move
Andrew,but seeing as you kinda already figured she didn't give much of a fuck about you
Andrew,hopefully it's not as bad
Andrew,I know I made the right choice and had good reasons but I still feel bad
Andrew,"not for her, just bad in general"
Andrew,I know that feel
Andrew,relationships are weird
Andrew,^
Andrew,akwardly sits with absolutely nothing to add
Andrew,it's honestly made me kinda hesitant to try em out again
Andrew,should probably try to get over that
Andrew,"also max, you're at college give it a shot"
Andrew,There is no one good
Andrew,fair
Andrew,I feel that
Andrew,but you should at least try to make some friends
Andrew,No one good... yet
Andrew,there prolly is
Andrew,you just always find the bad ones first
Andrew,that's the best way to find people imo
Andrew,damn apparently people sponsored by echo fox won all the smash events at canada cup

Andrew,"On a rainy morning in Tokyo, Takao Akizuki, an aspiring shoemaker, decides to skip class to sketch designs in a beautiful garden. This is where he meets Yukari Yukino, a beautiful yet mysterious woman, for the very first time. Offering to make her new shoes, Takao continues to meet with Yukari throughout the rainy season, and without even realizing it, the two are able to alleviate the worries hidden in their hearts just by being with each other. However, their personal struggles have not disappeared completely, and as the end of the rainy season approaches, their relationship will be put to the test. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Andrew,"To the outside world, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are the perfect couple. But in reality, they just share the same secret pain: they are both in love with other people they cannot be with. Hanabi has loved her childhood friend and neighbor Narumi Kanai for as long as she can remember, so she is elated to discover that he is her new homeroom teacher. However, Narumi is soon noticed by the music teacher, Akane Minagawa, and a relationship begins to blossom between them, much to Hanabi's dismay. Mugi was tutored by Akane in middle school, and has been in love with her since then. Through a chance meeting in the hallway, he encounters Hanabi. As these two lonely souls spend more time together, they decide to use each other as a substitute for the one they truly love, sharing physical intimacy with one another in order to stave off their loneliness.

Andrew,"Haruhi Fujioka is a bright scholarship candidate with no rank or title to speak of—a rare species at Ouran High School, an elite academy for students of high pedigree. When she opens the door to Music Room #3 hoping to find a quiet place to study, Haruhi unexpectedly stumbles upon the Host Club. Led by the princely Tamaki, the club—whose other members include the ""Shadow King"" Kyouya, the mischievous Hitachiin twins, and the childlike Haninozuka ""Honey"" and his strong protector Mori—is where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls in the academy. In a frantic attempt to remove herself from the hosts, Haruhi ends up breaking a vase worth eight million yen and is forced into becoming the eccentric group's general errand boy to repay her enormous debt. However, thanks to her convincingly masculine appearance, her naturally genial disposition toward girls, and fascinating commoner status, she is soon promoted to full-time male host and plunged headlong into a glitzy whirlwind of elaborate cosplays, rich food, and exciting shenanigans that only the immensely wealthy Ouran Host Club can pull off.

Andrew,Great Teacher Onizuka
Andrew,"Onizuka is a reformed biker gang leader who has his sights set on an honorable new ambition: to become the world's greatest teacher... for the purpose of meeting sexy high school girls. Okay, so he's mostly reformed. However, strict administrators and a class of ruthless delinquents stand between Onizuka and his goal and they will use any means, however illegal or low, to drive the new teacher away. Perfect, because Onizuka's methods won't be found in any teaching manual; he cares about the difference between legal and illegal activities about as much as he cares for the age difference between himself and a high school girl. So get ready for math that doesn't add up, language you'd be slapped for using, and biology that would make a grown man blush... unless of course, you're the Great Teacher Onizuka.

Andrew,um
Andrew,should we be worried?
Andrew,he got in car crash
Andrew,"I got that part, was mostly worried that there might be something in the aftermath"
Andrew,but I guess he meant more in the general case of if he dies cause unforseen circumstances
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,not sudoku
Andrew,I'm very aware right now. Of how fragile life is
Andrew,@Sak von Sak have you been in a car crasherino?
Andrew,I got hit by a bus while on my bike once
Andrew,How did you not die.exe?
Andrew,"and I distinctly remember falling towards the side/wheels, and thinking ""SHIT""  and then ""Come on man, if you die here, is that really the last thing you want to think?"""
Andrew,Then what :0
Andrew,and then some 30-120 second gap in my memory
Andrew,next thing I remember is propped up against a building on the side of the road with all the people I was with gathered in a terrified semi-circle around me
Andrew,and being sooooo deep in shock
Andrew,We're you injured?
Andrew,"I survived by not getting hit on, I swerved, my back wheel popped up and I spun into the side then fell off, then.... something"
Andrew,"nothing serious, my knees have been even more screwey ever since"
Andrew,"he ended up running over my bike, thought he'd run me over and was honestly the most relieved person in the whole event"
Andrew,I still have the decimated bike seat
Andrew,How long ago was this

Andrew,pubg?
Andrew,Leffen got possibly the hardest bracket possible
Andrew,yeah thats what the casters just said xd
Andrew,Mango>Plup>Armada>Hbox
Andrew,"bruh if leffen was on the other side of the bracket, then this would be ez tourney 4 plup"
Andrew,now its ez tourney for hbox
Andrew,unless big leff goes ham
Andrew,but i dont think that plup can win the tourney anymore
Andrew,Since leffen won't kill hbox for him?
Andrew,ye
Andrew,unless mango beats hbox in winners and big leff beats him in losers
Andrew,but that prolly wont happen
Andrew,ez 4 the box
Andrew,"full predictions: hbox 3-0 SFAT, Mango 3-1 Axe, Armada 3-2 wizzy, plup 3-2 leff, hbox 3-1 mango, plup 3-2 armada, hbox 3-0 plup"
Andrew,I think armada wizzy will be a 3-0
Andrew,yeah you're prolly right
Andrew,hbox 4-stock pogchamp
Andrew,so much for the 3-0
Andrew,3-2 ecksdee
Andrew,but my preds are already wrong
Andrew,i thought axe's yung link would beat mango's mario
Andrew,but it didnt
Andrew,you still have gotten set winners correct
Andrew,^
Andrew,lets go wizy
Andrew,can he do it
Andrew,hes going ham
Andrew,but i have to root against him
Andrew,I don't think plup beating armada was the streak being broken because plup was top 6 at then time
Andrew,If wizy wins its truely over
Andrew,Why do you need to root against wizy?
Andrew,for da predictions
Andrew,your predictions are not worth the hype of armada losing to a non top 6
Andrew,maybe 3-0 at that
Andrew,yeah but upsets are only interesting in the short term
Andrew,I think if the armada slump continues he will retire
Andrew,look at armada's face
Andrew,he looks depressed
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,I think he is actually gonna cry
Andrew,CHOKE
Andrew,armada is back
Andrew,rip the dream
Andrew,NOOOOOOOOOOO
Andrew,that ending
Andrew,wizzy beat himself that set
Andrew,alright time for the classic salty leff v plup

Andrew,aw
Andrew,this match is lit
Andrew,real lit
Andrew,the plup samus coming out?
Andrew,well rip
Andrew,I'm going to be studying that game later
Andrew,honestly it was a pretty questionable choice
Andrew,the commentators weren't lying when they said it's her worst stage in the matchup
Andrew,I know
Andrew,FD is my ban
Andrew,lets go leffen

Andrew,cause our basement is just concrete and we never go down there expect to do laundry
Andrew,and if I left it on the floor they'd have to clean it again and I'm not that heartless
Andrew,"one time at my school I saw someone walk into the laundry room, take their load out of the washer, then found a dryer with the most amount of time on it. they just took out someone elses laundy and tossed it on the floor"
Andrew,so they got a free dryer

Andrew,Is this IRL or on a stream?
Andrew,irl
Andrew,some of the worst melee you've ever seen
Andrew,but hype as shit
Andrew,I got the fastest semi-legit zero to death of my life
Andrew,"start of match, got drill shined, tried to cc downsmash but his shine pushed me off stage so it got treated as buffered dair, but he messed up his waveshine and also went off stage, right into my dair and died from it"
Andrew,also no one has any ability to maintain reasonable composure
Andrew,a guy got in my head by talking about the midterm we both did earlier in the day
Andrew,"""Yo what architecture style did you use? you'd better of used pipe & filter or you probably failed.""
""I didn't use pipe and filter""
""Damn son you are FUUUUUUCKED"""
Andrew,missing one question means you fail?
Andrew,100 mark test
Andrew,66 mark question
Andrew,I stand by my choice of style tho
Andrew,is this the one where failing means you fail the course?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,but I'm pretty sure implicit invocation will work jsut fine
Andrew,so missing that one question will cost you the course
Andrew,hypothetically
Andrew,but there's a lot of bits
Andrew,getting the wrong style won't make me fail
Andrew,also I'm pretty sure my style is just as valid
Andrew,if you care for a slightly more coherant answer ask me tomorrow
Andrew,okay

Andrew,nah
Andrew,that is not optimal
Andrew,"I personally believe that the way I behave as a person makes be the best possible fit for lawful good, although I think my dad could fit it too, we just didn't put him on the chart because he isn't really a part of this server."

Andrew,you can buy that on steam
Andrew,and I know we have the disc somewhere I just can't find it and I'm lazy
Andrew,yeah I can
Andrew,or he could not
Andrew,but I already own the game
Andrew,and save money on a game his dad owns
Andrew,then go look for it
Andrew,mighta got lost when we moved a couple years ago
Andrew,lol rip
Andrew,but if I already purchased the game once
Andrew,is it wrong for me to download it somewhere else
Andrew,I mean I would probably buy it since its really cheap but in this case I say do what you want
Andrew,its $10
Andrew,thats nothing
Andrew,rich boi
Andrew,yeah it is
Andrew,$ 10 bucks
Andrew,thats like a third tank of gas
Andrew,I mean I'm not buying it again  just asking what you though
Andrew,*1/4 a tank
Andrew,not for meeeee
Andrew,i fill up for 30
Andrew,then you have a smaller tank
Andrew,ye
Andrew,but I can go a week+
Andrew,so its guchi
Andrew,"builds a new gaming pc to play good looking games, spends hours on a game from 2005"
Andrew,is retarded
Andrew,boys lets play some gaymes
Andrew,isn't a mooch ;)
Andrew,Pirates is a good game
Andrew,
Andrew,ooh but what do I name myself tho
Andrew,also English ftw
Andrew,My name will be Carl Okson
Andrew,KArl
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,yeah?
Andrew,I motion for an amendment of the allignment chart
Andrew,"I say bitmin should be chaotic evil, and I should be neutral evil"
Andrew,I suggested that but Ava insisted it stay how it is
Andrew,Facsism is worse than ironically disrespecting whamen
Andrew,"also he says ""kind of"" a facist"
Andrew,I DID NOT
Andrew,also its just a joke so it doesn't really matter
Andrew,I'll change yours if you can come up with something better that still fits chaotic neutral
Andrew,
Andrew,Love this game
Andrew,"How dare you attack English ships! For whatever reason, when I played that game I never attacked the English (I was English myself)."
Andrew,I don't
Andrew,oh is that your fleet?
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,rip
Andrew,Glory to the crown
Andrew,get to a port
Andrew,Nah I had to divide the plunder
Andrew,Am rebuolding
Andrew,I'm already an English duke
Andrew,nice
Andrew,difficulty?
Andrew,The third one up I think? I've been advancing each time I divide plunder
Andrew,"If faschism were the measure for making someone ""evil"", which I don't think it is (but thats sorta besides the point), wouldent that be characterised closer to lawful ""evil"" rather than chaotic ""evil"" seeing as it usually leads to rules set in place that are very strict and follow a more lawful form of lifestyle or government(regardless of whether its better or not) rather than chaotic ?"
Andrew,I agree with this reasoning
Andrew,well since I'm lawful with the real law I get lawful evil
Andrew,"lawful evil just means you follow a set of guidelines, not necessarily the law"
Andrew,"a mass murderer who only kills blond men under 5'3"" is lawful evil"
Andrew,a law-abiding asshole who's just generally a dick to everyone would not be lawful evil (probably neutral evil)
Andrew,idk how much i agree with that
Andrew,"having a standard for who you murder isnt exactly ""lawful"""
Andrew,"among the two of us, I'm the one who's actually played D&D"
Andrew,and has had the alignments explained in a lot of detail
Andrew,"oh, does it?"
Andrew,did not kn o w
Andrew,well its too late and its a meme anyway
Andrew,"lawful normally aligns with the law (particularly lawful good), but that's mainly due to the law being a pre-existing set of moral rules"
Andrew,"chaotic generally is following your instincts for good/evil, not having a 'code' that you follow, and placing more value on an individual's choice"
Andrew,the whole lawful vs chaotic thing can also be framed in terms of order vs freedom
Andrew,
Andrew,Facism as a social system has only brought suffering and death to the masses
Andrew,"things I learned today: there is a toronto melee player whose tag is 'DACDACBRUCE', a tag that makes even less sense when you realize that his actual name is jonathan"
Andrew,Guys it's cornpop
Andrew,ew

Andrew,"and these mongs are like ""yeah that do"" like shit thought we were playing hte same class forgot blizzard made it so everyones class is different depending on whos playing it"

Andrew,like these fucking monkeys
Andrew,go play ret pally get off feral im surprised you even have the brain power to operate this spec

Andrew,Stat whore
Andrew,:p

Andrew,"Who we make a gift box for, for a set amount of money"
Andrew,Then mail it off in time for Christmas

Andrew,Salt has infused itself with my dna
Andrew,
Andrew,Fuck me 
Andrew,That's your chance
Andrew,slide into those DMs
Andrew,No
Andrew,Is this your ex or something?
Andrew,no
Andrew,here's the story
Andrew,this chick on halloween was dared to kiss me during truth or dare
Andrew,and she did and she was like apologizing a bunch about it bein awkward
Andrew,and I was the one who was driving her home and so like in my car she was still talking about it XD and I said well oh we'll have to try it again sometime then
Andrew,so after that we talk a lot over snapchat and hang out at school and stuff
Andrew,and then 2 fridays ago we hung out outside of school and before I took her home we kinda just looked at each other and made out
Andrew,so that was chill everything was good
Andrew,after that we talked about where we were at and I said I wanted to go out with her but she said she wasn't ready for a relationship yet but that she wanted to date me
Andrew,so i was like chill I can wait
Andrew,fast forward to this last friday
Andrew,was 10/10 stoned with trap and another friend
Andrew,I was talking with her and sent a snap that said I really like you or something like that
Andrew,and she responds with a long ass snap about how she isn't ready for a relationship and that she couldn't ever see us being more than friends
Andrew,and then today she posted that
Andrew,"also, saturday she went back to snapping me like we never even had the conversation"
Andrew,idk lifes a bitch
Andrew,"no, she is xd"
Andrew,Women are weird sometimes my dude
Andrew,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Andrew,Yo
Andrew,hit her up
Andrew,be like
Andrew,what's the deal
Andrew,??
Andrew,see if I do that she's gonna be all pissy and be like oh I thought you were more mature than that
Andrew,I'm probably gonna end up doing that tho
Andrew,haha true
Andrew,we'll see how high I get
Andrew,woah
Andrew,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Andrew,"Yo just man up, do it without the green"
Andrew,I'm not sure if I want to lose the friendship tho
Andrew,Idk man
Andrew,Low-key wanna comment in her post like then just go get a boyfriend there are lots of guys it there right?
Andrew,@The Rona is that roast good enough?
Andrew,It's not terrible
Andrew,Make sure that you have every word spelt correctly though if you do post that
Andrew,
Andrew,I feel like it's just passive aggressive enough to get away with
Andrew,I'm bouta fuck myself over prolly but it's finr
Andrew,Yeah who cares
Andrew,The only reason that the friendship exists in the first place is because of romantic interest
Andrew,"Without that, there's not really a point is there?"
Andrew,I guess the eventual hopes of her liking me again is the main motive
Andrew,"That's probably the hardest part, not gonna lie"
Andrew,I'ma comment it
Andrew,Whatever happens happens
Andrew,I say go for it
Andrew,She could either see it as funny and hit you up or see you as a dick
Andrew,So
Andrew,It's done
Andrew,It's whatever
Andrew,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Andrew,Life goes on
Andrew,haha
Andrew,C'est la vie
Andrew,Lmao the response is already in 
Andrew,No way
Andrew,"""I don't appreciate your salty ass comment"""
Andrew,I haven't opened it yet but that's what it says
Andrew,Did she dm that to you?
Andrew,Yeah over snap
Andrew,How do you know what it says??
Andrew,Gonna bring up not ready for a relationship probably
Andrew,If you don't slide it all the way you can read the right most text
Andrew,I see
Andrew,"It would have been kinda funny if you commented ""Sorry, I'm not ready for a relationship"" "
Andrew,Yours was better though
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,Damn she's gonna block me from her sinsta
Andrew,Rip
Andrew,Oh well
Andrew,At least my music is lit
Andrew,people who block over stupid things are honestly the worst
Andrew,But she is the best
Andrew,;~;
Andrew,Okay but she probably isn't the best but for some reason I think she is and I feel like doing dumb shit like commenting will make her not be my friend anymore
Andrew,And maybe I will stop being obsessed with her if I have a reason to be angry at her
Andrew,Jed
Andrew,This is what dating Hatcher felt like. Don't get cucked buddy. She may seem like the best thing on Earth right now. But she's being a huge jerk. Stand up for yourself and don't take shit from anyone
Andrew,"Yeah, if she acts this petty over one little comment, she ain't worth your time"
Andrew,Please help save net neutrality https://www.battleforthenet.com

Andrew,Yo the punisher is lit
Andrew,Yee
Andrew,I'm on episode 7
Andrew,"While doing research for an essay I'm writing, I came across an idea which is so simple yet I believe could revolutionize the way our government works and I had to share it. What if we made all political donations fully anonymous. If you want to see the full article, PM me with your email addess and I'll send it to you."
Andrew,Wow that sounds like a great idea
Andrew,why can't you just link the article
Andrew,@foreinggovernmentswhowoulddonatebillionstofundnationalpolicythrouhgcandtidatestheyliked
Andrew,its on a scholarly database which is restricted
Andrew,"basic reasoning behind why that doesn't work is the 'anonymous' bit - the politician just sees the money, not who its from or any messages"
Andrew,Can you give me the rundown of how this would affect the government?
Andrew,and anyone could claim to have been the donator and there's no real way to prove who it actually was
Andrew,helps stop people from giving politicians monetary incentive to support or oppose legislature
Andrew,"don't feel like rewriting the article or debating it rn, just PM me your email if you want it"
Andrew,"Send me the article max and I will see if I agree with this.. It sounds like an interesting notion, although my natural reaction is to oppose this."
Andrew,I will read it tomorrow
Andrew,I NEED YOUR EMAIL FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME
Andrew,You have my email dork from google docs
Andrew,On all the stuff we have collaborated on
Andrew,andrewjp42@gmail.com
Andrew,Like atlanta docs last year
Andrew,also is atlanta 2.0 still on?
Andrew,it would be DC
Andrew,when?
Andrew,summer 2018
Andrew,no more detail currently
Andrew,@Mr. Airplanes house?
Andrew,thats the goal
Andrew,okay
Andrew,keep me informed
Andrew,I need to procure certain amounts of funds into my savings account
Andrew,yeah cause I need to start looking at costs now
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane
Andrew,make us some waffles
Andrew,please
Andrew,❤
Andrew,pancakes are better
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane make us pancakes instead
Andrew,proper waffles are better imo
Andrew,FALSE
Andrew,they hold toppings way better
Andrew,I'm more into crepes
Andrew,#teampancake
Andrew,waffles are superior
Andrew,crepes are pretty damn good
Andrew,@Sak von Sak dont let them decieve you
Andrew,#team crepes
Andrew,waffles are good but theres nothing better than a big fluffy sweet pancake
Andrew,but in the waffles vs pancakes debate waffles are clearly superior
Andrew,n0
Andrew,yes
Andrew,waffles >= crepes > pancakes
Andrew,"but like,,"
Andrew,you cant cook things into waffles
Andrew,"@Trapezoider We have not had a proper conversation on meaningful topics in a long time, you should join up discord for games/discussion more often."
Andrew,yeah you totally can
Andrew,itll be all burnt n gross
Andrew,http://www.strawpoll.me/14455790
Andrew,Which is better?
Andrew,Vote Now! [Waffles] [Pancakes]
Andrew,never happened to me
Andrew,
Andrew,I prefer to eat lunch food anyways
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,pancakes have superior texture and flavor
Andrew,I concur
Andrew,not a fan of breakfast food
Andrew,false
Andrew,PICK ONE THO MAX
Andrew,flavour? they're like 99% the exact same ingredients
Andrew,Can we objecitvely prove which is better?
Andrew,pancakes
Andrew,OH SHIT FAMILY BETRAYAL
Andrew,if we are talking highest quality waffles vs. highest quality pancakes waffles take it
Andrew,i mean I guess but theres something about waffles thats kinda off putting
Andrew,me and ava both chose pancakes
Andrew,like theres a flavor there thats just  ? ? ?
Andrew,eh
Andrew,oh whoops
Andrew,how do i describe it
Andrew,"the only thing offputting about waffles is how much better they are than pancakes, given that they're the exact same thing cooked in a slightly different manner"
Andrew,DIE
Andrew,FALSE
Andrew,they're like weirdly more bitter
Andrew,nah
Andrew,dude
Andrew,maybe because theyre cooked more harshly
Andrew,then you're just screwing up your pancake making
Andrew,like who even cares to debate something as meaningless as this
Andrew,like everyone in this discord
Andrew,wait how? I want my pancakes to be sweeter
Andrew,waffles with strawberry compote is the best way to wake up on a saturday
Andrew,also I take my food very seriously
Andrew,this is serious business!!
Andrew,I have trash taste in food so I just eat what I like and keep to myself
Andrew,"waffles with strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream, and maple syrup (like actual maple syrup, not whatever weird shenanagins like corn syrup that you guys have in the states) is honestly unbelievably good"
Andrew,all that with pancakes instead of waffles is better imo
Andrew,I guess we'll have to agree to disagree
Andrew,naw cause with pancakes all the syrup and stuff doesn't stay on
Andrew,I am a fan of fruit syrups personally
Andrew,I mean don't get me wrong maple syrup is still hella good
Andrew,pancakes soak up syrup better
Andrew,"fruit syrup's alright, but it's not as good as actual maple syrup"
Andrew,you can mix 'em and get some good combinations tho
Andrew,truth
Andrew,waffles soaked in syrup are a weird combo of hard and squishy
Andrew,pancakes are soft and nice
Andrew,
Andrew,why is that a video XD
Andrew,why did you make me download that
Andrew,eat my waffles filled bootyhole
Andrew,@HalfCentaur
Andrew,@Trapezoider plane tickets are 358 round trip to dc
Andrew,kk
Andrew,can u afford
Andrew,that will go down after holidays?
Andrew,I mean
Andrew,probably not
Andrew,plane ticket prices can vary greatly over time so be sure to keep checking
Andrew,they might be jacking up all prices since its around holidays
Andrew,also tristan
Andrew,can prolly hook us up with good deals
Andrew,I looked at dates in the summer tho
Andrew,if you book farther in advance itll be cheaper I think
Andrew,they can't do that right now though since we don't know when it'll be
Andrew,"His mother is a flight attendant, and is allegedly able to secure cheap flights regularly"
Andrew,yeah

Andrew,It all makes sense
Andrew,never has a steam game taken so long to allocate disk space
Andrew,Kameron can afford a bunch of couches because he sells drugs
Andrew,"Oh no, I've been found out"
Andrew,Gotta move to South America now
Andrew,actually I think you've mixed up cause and effect - he has to afford all the couches to store his drugs
Andrew,Check out your supply?
Andrew,"Kameron, take me with you"
Andrew,Going to Columbia?
Andrew,yo why the fuck did it have to allocate 50 gigs if the game is actually only 26.6gb?

Andrew,is fusion going to play to make it 5?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,@Trapezoider csgo with us?
Andrew,@The Rona where you at
Andrew,welp
Andrew,my thermostat is broken again
Andrew,rip
Andrew,sad
Andrew,fucking thing lasted like two weeks
Andrew,warranty?
Andrew,"leading me to assume that it's either a) a faulty model in general, or b) something wacky's going on with the electricity through that particular bit that's causing the thermostat to keep fucking up"
Andrew,it's all handled and paid for by my landlord
Andrew,cause the lease more or less legally compels him to give us a functioning house
Andrew,"on an unrelated note, I think I might have gotten weirdly good at sm4sh falcon"
Andrew,that or the fact that me and the guy I was playing had a combined seven hours of sleep made everything dumb work
Andrew,@max
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,yeah?
Andrew,Smash?
Andrew,@Sak von Sak you mean your sleep + his sleep was 7 hours?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,yup
Andrew,I had three hours he had four
Andrew,K finishing one more run through of moonlight sonata third movement then running upstairs
Andrew,3.5 mins
Andrew,when is your crew battle thing sylki?
Andrew,over
Andrew,we didn't get anything on stream
Andrew,how did it go?
Andrew,which I'm super grateful for because I played like a rusty trash can
Andrew,we went 0-2
Andrew,but we still go the next round cause top 4 teams make it out and there were only 4 teams
Andrew,so I've got time to remember how to play the game
Andrew,so hopefully next time I don't lose six stocks and only take three
Andrew,double elimination crews are weird
Andrew,especially cause there was a grand finals reset
Andrew,so it was like an hour and a half long
Andrew,"melee crews were hype tho, unfortunately we didn't have a crew cause we couldn't get enough interest "
Andrew,but I got to watch one crew's anchor take 12 stocks (that I saw) and lose the battle by one stock
Andrew,Good luck next round!
Andrew,our second match was kinda funny cause we lost by one stock and every single member of our crew is blaming themselves for not getting one more stock
Andrew,"""I had a good read on him but I let him get too much of a lead early on""
""I misinput a kill throw and dropped a stock cause of it and then my next game forgot how to fight ryu until I was already on last stock at death percent""
""I went too deep when I was making a comeback and could have taken that last stock""
""I SD'd at under 50% when the other guy was last stock at 130%""
""I choked under the last stock pressure, the full knees weak arms heavy mom's spaghetti experience"""
Andrew,which one is you?
Andrew,the second
Andrew,"although in afterthough I actually messed up the order, second and third should be swapped"
Andrew,my back throw that was supposed to be upthrow was on the last stock of the almost comeback

Andrew,"When an Emishi village is attacked by a fierce demon boar, the young prince Ashitaka puts his life at stake to defend his tribe. With its dying breath, the beast curses the prince's arm, granting him demonic powers while gradually siphoning his life away. Instructed by the village elders to travel westward for a cure, Ashitaka arrives at Tatara, the Iron Town, where he finds himself embroiled in a fierce conflict: Lady Eboshi of Tatara, promoting constant deforestation, stands against Princess San and the sacred spirits of the forest, who are furious at the destruction brought by the humans. As the opposing forces of nature and mankind begin to clash in a desperate struggle for survival, Ashitaka attempts to seek harmony between the two, all the while battling the latent demon inside of him. Princess Mononoke is a tale depicting the connection of technology and nature, while showing the path to harmony that could be achieved by mutual acceptance. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Andrew,oh my b @Mr. Airplane thought you were trap
Andrew,Why does who it is matter?
Andrew,cause trap told his mom
Andrew,Did you get in trouble?
Andrew,did I get in fucking trouble
Andrew,lmao
Andrew,is that a question
Andrew,"Yo, that's actually dick"
Andrew,I'm going to counselling now no phone no car
Andrew,prolly transfering schools
Andrew,rip dc?
Andrew,and on top of that my parents told my little brothers that I was making bad choices and my brother asked if I was gonna kill him
Andrew,idk
Andrew,we'll see if I'm even around then
Andrew,don't kill yourself
Andrew,you should become a therapist max
Andrew,"I'm to brutally honest for that, I would be a much better life coach."
Andrew,WHOOSH
Andrew,ya know what that is
Andrew,@Trapezoider what the fuck man
Andrew,thats the sound the joke makes as it goes right over your head
Andrew,wait hold up @The Chief Apple what happened dude
Andrew,parents found my shit
Andrew,did trap intentionally get you in trouble?
Andrew,idk all I know is he told his mom that he smoked with me
Andrew,snap dude
Andrew,and that I peer pressured him  into it
Andrew,atleast thats what I heard
Andrew,so whats happening with your parents then?
Andrew,idk man
Andrew,no car
Andrew,phone is being watched
Andrew,counseling
Andrew,and they might try to make me quit my job
Andrew,geez
Andrew,yeet
Andrew,love my family
Andrew,that sucks dude
Andrew,my brother asking if I was gonna kill him is the worst part
Andrew,like fuck
Andrew,I'ma take a long walk tonight and see where I'm at
Andrew,hopefully everything works out ok my dude
Andrew,we'll see
Andrew,oh yeah
Andrew,I am probably getting transferred back to my old school at some point too
Andrew,they almost called the police instead of talking to me about it too
Andrew,well at least they didn't do that
Andrew,they threatened that if I don't do exactly what they say they still will get police involved
Andrew,so I have that hanging over me
Andrew,which is nice
Andrew,That's honestly stupid
Andrew,Not gonna lie
Andrew,I dont understand how parents can say something like that
Andrew,you right
Andrew,I mean you're their kid
Andrew,so hey anyone have an extra bed 
Andrew,do they not realize how that makes somebody feel?
Andrew,but like real shit even ignoring the fact that you're their son who the fuck calls the police on someone for smoking weed
Andrew,true
Andrew,ESPECIALLY if they're your kid tho
Andrew,well obv
Andrew,"just got caught up on this, seems pretty dumb"
Andrew,I mean I knew the risk
Andrew,but still
Andrew,they're still overreacting
Andrew,it seems like they're handling this poorly
Andrew,^understatement of the day^
Andrew,what is the right way to handle something like this then?
Andrew,oh shit man you smoke weed
Andrew,like dont
Andrew,^
Andrew,"some things they did wasn't unreasonable, but transferring schools is hella dumb"
Andrew,give an ultimatum before going all in on the reform
Andrew,"I mean, yeah octo's parents are going super far but I don't think just saying ""don't do that"" is going to change anything"
Andrew,"you don't decide someone's making bad life decisions, don't force them into worse places"
Andrew,help them get somewhere better
Andrew,well i mean its not like hes making terrible life choices that will ruin his future forever
Andrew,"like ""if you CONTINUE to do this then we'll make you move schools"""
Andrew,smoking weed is pretty lax
Andrew,was talking from his parents' perspective
Andrew,yeah but it is illegal at his age so its not a great idea
Andrew,I mean there is no ultimatum
Andrew,its all of the above
Andrew,"no car, quit your job, go to counseling, possibly switch schools"
Andrew,the parts of that that are at least partially reasonable - counselling
Andrew,not really anything else
Andrew,that quit your job part like what is that supposed to accomplish
Andrew,unless it's their car that they're letting you use
Andrew,but not any counseling
Andrew,Christian counseling
Andrew,I think it's so he doesn't have money to buy weed -_-
Andrew,oh lord jesus
Andrew,save that for the christian counseling jed
Andrew,but like... a major part of traditional rehabilitation for stuff like this is to get a job so you become a productive person
Andrew,^^^^^^^^^
Andrew,but thats the thing
Andrew,I smoke
Andrew,but I am also a very productive highschooler
Andrew,I have good grades
Andrew,and a job
Andrew,"""hey you seem like a really good kid, lets change that so that you stop smoking"""
Andrew,yup
Andrew,like literally taking away everything I've worked to get my life in a decent place
Andrew,gone
Andrew,my advice would be to wait till they've cooled off a bit and then talk to them about it in this context
Andrew,there is no talking to them
Andrew,my parents are close minded retards
Andrew,you'll probably have to take some other punishment but if you can keep the stuff that makes your life better it's worth it
Andrew,my life was kinda already shitty before this
Andrew,now there isn't gonna be really anything
Andrew,fuck
Andrew,I dunno what to say man
Andrew,
Andrew,how would switching your school even help the issue?
Andrew,"if they do force you into counselling talk to your counsellor about this stuff, if you can convince them that moving schools and making you quit is bad, they might be able to get your parents to back off a little"
Andrew,^ the counselling part might be a blessing not a curse
Andrew,just try not to see them as the enemy even if they're trying to make you a perfect little christian
Andrew,fuck counseling
Andrew,they've tried to make me go before
Andrew,try to get the counsellor on your side for this
Andrew,if you treat him like trash he'll just tell your parents you're an incorrigible shit and they'll punish you more
Andrew,there is literally nothing more they can do to punish me
Andrew,they've listed literally everything I enjoy or do
Andrew,well if it can't get worse why not try to make things slightly less bad
Andrew,I guess except for my pc
Andrew,idk
Andrew,it literally cannot hurt you
Andrew,I wholeheartedly agree with sylki
Andrew,yeah you guys are prolly right I'm just still pissed
Andrew,fuck I was gonna study for the SAT tonight
Andrew,go for that walk
Andrew,oh well
Andrew,walks are nice
Andrew,I can't
Andrew,walk around the house if you have to
Andrew,I have to wait for everyone to0 go to bed cause I'm on house arrest
Andrew,pace the house if you must
Andrew,moving helps calm down
Andrew,and at worse it's a passive agressive way to keep your parents awake
Andrew,although that might not be a good thing

Andrew,"Top 10 ""Armada Getting Rekt"" Moments"

Andrew,It's super simple to learn
Andrew,You guys are going to be the ones with all the power in this brave New world of ours

Andrew,"@Trapezoider You are always interested in how people learn things so I thought I would share the order in which I learned things in melee (to the best of my memory).
1.    Pick a main (Marth)
2.    Learn basic tech and combos
3.    Switch mains (Sheik)
4.    Switch mains (Jigglypuff)
5.    Learn basic Fox tech
6.    Switch mains (Fox)
7.    Learn the Fox matchup
8.    Learn intermediate Fox tech
9.    Learn the Luigi matchup
(I believe I met you sometime around here)
10.    Acquire a secondary (Sheik)
11.    Learn the Marth matchup
12.    Learn the Sheik matchup
13.    Learn the Samus Matchup
14.    Learn Advanced Fox tech
15.    Acquire another secondary (Falco)
16.    Learn the Captain Falcon matchup
17.    Learn the Falco Matchup"

Even in sad songs it's hard to find songs where they're sung with as much emotion as this one (a lot of the time it's just a sad melody and instrumentals).

Andrew,sick = ill
Andrew,does counting crows have any popular songs? cause I feel like I've heard of them before
Andrew,I've probably brought them up a few times (they're one of my favourite bands)
Andrew,I think I've heard of them too.
Andrew,but their best known songs are probably Mr. Jones and Accidentally In Love (which was in one of the shrek movies)
Andrew,I know them from Mr. Jones. My mom has played that song in the car so many times.
Andrew,"Mr. Jones has over 147,000,000 plays on spotify so i guess you could say its popular "

Andrew,
Andrew,"Sad Songs: Sullivan Street, The Long December, I Wish I Was a Girl, Goodnight L.A., Holiday in Spain, Black and Blue, Possibility Days, Raining in Baltimore (if you're in the mood for a song that's just straight up depressed)
Not Sad Songs (at least musically): Mr. Jones, Rain King, Murder of One, Come Around, Miami, Insignificant, Cowboys, Shallow Days, American Girls, Daylight Fading, Recovering the Satellites

If you like listening to albums, I haven't listened through all their stuff (hence how I just found Possibility Days), but here's a rough breakdown of the ones I do know:
August and Everything After - mostly sad songs/ballads, overall their best album, only one song on it I don't actively like (ghost train)
Hard Candy - more energetic/rock-like, still has some sad songs, but more songs I don't really like (good time, new frontier, carriage) , and apparently there's a deluxe version that has a few songs I haven't heard yet and I should probably check that out at some point. Probably my 2nd favourite overall.
Recovering the Satellites - chill rock, a lot of good songs but not many phenomenal ones. Third best.
Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings - starts out very heavy on a sort of heavy alt-rock sound that I don't really like, then it hits some good sad songs and then mellows out for the end. Each song is kinda hit-or-miss but there are some really good ones. Would be higher if it didn't have as many songs I don't like."

Andrew,@Eric Working From Home
Andrew,i have a secret project im going to show you tomorrow
Andrew,
Andrew,its not your dick is it
Andrew,no
Andrew,Alright @Trapezoider  and @Jed story update
Andrew,I consulted my roommate about his thoughts on the matter
Andrew,"and he was like if that is a dodge, that is the stupidest excuse of all time"
Andrew,"So then she might actually be concussed, so to not seem like an ass I say I hope you feel better"
Andrew,and if you still wanna study just message me
Andrew,"She responded with ""Aight"""
Andrew,bruh
Andrew,it was a dodge
Andrew,It was totally a dodge
Andrew,SMH
Andrew,Yee but like
Andrew,Aight is a weak ass response
Andrew,That's like the last excuse I would use
Andrew,"I dont know dude, this isnt look good. Dont reach out to her for awhile though. When will you see her in person next ?"
Andrew,idk
Andrew,There's a chance that I see her on one of the exam days
Andrew,If we are in the same room
Andrew,if not will you prolly not sere her again?
Andrew,She might be in one of the same classes as me next semester
Andrew,ooh thats guch. I would try to interact as much as possible in person to judge where shes at
Andrew,"With my response though, the ball is in her park"
Andrew,So if she is interested at all she would probably message me to study
Andrew,"If not, she doesn't message me and it's whatever"
Andrew,I hope she does or else shes a huge dork
Andrew,I don't really care considering I know next to nothing about her
Andrew,but is she attractive?
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,
Andrew,"But if she's someone who's gonna dodge with an excuse like ""I got a concussion"" I probably don't wanna be with them"
Andrew,It's like  the boy who cried wolf
Andrew,White lies in the short term solve nothing
Andrew,and only cause more pain
Andrew,Good idea to stay away= from FOLKS LIKE THAT
Andrew,@everyone
Andrew,Any math studying tips?
Andrew,If I do good on this final I have three weeks of bliss
Andrew,Do practice problems
Andrew,^
Andrew,lots and lots of practice problems
Andrew,that's my basic plan for my stats exam
Andrew,I get an 8.5/11 sheet for notes
Andrew,Should I just wright example problems on there too?
Andrew,Or concepts
Andrew,"put the formulas on it, and if there are practice exams that seem to have common questions right those down too"
Andrew,math is for nerds anyways
Andrew,Thanks sylki
Andrew,And doctor
Andrew,no problem
Andrew,anything to procrastinate even more on my own studying
Andrew,(that's a bit of an exagerration I've already studied a solid amount today and I feel pretty justified in taking the evening off)
Andrew,I was gonna study like all day
Andrew,But then I spent the whole morning finishing my shity paper
Andrew,Because I literally FORGOT
Andrew,But doctor is a god and he helped 
Andrew,@Sak von Sak Do your math teachers ever default to weird examples?
Andrew,Because whenever he talks about any type of regression he always does so in terms of frog populations over time
Andrew,occasionally
Andrew,mostly my stats teacher goes off on weird tangents
Andrew,like the time he somehow ended up discussing how he'd much rather have a goat than a ferrari
Andrew,why?
Andrew,Is a goat better than a ferrari?
Andrew,@The Rona

Andrew,"I am very confused. So someone left a comment on a youtube album saying that the album stopped kids from becoming liberals by warning them about the dangers of the world becoming like the one in the album. But the album is about a world where all freedom of expression is basically banned, which kinda happens on both extreme ends of the political spectrum (either agressive safe spaces and everything censored to avoid offending people or on the other end the shutting down of people being some way that they don't like (like gay), and in general on the extremes of both sides just the shutdown of opposing opinions). Funnier still is that the band is a Canadian one so they're probably fairly left by default -_-"
Andrew,"on top of which, this album (and a lot of their other stuff) are basically just about how important music is to society, which isn't a political statement in any way"
Andrew,and I genuinely can't decide if the comment was a bait or not

Andrew,Wait what was the previous chess ai
Andrew,Was it deep blue?
Andrew,Or was that the one from 1993
Andrew,That beat kasperov
Andrew,"Deep Blue was the first AI to take a match from a world champion (it beat kasparov). It did this in 1997. The current best chess engine (at least it was) is Stockfish. Google's new AI is called AlphaZero and it beat Stockfish in a 100 game match with 28 wins, 72 draws and 0 losses. It even won 3 games with black (which is very rare at engine level). AlphaZero achieved this after only 4 hours of learning and is likely the strongest chess entity to ever play the game."
Andrew,How much training data did it have?
Andrew,I love how they name their ai alpha (blank)
Andrew,Alpha go
Andrew,The go ai
Andrew,And now alpha zero
Andrew,But seriously how much training data have

Andrew,@Max why not
Andrew,If I play I'm not going to go tryhard with mains
Andrew,ok thats fine

Andrew,I just don't have the motivation
Andrew,motivation to play a video game
Andrew,for fun
Andrew,with your buds
Andrew,to play well with wrastor i need to grind for awhile
Andrew,oh ok
Andrew,then don't play wrastor
Andrew,^
Andrew,that is my main
Andrew,when I say no main I mean no wrastor
Andrew,in all fairness you said mains
Andrew,which means I probably won't play ori
Andrew,he is also a character that needs practice to play well
Andrew,i feel like if we do a tourney ill prolly get last
Andrew,jed might win
Andrew,if max isnt playing wrastor
Andrew,nah max still beats me anyways
Andrew,"I prolly wont be on till kinda late, like 10EST or later, will you guys still be here?"
Andrew,yee
Andrew,I'll be here
Andrew,@Sak von Sak ?
Andrew,I don't have to go to school tomorrow
Andrew,I'll be there
Andrew,I don't have anything tomorrow till like 130
Andrew,noice
Andrew,my sleep cycle is totally screwey tho
Andrew,"couldn't fall asleep till 4am last night, woke up at 730, couldn't fall back asleep till 9, slept till like 1230"
Andrew,thats me over the summer
Andrew,damn I barely know street fighter but this is a hype tournament
Andrew,I'm just gonna cheer for this one japanese dude who plays the only character I vaguely know how to play
Andrew,I prolly won't be here till 8ish pst
Andrew,im nto sure yet tho
Andrew,jk ima be here
Andrew,ha even armada's watching capcom cup

Andrew,Our man Devon can't watch tonight
Andrew,
Andrew,Tomorrow then?
Andrew,I will be home at like 9 PST
Andrew,Or we just watch anyways XDEEEEE
Andrew,also @Homies I read something about a rivals tournament maybe?
Andrew,"If there is a tourament, it will be late. Although late is relative and since you are PST it might not be that late for you."
Andrew,kk
Andrew,good god this tournament's hype
Andrew,???
Andrew,capcom cup
Andrew,tis a street fighter tournament
Andrew,like the biggest non-evo one of the year
Andrew,LINK
Andrew,https://www.twitch.tv/capcomfighters
Andrew,CapcomFighters - Twitch
Andrew,Capcom Cup Day 2 - Top 32 to Top 8
Andrew,you just missed a nutty winner's finals
Andrew,"@Rivals of Aether ill be there in 30, lets start the tourney then"
Andrew,kk
Andrew,kkk
Andrew,kkkk
Andrew,kkkkk
Andrew,f
Andrew,no
Andrew,pay your respects man
Andrew,street fighter looks so hard
Andrew,apparently this is the easiest street fighter
Andrew,they made a ton of stuff more lenient
Andrew,ah
Andrew,dude nemo tho
Andrew,nemo's the guy I'm cheering for
Andrew,due to having played like 15 minutes of urien once
Andrew,I've only watched one but same
Andrew,urien just seems cool
Andrew,yee let's go nemo
Andrew,This game looks so boring
Andrew,huh
Andrew,I think it looks pretty interesting
Andrew,"but part of that is I probably have a bit of a better idea of what's going on (not by a ton, but somewhat)"
Andrew,I've watched a lot of different traditional fighters and this one seems by far the least interesting.
Andrew,it's not quite as crazy as a lot of them but it's way easier to tell what's going on
Andrew,"imo my favourite one to watch is p4a, shame it's basically a dead game (they released a really good balance patch... only to the arcade version and so like half the community migrated and the other half couldn't and it killed the game for the most part)"
Andrew,I'm so happy to have finally made some progress. I clapped so hard my hands now hurt.
Andrew,(This is minesweeper for those who don't play)
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Andrew,I'm gonna watch till the end of this set
Andrew,which might be pretty fast
Andrew,mmmk
Andrew,@Trapezoider there is a losers bracket
Andrew,why
Andrew,smh
Andrew,So you can have a second chance
Andrew,@Homies R I V A L S O F A E T H E R I S A F U C K I N G G A Y A S S G A M E
Andrew,no u
Andrew,ur mum gay
Andrew,no ur mum gay
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Let me know who wins!
Andrew,ur mum gay
Andrew,@Max I won 3-2 3-1
Andrew,Nice
Andrew,I'm super happy cause it was a great set
Andrew,but I'm still super salty
Andrew,same
Andrew,ugh one game I sd'd at like 5
Andrew,fucking xxxswagdabkamxxx
Andrew,and lost a really important game cause of it
Andrew,@Max come play me
Andrew,I don't want to
Andrew,I only played the tourney as a favor I'm not really enjoying ROA right now
Andrew,melee then?
Andrew,in about 10 minutes
Andrew,kk
Andrew,you are boosted mans
Andrew,I don't understand
Andrew,I've lost 1 out of 10 ranked games
Andrew,"@everyone finally finished putting together a rough outline of a tabletop rpg campaign (basically D&D, but not actually D&D), can I have a show of @me for a rough indication of numbers for who'd be interested? I'm either gonna start running it like, tomorrow evening or in the new year, haven't decided yet"
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,yes
Andrew,@Sak von Sak I might be game
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,@Sak von Sak for kameron
Andrew,hes down
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,can we start tomorrow? @Sak von Sak
Andrew,probably yeah
Andrew,sweet!
Andrew,we got more people than I expected so I'm gonna have to tweak the fight I had planned
Andrew,"but meh, it's fun to put characters together"
Andrew,Now I've got to come up with a clever character that isn't just lawful good
Andrew,tomorrow will probably be like two-ish hours of character creation
Andrew,so you don't need a ton of premise
Andrew,TWO HOURS???
Andrew,yote
Andrew,character creation takes ages
Andrew,especially since you guys don't know the system or any of the charms (there are probably upwards of 100) which form the basis of your character
Andrew,and from what I've found you'll probably get ideas for how you want your character to be as a person as you start putting them together as a bundle of stats and abilities
Andrew,@Sak von Sak rivals?
Andrew,naw
Andrew,hands kinda hurt
Andrew,com'on
Andrew,nope
Andrew,kk
Andrew,thou shalt not tempt me
Andrew,t h o u s h a l t n o t t e m p t
Andrew,t h o u g h s h a l t u s e t h e s p a c e b a r
Andrew,a l o t
Andrew,How similar is the character creation to D&D?
Andrew,ish
Andrew,it's a bit more straightforward imo
Andrew,there aren't clearly defined classes in the same way
Andrew,"which is good and bad - good that I don't have to cover how to play different classes for each person who's playing, bad in that you have a ton of options no matter what"
Andrew,"also there's fewer weird things with equipment and race, and there's no super complex classes where you're choosing religions and the associated weird benefits and stuff"
Andrew,https://i.imgur.com/6LaF38R.png
Andrew,silver snipers op
Andrew,^
Andrew,Where can I find a VOD of them?

Andrew,huh?
Andrew,I'm in for sayori on monika
Andrew,but honestly it's doki doki literature club the characters aren't that that deep
Andrew,yuri is bAD
Andrew,ffs someone play something where there is an actual valid best girl to be had
Andrew,ddlc doesn't have the character depth to justify this much of a best girl fight
Andrew,true
Andrew,do I need the dlc?
Andrew,
Andrew,there's dlc?
Andrew,I'm not arguing for the best. Just that Yuri was the worst by far.
Andrew,Yeahi ts like 20
Andrew,no you don't
Andrew,let people have their opinions tho @ max
Andrew,yeah you communist]
Andrew,Yo im bout to get some cupcakes
Andrew,from the literature club

Andrew,cause he finished daddy dating simulator and needed a new on e:P
Andrew,I didnt even know this game existed

Andrew,its premise is incredibly alienating but it's incredibly good
Andrew,it might sound cheesy but it literally changed me as a person
Andrew,the only way you're getting me to play roblox is as a meme
Andrew,Sylki plays dating sims???
Andrew,just the one
Andrew,It's the only way he can get women
Andrew,wait you don't
Andrew,?
Andrew,gotta fill the void some how
Andrew,and I only started it out of spite so that I could critique people who kept telling me to from a more informed perspective
Andrew,and then somehow I actually ended up really liking it
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,gg
Andrew,yeah hes not gay
Andrew,hes a cool mans
Andrew,@Sak von Sak dating sims are cool
Andrew,in general I will disagree

Andrew,nyoom
Andrew,nyoom
Andrew,same
Andrew,lol
Andrew,"so I've been putting together one last character for day one of the campaign, I might not end up using them cause I kinda made them op as fuck"
Andrew,they kinda got away from my original idea of a graceful grappler kind of a fighter
Andrew,"she can grab you, do a genuinely unreasonable amount of damage, possibly freeze you for as many turns as she does damage, and then while you're frozen trap you in a bubble that will probably take at least two turns to break through even after you defrost"
Andrew,what the fuck dude
Andrew,Thats op
Andrew,This man is a monster
Andrew,"oh and she also has a pretty unreasonable amount of health and defense, a few skills that increase her defense even further, and a skill that can force you to ignore a squishy person until you deal with her"
Andrew,which you're not gonna be able to cause she's tanky as fuck and is just gonna freeze you and trap you in bubbles
Andrew,yo balance these mans
Andrew,dont delete her
Andrew,this lady's getting balanced
Andrew,just tone down?
Andrew,"I'm removing the tankiness and the forcing you to deal with her first, reducing her damage"
Andrew,so now maybe she won't look like this
Andrew,OH MY GOD
Andrew,WHO IS THESE MANS
Andrew,What is the setting for this campaign?
Andrew,modern fantasy
Andrew,im hyped
Andrew,So I can be a school girl?
Andrew,im actually hyped as fuck
Andrew,can I be a columbine shooter?
Andrew,:-:
Andrew,probably not
Andrew,k
Andrew,also yes you can 100% be a schoolgirl
Andrew,Sweet
Andrew,k if theres a sschool girl
Andrew,I might be a schoolgirl
Andrew,when I played this I played a schoolgirl
Andrew,there needs to be a school shooter
Andrew,smh
Andrew,we also had a hairy motherfucker in his midthirties who was kind of a pedo
Andrew,it was hilarious
Andrew,can I be a generic terrorist?
Andrew,not really
Andrew,uGHHH
Andrew,you're kinda prevented from being all that evil by the premise of the game
Andrew,you can only be a little evil
Andrew,Can I be a terrorist whos suicide vest didnt detonate so now he just screams allah ackbar at everyone he meets?
Andrew,please no
Andrew,"although you could, with a bit of work, plausibly be a reusable suicide bomber"
Andrew,it just wouldn't be practical
Andrew,y e s
Andrew,p l e a s e
Andrew,Actually ima be a kekistan memer who lives in his moms basement
Andrew,it's far easier to throw explosives or set traps than attach them to yourself
Andrew,I do not condone this
Andrew,cause you'd need at least one or two charms to make sure you don't die every time you blow yourself up
Andrew,also you need to get the explosives from somewhere
Andrew,yo this sounds complicated as fuck
Andrew,yeah no shit being a reusable suicide bomber is complicated
Andrew,
Andrew,please let me do it
Andrew,Trap
Andrew,please
Andrew,Please fucking let me be  a reusable suicide bomber
Andrew,no\
Andrew,T H I S I S M Y C A L L I N G N I B B A
Andrew,sigh
Andrew,"basic plan at this point is character creation -> test fight with a team I've put together -> tweaking your characters, so you can give it a shot"
Andrew,y e s
Andrew,TTHANK YOU
Andrew,Thank you dungeon master
Andrew,
Andrew,"basic rule #1 of DMing: if it sounds dumb, and your player wants to try it, let them try. If it crashes and burns, you warned them. If it works, then it's fun."
Andrew,My friend tried for like 10 minutes to tame a wolf in some cave
Andrew,My other friend ended up killing in on purpose
Andrew,yo sylki
Andrew,Gotta be honest
Andrew,never played dnd
Andrew,Parents thought it was satanic 
Andrew,lololol
Andrew,"What, how?"
Andrew,so this is gonna be me being fucking autisic and doing dumb shit
Andrew,while everyone wrecks
Andrew,I mean you can basically worship satan in traditional d&d
Andrew,yee
Andrew,I mean
Andrew,my parents are super religious
Andrew,you can
Andrew,I wasnt allowed to play pokemon
Andrew,because they thought it was satanic
Andrew,my childhood was fucked
Andrew,
Andrew,woah woah you're parents are those people??
Andrew,That's a feelsbad
Andrew,ye
Andrew,thats why crazy shit happens sometimes round here
Andrew,"on an unrelated note, holy shit I just realized it's technically possible to have a character who, out-of-the-box after character creation, can summon and control thunderstorms"
Andrew,@mycomputerbeingthrowninagarbagecaninasnowstorm
Andrew,Dibs
Andrew,dibs
Andrew,they can't do... anything else
Andrew,I already called it
Andrew,bids
Andrew,I'm gonna be a little school girl who controls the weather
Andrew,i call shotgun
Andrew,btw you can just... get that a little later
Andrew,
Andrew,it's not even all that good early game because your activation stats will be meh
Andrew,yo do we get mounts?
Andrew,?
Andrew,do we get M O U N T S to increase movement?
Andrew,Like could I theoretically ride a goat into battle
Andrew,yes
Andrew,FUCK YES
Andrew,there's even a fighting style for mounted combat
Andrew,I AM THE REUSABLE GOAT RIDING TERRORIST
Andrew,your goat would die every time you detonated tho
Andrew,how expensive are goats?
Andrew,fucked if I know
Andrew,I haven't looked into it
Andrew,canI just keep buying more goats?
Andrew,theoretically
Andrew,CaN i have a swarm of goats follow me into battle?
Andrew,like the zerg
Andrew,but goats
Andrew,I don't think they'd attack for you
Andrew,I'd have to skim the rules and charms
Andrew,Damn
Andrew,see if there is a possess charm
Andrew,so I could possess all the goats
Andrew,but I'm probably gonna say no just cause that'd make combat a bitch
Andrew,and the goats would all have to have their own turns
Andrew,holy shit yeah
Andrew,and it'd take forever
Andrew,wouldnt we have to roll for every goat
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,yes
Andrew,not fun for the everyone else tho
Andrew,OH MY GOD
Andrew,"Sylki, I didnt realize how hype this game could be"
Andrew,holy shit bois
Andrew,"ok so there is in fact a charm called ""Tame the Savage Beast"" which lets you give animals commands"
Andrew,it has an upgrade
Andrew,oh god
Andrew,swarming: can give orders to a whole swarm of creatures
Andrew,although they have to be small
Andrew,FUCK YESS
Andrew,ie not goats
Andrew,GOATS ARE SMALL
Andrew,GOATS ARE SO SMALL
Andrew,"this is like, small birds/insects/mice small"
Andrew,
Andrew,look how small these mans are
Andrew,@Max brb replacing one of my existing characters with a recreation of Skitter
Andrew,
Andrew,these mans are so small
Andrew,no
Andrew,you can command a single goat
Andrew,okay mans
Andrew,Wait sylki
Andrew,...
Andrew,Is there a charm to miniaturize things?
Andrew,
Andrew,oh dear
Andrew,lemme look
Andrew,technically yes
Andrew,applying it to goats would be unreasonably expensive
Andrew,Don't feed him Sylki
Andrew,he couldn't get all the bits necessary till late game
Andrew,so I don't mind this one
Andrew,"Can I be a really old wise wizard who, instead of dying, opted to transfer his soul into robot/new body (a kid)."
Andrew,Sylki
Andrew,I will make this dream happen
Andrew,My imagination has been empowered
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,nope
Andrew,rip the dream
Andrew,you could be a wise old wizard who did die and was reborn and remembers his past life
Andrew,omg
Andrew,although it's kinda hard to wizard in this game
Andrew,the traditional wizard-style stuff isn't super practical
Andrew,I might add the remembers past life to a different class
Andrew,I USED TO BE A KING
Andrew,and stuff like that could be fun
Andrew,I can't wait to see how your king interacts with trap's lunatic miniature goat herder
Andrew,yes this will be interesting
Andrew,And my Schoolgirl
Andrew,
Andrew,Who may or may not be controlling the weather
Andrew,The king demands it stops raining
Andrew,rains more
Andrew,struck by lighting
Andrew,"just a recommendation, don't build for storms out of the gate, build for storms a few level-ups later"
Andrew,cause if you build for immediate storms your character sucks at first
Andrew,
Andrew,aight buff grappler is no longer op (or buff)
Andrew,"still has that hilarious grapple -> freeze combo, but I removed the additional bubble thing, reduced her damage, health, and defense"
Andrew,"op buff grappler might come back at some point tho, it's too good an idea to pass up"
Andrew,Suddenly a swarm of goats ascends into the air and generates a whirlwind which dispells the storm
Andrew,ok you can't have flying goats
Andrew,I'm pretty sure that one's impossible
Andrew,C H E C K THE RULES
Andrew,See if there is a levitation charm
Andrew,yes but it only applies to you
Andrew,you can't levitate other people
Andrew,
Andrew,wait shit you can
Andrew,Thats actually a bummer
Andrew,but you have to also be flying
Andrew,OKAY
Andrew,SO MY MAN
Andrew,Dang
Andrew,YOU ARE TELLING ME
Andrew,I need this
Andrew,I'll be like storm
Andrew,I CAN LEVITATE WITH A SWARM OF MINITUARIZED GOATS
Andrew,"technically, yes"
Andrew,technically I am about to nutt
Andrew,you will be basically useless in all other situations tho
Andrew,oh shit im prolly gonna die
Andrew,If I dont levelup my characters normal abilities
Andrew,smh
Andrew,"cause the charms you need for the levitating, the size changing, and the size changing applied to goats are all really expensive"
Andrew,like lots of experience to get to them
Andrew,and lots of mana-equivilant to use them
Andrew,damn
Andrew,how long will this run take?
Andrew,for us to complete as a group
Andrew,I have no idea
Andrew,Whats the longest run you have done?
Andrew,once a week for like 8 months
Andrew,Are you willing to DM this all the way through if it takes a million years
Andrew,but I've never DM'd
Andrew,and I don't know how long my planned plot will last
Andrew,Im so hyped bois
Andrew,my advice is roll with a smaller goat-related goal
Andrew,if he gets goats I want wolves
Andrew,no fuck you
Andrew,wOW
Andrew,offended
Andrew,goats > everything else
Andrew,WOLVES
Andrew,jokes
Andrew,are cool
Andrew,its a meme
Andrew,ur a meme
Andrew,same issue as with goats - you can only realistically run one wolf or goat at a time
Andrew,Please tame your flying miniture goats
Andrew,sad
Andrew,then I will have one wolf friend
Andrew,unless you want to spend a fuckton of exp on making them little
Andrew,THEN MAKING THEM LEVITATE
Andrew,christ
Andrew,this is gonna be a good time
Andrew,"on that note, it's 230am, I'm going to bed"
Andrew,'night sylki
Andrew,night sylki

Andrew,I literally screenshot that line when I was playing thinking it fit you perfectly @Trapezoider
Andrew,I wish I could control my desires smh
Andrew,If I could keep the same level of motivation I get for stuff in the beginning over a long period of time
Andrew,I would be a god
Andrew,The only thing I do that with is piano
Andrew,How do I improve this low trait consciencousness part of myself?

Andrew,Kotaku I don't care
Andrew,"""Super Mario Odyssey Player Beats Game Without Jumping"""
Andrew,"Kotaku, I care a little bit about that, but I'm not reading your shit"

Andrew,He never fucking comes to the trench
Andrew,And paraglide around him till his horns turn blue

Andrew,Is that online or in person
Andrew,Also @Sak von Sak
Andrew,Online
Andrew,Can you talk for a few minutes?
Andrew,There aren't really any locals
Andrew,I didn't think their would be
Andrew,"Cool piece of data from an old stats exam I'm doing (this is an actual cited study, ie true data): Researchers tested a sample of women shortly after they had given birth in a large urban hospital. Each mother, blindfolded to prevent sight or smell, felt the hands of her own infant plus two others of the same sex. Of the 68 mothers with at least an hour exposure to their newborns, 47 correctly identified their own baby."
Andrew,What the fu
Andrew,That is incredible
Andrew,"the actual question wanted us to figure out exactly how unlikely that is to occur by chance, and the result was the most extremely unlikely result I've seen in this entire course"
Andrew,even taking into account the relatively small sample size
Andrew,"the exact percentage value isn't even included in the chart we get for calculating exact percents cause it's so unlikely that every point is basically the same, but the actual value ends up being less than 0.000000001% that that result was a fluke"
Andrew,"basically, if it is actually pure guesswork and only 1/3 of the time they should have guessed right, there's a less than 0.00000001% chance that the study would produce those results or results more extreme than that"
Andrew,That's mental
Andrew,Yo is it homosexual to be a mother?
Andrew,"No, it is incest though"
Andrew,Like
Andrew,you had your kid inside of you
Andrew,

Andrew,aggroforlife
Andrew,"@Melee This combo video has a lot of sentimental value to me as it was one I really enjoyed during my early days of melee. It also shows a lot of the story lines of the time and, in a way, is even better now considering we know what will happen with Hungrybox. Just re-discovered this and thought I would share it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKpp7NOwH5w"

Andrew,don't spend it all in one place
Andrew,ye
Andrew,im leaving my rig mining every day
Andrew,and its free because I dont pay electricity
Andrew,so $4 a day
Andrew,not bad over a year
Andrew,spread your marvelous bounty across multiple vending machines
Andrew,Yo just gonna save the btc I get
Andrew,so youre basically stealing from your parents
Andrew,lololol
Andrew,are you fucking retarded
Andrew,You steal by existing
Andrew,I wonder what the actual electricity breakdown is tho
Andrew,All of us did
Andrew,no its charity
Andrew,but there's no way he's drawing enough that it's noticeable
Andrew,then they are being gracious enough
Andrew,to pay my electricity bill
Andrew,well If I was paying it
Andrew,It would be enough to make my profits negligible
Andrew,also the current btc directory is 150 gb
Andrew,smh
Andrew,the blockchain is so huge
Andrew,does it really take that much energy to make bitcoins?
Andrew,yeah you are basically running your gpu on max all day
Andrew,huh
Andrew,do you know what a gpu is?
Andrew,it's the graphics card
Andrew,its a graphics processing unit
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,essentially
Andrew,the calculations needed to generate bits on the blockchain
Andrew,are very similar to graphics processing
Andrew,so gpu's work best for btc mining
Andrew,and running a modern gpu on full power
Andrew,all day

Andrew,"one of my non-exam courses finally got all the marks in, due to the wonder of bonus marks I managed to squeak my 89 up to a 90"
Andrew,which is a huuuuuge deal
Andrew,cause 89 is treated the same as 80
Andrew,and 90 is treated the same as 100
Andrew,"one thing about math stuff is that a lot of the time things that sound super complicated are actually pretty straightforward, but I think I've finally found something that sounds pretty much just as complicated as it is"
Andrew,"""One-way completely randomized analysis of variance"""

Andrew,@The Rona
Andrew,?>
Andrew,how was ur exam
Andrew,my dude
Andrew,good
Andrew,One question that I didn't know how to do though
Andrew,there was a question that i had no fucking clue what the answer was on my programming midterm so i just guessed and got full marks
Andrew,like is was the second most heavily weighted question
Andrew,"""what are the 5 steps of pre planning"""
Andrew,"and i was like i think nityan has said something about DDIT (Design, Develop, Implement, Trace)"
Andrew,but thats only 4
Andrew,fuck just add F to the end and say final test
Andrew,and apparently that was right
Andrew,so I guess an earthquake just happened where I'm at?
Andrew,Are you dead?
Andrew,I wish
Andrew,I didn't even feel it tbh
Andrew,oh prolly cause it wasn't in my city
Andrew,are you suicidal
Andrew,Why would you WANT an earthquake????
Andrew,cause that'd be awesome
Andrew,Dude death by earthquake would be epic
Andrew,I didnt feel it either
Andrew,I think these fags are lying
Andrew,also @Feral Nebula
Andrew,its almost T I M E
Andrew,i s  i t
Andrew,ye
Andrew,It was centralized in mollala so that's why it was weak if that here
Andrew,well we better get used to it
Andrew,were going to be south of the bay area in two years
Andrew,Lots of earthquaks my dude
Andrew,also my phone is almost as big as my switch
Andrew,smh
Andrew,Oi lmoi
Andrew,boi
Andrew,I was playing this cocky ass clairen who taunted after every kill
Andrew,and he taunted before I died last stock game 2 and I killed him for it
Andrew,and then took game 3 as well
Andrew,so satisfying
Andrew,@Jed Which character were you playing?
Andrew,ranno
Andrew,GG
Andrew,destroy all Clairen players
Andrew,but you played Clairen in tourney...
Andrew,that was because sylki revealed what I was actually playing
Andrew,but still
Andrew,you used what you despise
Andrew,ye
Andrew,hes right
Andrew,you refuse to teach me clairen
Andrew,because you dont want anyone playing clairen
Andrew,then you play him in tourney
Andrew,Why do you think I took the character choice path I did in melee
Andrew,the logic here actually makes sense
Andrew,I picked the character that beat my previous character the hardest until I got to fox
Andrew,Marth to Shiek to Puff to Fox
Andrew,if you hate op characters
Andrew,why the fuck do you play fox lmao
Andrew,Fox is not OP
Andrew,he has weaknesses
Andrew,so does clairen
Andrew,He wouldnt be beatable if he didnt
Andrew,not in the same sense
Andrew,I DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING
Andrew,AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED ANYTHING
Andrew,DON'T PIN THIS ON ME
Andrew,to beat clairen you just have to play better
Andrew,also kameron wrecked your Clairen thus not OP
Andrew,To beat fox you have to play better
Andrew,Clairen has not real exploitable weakness
Andrew,thats literally how rivals goes
Andrew,lmao
Andrew,you must play better
Andrew,Clearly false if kam can beat you?
Andrew,"poor you, you have to play better to beat someone"
Andrew,my Clairen has under 2 hours total play time
Andrew,boo hoo
Andrew,By play better I mean play better + extra
Andrew,so you can play better than them and still lose if it isn't by enough
Andrew,Also the fox matchup...
Andrew,lmao
Andrew,Falco Marth and Samus all go even with fox
Andrew,no one goes even with clairen
Andrew,How can that be true lmao
Andrew,which part?
Andrew,No one goes even with clairen
Andrew,From my experience either her range or her down b make her beat every character
Andrew,Then get gud
Andrew,^
Andrew,or play a better game
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,you gonna take that shit?
Andrew,I think max complains too much about a character that I've heard commentary from good players
Andrew,Real talk I still almost always beat Clairen on ladder and against Jed. I just think the character is stupid.
Andrew,so get gud does not really apply
Andrew,I'm already good I just don't have fun when playing against her
Andrew,games are meant to be fun
Andrew,"I dont have fun playing against fox. Does that mean fox is bad, and we should all complain against fox?"
Andrew,so it isn't a matter of OP just a matter of not liking the matchup
Andrew,Are you gonna quit melee because you hate the falco matchup?
Andrew,No
Andrew,cause I don't like playing against Zetters
Andrew,You grind the matchup
Andrew,DO YOU THINK I ENJOY SAMUS PUFF
Andrew,and get good
Andrew,it does apply
Andrew,DO YOU
Andrew,Why would you play melee if you you hate the matchup that you will be playing more than any other @Trapezoider ?
Andrew,Because I like conquering the thing I despise with all my heart
Andrew,that was really only right after the dlc dropped
Andrew,Its why I play the game
Andrew,Its also why I go through cycles of not
Andrew,playing
Andrew,Because I get frustrated and do rage quit the game because of dumb matchups I suck at
Andrew,But
Andrew,I kEEP  COMING BACK
Andrew,but you still enjoy conquering the hard matchup
Andrew,I don't
Andrew,Because the eternal alure of the mountains I have to climb is more addicting than most thrills in life
Andrew,hence why I never play bad characters in anything
Andrew,The only thing Im pointing out why its dumb for you to complain about a strong character
Andrew,Because you are the guy who defaults to strong OP characters
Andrew,
Andrew,strong does not equal over powered
Andrew,Semantics
Andrew,naw actually that's valid
Andrew,but still
Andrew,I think you're overreacting to clairen
Andrew,^
Andrew,If I liked her I would play her
Andrew,I've been annoyed about it for a while just never said anything
Andrew,you did play her...
Andrew,for a day
Andrew,In tournament
Andrew,ONE MATCH FOR THE MEME
Andrew,that is not evidence
Andrew,that was not for the meme
Andrew,"Why am I getting attacked over hating a character??? If Sylki randomly decided to post ""I hate falco"" I garuntee this wouldn't happen. Let me have an opinion."
Andrew,you were mad that I said you weren't playing clairen
Andrew,which you thought told kameron who you were playing
Andrew,so you played clairen
Andrew,I do hate falco
Andrew,but I sucked it up
Andrew,and I'm now pretty good against falco
Andrew,honestly I think that Rivals is a fairly balanced game and its moreso playing the opponent than whatever character they choose
Andrew,same with sheik
Andrew,I sucked it up and I'm alright at the matchup now
Andrew,now you are a G 0 D
Andrew,its all about the grind matchup isn't important
Andrew,so my brother works at uber
Andrew,and apparently he takes an uber to work every day
Andrew,"and frequently has a conversation that basically goes:
uber driver: so, where do you work?
my brother: oh, I work at uber.
uber driver: neat, how long have you been driving for them?
my brother (presumably insufferably smug): hahahaha no I'm an engineer at uber."
Andrew,Does he get free Uber credits tho
Andrew,yeah he gets like $200 free uber a month
Andrew,
Andrew,yo that man is straight up about to revolutionize the way we transport
Andrew,Uber published a 95 white paper on electric VTOLS
Andrew,I read the whole thing
Andrew,Im hooked
Andrew,@Sak von Sak

Andrew,he's doing some thing for people to sign up

Andrew,yeah I think we still get net neutrality lol
Andrew,finally a widely acceptable way that canada > us
Andrew,The vote went 3-2
Andrew,It passed
Andrew,Canada here I come 
Andrew,"Better health care, net neutrality"
Andrew,"there's a lot of things I like about canada over the us, they're just not things that are universally appreciated (like free health care, gun control, adding 'u' to the spelling of words that don't strictly need it but imo it looks better, a more logical election system, better skiing, not being a terrorist target, etc.)"
Andrew,Better skiing 
Andrew,it's true
Andrew,mostly just cause we've got more area that has good skiing weather so statistically we get more good mountains for skiing
Andrew,you guys get a bit of the rockies and that's about it
Andrew,"okay Google, how do I get Canadian citizenship"
Andrew,honestly you can kinda just show up and ask nicely
Andrew,if you live here and have a job at least
Andrew,So not an extremely long difficult process like the us?
Andrew,"we have a system that basically ranks you based on how much we think you'll benefit our society which takes a bit to get through (especially if you get ranked low), but honestly upper middle class white people showing up and getting a job on visa is pretty much a guaruntee that you'll get citezenship"
Andrew,it's not instant but it's faster than the states
Andrew,
Andrew,"one thing that was kinda funny is that the states introduced a plan kinda like that, where people get ranked based on desireability and some canadians were acting all offended and like 'wow that's not a nice way to decide citezenship, canada's above shit like that'"
Andrew,@The Rona Going to see Star Wars tonight 
Andrew,noice
Andrew,it's supposed to be reaaaally good

Andrew,my showing is the first
Andrew,prescreenings exist
Andrew,especially for reviewers so that they can have people say it's good to get more people to come watch on opening night
Andrew,I normally don't trust mass opinion of whats good. I'm just hoping it isn't a copy paste of Empire Strikes Back like the last one was a copy of A New Hope.

Andrew,so I guess he knows
Andrew,So he's okay with you vaping?
Andrew,I don't think so
Andrew,I was giving it to them because my mom was concerned that I would be tempted by it while they were gone
Andrew,cause I'm tryna sell it
Andrew,Would you have used it if they didn't take it?
Andrew,nah
Andrew,I don't have anymore juice
Andrew,I'm just tryna sell it rn it is kinda pointless

Andrew,ay wrenchd is playing in the rcs tourney today
Andrew,I agree
Andrew,bruh what if you looked through a 1 way mirror and on the otherside was a mirror
Andrew,cause wouldn't it just reflect nothing?
Andrew,or reflect a reflection of a reflection
Andrew,it'd be just like two mirrors reflecting each other
Andrew,just without you being in it
Andrew,but like
Andrew,what does a mirror look like
Andrew,it reflects light
Andrew,whatever light is present will be reflected back and forth between the mirrors
Andrew,literally all mirrors are one-way mirrors with a solid thing stuck to the back
Andrew,"the reason one-way mirrors work is cause one side is way darker than the other, and on the light side enough light is being reflected that you can't see the stuff on the other side"
Andrew,I highkey wanna buy a one way mirror now
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,Ok
Andrew,The Last Jedi was really fucking good
Andrew,like a room like this
Andrew,
Andrew,but with an external light source
Andrew,so you don't see all the lights reflecting
Andrew,problem with external light is that then you'll just see the outside
Andrew,that only works because the light is on the inside
Andrew,ah
Andrew,I see the error now
Andrew,Who the heck is using the Frostbite gamers Twitter account?

Andrew,yo non-whites check your privilege
Andrew,So what was that about white privilege again?
Andrew,lol

Andrew,THEN WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME IF IT WON'T AFFECT MY LIKELIHOOD BEING HIRED
Andrew,"Because equality only applies to those who are not white straight males obviously, because we already have the whole of the white supremacist patriarchy on our side."
Andrew,Things like this might be why the number of liberals decreases as age increases.
Andrew,maybe
Andrew,I think it's mostly just society moving left over time so the younger generations will be more left just by virtue of being born in a lefter time

Andrew,@Homies Looks like Nier Automata isn't part of the holiday sale.
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,should I buy skullgirls?
Andrew,its 2 dollars
Andrew,Its worth $2
Andrew,Just know its very different from smash games
Andrew,kk'
Andrew,it's pretty good
Andrew,but on the flip side neither me nor max is really playing it anymore
Andrew,max just kinda isn't and I'm mostly playing blazblue and guilty gear
Andrew,more things go on sale as the time passes
Andrew,but it's good for if you're not sure if you'd like traditional 2D fighters and want to give it a shot
Andrew,If you buy the game I'll pick it back up and learn a new character
Andrew,My old main was garbage as a solo
Andrew,eh yeah if you buy it and max picks it up again I will too
Andrew,but if you main peacock I'm disowning you
Andrew,any character where explaining how to get around their basic zoning takes more than six minutes is a character whose shit I refuse to put up with
Andrew,"oh also you might be amused by this game just cause, at least until he picks a new main, my best character is more or less the best in the game and max chose one of the worst -_-"
Andrew,*unknowingly
Andrew,same on my end
Andrew,"I just saw the guy who taught me playing them and went ""hot damn that looks sick"""
Andrew,and my other character I mostly started playing cause they have a skin that makes them look just like my favourite character from persona 3
Andrew,I picked my character because she has the least suggestive outfit
Andrew,lol
Andrew,"I still think it's pretty funny that of the two clone characters, one of whom is meh and the other is top tier you chose the lower tier one"
Andrew,is skull girls sketch bois
Andrew,define sketch?
Andrew,FAN SERVICE
Andrew,I mean yes
Andrew,but they mix things up with it so that it's not pure fanservice
Andrew,"like the character who's basically a bunch of limbs stitched together and can stretch those limbs out on individual tendons, throw her head at you, and wrap you in a ball of intenstines"
Andrew,or the character who is literally just made out of blood
Andrew,what the FUCK
Andrew,or the unholy monstrosity that is my best character
Andrew,thats fucking nasty
Andrew,who is a shapeshifting undulating flesh blob
Andrew,but there's plenty of characters with basically no fanservice
Andrew,like big band
Andrew,who is basically a ton of brass instruments in a trench coat
Andrew,and with two on screen this is a thing that can happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qcjCnkbROY

Andrew,still great tho
Andrew,and his lv5 super you have a little space to just jam out on the trumpet while time is stopped and if you end on the right four notes it activates
Andrew,"brief history of why this is hilarious before I post the clip, in team fighting games, if you catch an assist and point character at the same time, it's known as a Happy Birthday"
Andrew,"taken to its logical conclusion, https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyDepressedSpiderPeteZaroll"
Andrew,KPBLive Playing Skullgirls - Twitch Clips
Andrew,Happy Birthday - Clipped by MegaMissingn0
Andrew,That is amazing
Andrew,but in general it's not too hard to make teams where none of your characters are particularly fanservice-y
Andrew,my current team is these two:
Andrew,
Andrew,and I'm probably gonna add either you
Andrew,or you
Andrew,"on the flip side you could always run eliza, valentine, and cerebella:"
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,but if you do that max's head might explode
Andrew,I would also refuse to play against you except late at night
Andrew,just you wait till I get you to play street fighter 5 and then pick up r mika
Andrew,like seriously who thought this was reasonable
Andrew,I've played street fighter and I thought it was super boring
Andrew,it's mostly neutral
Andrew,whereas sg is mostly punish
Andrew,and I mostly just wanted to show that skullgirls isn't actually all that bad in terms of fanservice in fighting games
Andrew,but I don't think I could bring myself to play someone whose design is that much shameless fanservice
Andrew,I think the upshot of this whole discussion is you should all drop like $30 on guilty gear so we can learn together and I can fight you with a reasonably dressed girl who can summon motherfucking dolphins
Andrew,I've seen that character
Andrew,She looks pretty fun
Andrew,"on top of which, playstyle-wise she's pretty much what I look for in a character - good zoning, but when you get in you can go ham"
Andrew,"There is a chance I do buy it, but before I do, I want to have a conversation about the game."
Andrew,I've only played like an hour
Andrew,and only in tutorial and training mode
Andrew,so I dunno if I can give a serious recommendation yet
Andrew,i played the game for a bit i wasnt a fan adn refunded it
Andrew,combos felt clunky
Andrew,and hte punish game seems weak
Andrew,every move is safe on block from what i could tell
Andrew,from what I've heard the execution is reallllly tight
Andrew,no idea about the safe on block bit
Andrew,from watching it seems like there are definately safe block strings but they're not infinite
Andrew,and this is a personal thing thid doesnt make the game bad but i prefer button block to directional block
Andrew,i think i recall skullgirls had directional
Andrew,but dont quote me
Andrew,yeah it does
Andrew,don't like... all fighting games?
Andrew,at least all the ones I've played do
Andrew,blazblue's got a weird mix
Andrew,well i mostly play mortal kombat
Andrew,i mean i still like fighting games that also have directional block like MvC
Andrew,MvC is a crazy looking game
Andrew,its a fucking nutty game
Andrew,"never played it, but it feels a bit too much like two-touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, you win"
Andrew,its more like
Andrew,low sweep to uppercut knockup to 100-0 air juggle
Andrew,i mostly just like the characters
Andrew,love capcom and marvel so
Andrew,combo of hte two always nice
Andrew,my friend  plays the shit outta street fighter and i cant do shit agianst him
Andrew,he mains ryu and im like hey man could you just play someone different so i dont get 100-0'd and he says yeah then swaps to ken
Andrew,like thanks man he has the exact same moveset
Andrew,lololol
Andrew,apparently they're pretty different in sfv at least
Andrew,but not... any other game really
Andrew,ay apparently pubg is officially out of early access and they optimized a ton of stuff
Andrew,yeah it is
Andrew,it looks super good
Andrew,its fun
Andrew,I played so much last night
Andrew,might take a stab at it again and see if my computer can handle it
Andrew,@Trapezoider @Jed you man's are living together?
Andrew,nah
Andrew,I'm just at his house for 2 days

Andrew,if you can get anything probably evo
Andrew,or big house
Andrew,I would do big house over evo honestly.

Andrew,but its also vegas
Andrew,which is probably more expensive
Andrew,and my parents probably wont let me go to vegas alone
Andrew,but big house is in maine right?

Andrew,or you could come to goml 
Andrew,where is that?
Andrew,canada?

But, if you ask to use the machine, specifically to do some photocopying (ie, something that sounds like a reason but is actually just a redundant statement of what you do with a photocopier) the percentage of people who'll let you cut ahead jumps back up to 93%, only 1% less than if you give a valid reason"
Andrew,if someone told me they were gonna use the photo copier to make spaghetti hell yeah im gonna let them go ahead of me i wanna see where hes going with this
Andrew,"naw it's more like they go ""Can I use the photocopier? I need to make some copies."" and you're 33% more likely to let them use it than if they just ask ""Can I use the photocopier?"""
Andrew,i like my version better
Andrew,@The Rona due to the strike instead of my final math exam being cumulative of everything we've learned its only about logarithms and straight lines
Andrew,ez marks
Andrew,we couldn't even finish the logarithms unit so its only the easy logarithm stuff
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,In addition if you add the word because it increases your likelyhood i.e
Andrew,"""I need to use the photocopier because I am in a rush and need to make copies"""
Andrew,Are you in a psych class?
Andrew,based on what the study was comparing (actually having a reason vs. having a sentence structure that sounds like a reason but isn't) that would be around the same as just saying that you're in a rush
Andrew,naw I just stumbled across it
Andrew,my fuckin family got one of those smart thermostats and so during the day when nobodys home the house is freezing to conserve energy but im fucking home during hte day they dont change it for the days i dont have college
Andrew,why arent you back in school yet?
Andrew,School isn't all day at university/ college
Andrew,Dont you guys live on campus?
Andrew,I thought you were dorm boys
Andrew,dorm is really only a first-year thing in canada
Andrew,Devon lives at home because the school is close
Andrew,Dank
Andrew,I go to a different school than him though
Andrew,You go to waterloo right?
Andrew,Yup
Andrew,daNK
Andrew,art thou in their coop stuff?
Andrew,"Im in a ""Digital literacy class that is an absolute meme"
Andrew,"cause they have like, the best co op in the country"
Andrew,This is for people whomstve havent even used computers basically
Andrew,plus you dont go to school everyday in college usually @Trapezoider
Andrew,like i only have school 3 days a week
Andrew,what
Andrew,lucky bastard
Andrew,There is a super attractive female next to me. Im gonna get her name tomorrow
Andrew,Then number
Andrew,I've always had five days a week
Andrew,Welcome to college Sylki
Andrew,Five days a week for me
Andrew,but Im out by 1:30 everyday
Andrew,I almost didn't this term but I had to move a course from first to second term so I'm right back on five days a week
Andrew,welcome to mixing and matching your courses so you get a good schedule
Andrew,and my stuff's mad spread out some days
Andrew,although one of my days is 8-6
Andrew,I'm not in a co-op program
Andrew,I hate that shit
Andrew,"today, I have 5 hours of class spread from 830am to 930pm"
Andrew,I want all my classes to be back to back
Andrew,I can still do it though if I want to
Andrew,back to back classes is great
Andrew,Wait doc you dont have females in your classes?
Andrew,TF
Andrew,"however, cause it's the first day of classes, I skipped my 830 cause they're just gonna go over the syllabus and I would only have had like 4 hours of sleep, and my 630-930 class got cancelled cause the prof has flu"
Andrew,i have a 3 hour break on thursdays but me and my boys jsut go into town and get food during it
Andrew,That's not what co-op means
Andrew,lol
Andrew,Thats what is means here
Andrew,co op is mixed school and work terms
Andrew,so you get a fuckton of experience by the time you graduate
Andrew,im aware of what co-op menas
Andrew,"It's basicly like an internship where you go an work for a company, but you get paid"
Andrew,andrew isn't tho
Andrew,Ive always heard it in referring to genders
Andrew,Thats dank as fuck
Andrew,im in the college with the #1 rated co-op program in ontario
Andrew,oh
Andrew,internships are actually paid pretty often
Andrew,the terms are almost interchangeable at this point
Andrew,just that internship can mean you don't get paid
Andrew,true
Andrew,you get paid in experience
Andrew,yay
Andrew,yeah but that blows
Andrew,im gonna buy all the stuff with this experience ive earned
Andrew,I ain't applying to no unpaid internships
Andrew,what is the ratio of experience to bitcoins?
Andrew,the same as the ratio of leprecauns to unicorns
Andrew,http://puu.sh/yX1Jg/2cc62ab9e5.jpg
Andrew,Anyone wanna buy .05 of a bitcoin
Andrew,"thats like $10,000"
Andrew,no
Andrew,its $700 usd
Andrew,no it really isnt
Andrew,devon
Andrew,"still, one thing I prefer from my school's internship stuff vs waterloo's coop is that waterloo does 4-month so you're basically in, trained, given some menial tasks for three months then booted out, whereas we do full-year stuff so you actually get better experience"
Andrew,http://puu.sh/yX1L4/3087ec02dd.png
Andrew,you are fucking wrong
Andrew,"bitcoin are $15,000 usd"
Andrew,"15,000 * .05 =$750"
Andrew,What are you smoking?
Andrew,he said .05 not .5
Andrew,oh you said .05
Andrew,DORK
Andrew,not used to people not putting a 0 before hte decimal place
Andrew,fucking americans
Andrew,Those god damned yankees
Andrew,that's not uncommon here
Andrew,just not super common either
Andrew,bruh i aint never seen it
Andrew,wut
Andrew,is the GTA just like a mini america inside ontario
Andrew,Devon I can assure you that we have seen it
Andrew,ye
Andrew,cause dont you people call like chapstick blisterrods or something
Andrew,basically
Andrew,we also have aids here
Andrew,lol not really
Andrew,@The Rona well im sure if i actually looked at the board during math call i'd have seen it
Andrew,also I've literally never heard the word 'blisterrod' in my life but it sounds horrible
Andrew,what do you call chapsticks
Andrew,isnt there like a wierd nickname
Andrew,i could've sworn
Andrew,"sometimes it goes by one of the brand names (blistex), like kleenex instead of tissues"
Andrew,blistex
Andrew,thats what it was

Andrew,"one

Andrew,
Andrew,max it means I left 3 hours after
Andrew,and just got home because I got asked to go buy groceries
Andrew,Still down?
Andrew,I'm eating but I'll play after
Andrew,GUYS! I NEED HELP! I feel like characters on the left are a stolen design of characters from the Fate Series. If you've seen the Fate series please help me out here!
Andrew,"I mean, same hair eye color"
Andrew,there are a few Fate parody type things
Andrew,they might be from one of those
Andrew,where did you find this?
Andrew,"I made it myself, I took the left screenshots from an anime, I don't know the name of it, but the opening is called Apron Boy"
Andrew,"When I first saw these characters, I initially thought it was an ending to a Fate anime, but then I saw that it was an opening and not even the same series"
Andrew,is it from this? https://myanimelist.net/anime/37033/Emiya-san_Chi_no_Kyou_no_Gohan
Andrew,Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan
Andrew,A Fate/stay Night spin-off focused on cooking.
Andrew,I think it is.
Andrew,"well yeah, it's not stolen then it's just a spin-off"
Andrew,besides I don't think character theft is a thing that happens in the anime industry
Andrew,but what do I know
Andrew,"Thanks for clearifying that, and I didn't think they were stealing the characters, I thought they were stealing the designs and naming them different characters"
Andrew,"But one last thing I do find strange is that, Spin-Offs (or at least the ones I've seen) usually have a different cast of characters with members of the previous cast making side appearances. But I could be wrong"
Andrew,I haven't seen many spin-offs so I don't really know. I guess there's just different ways to do it
Andrew,maybe
Andrew,@Trapezoider I'm ready
Andrew,@Trapezoider We playing PUBG or not?
Andrew,I'm cracking up
Andrew,this kid I know from kingston used to play tf2
Andrew,apparently
Andrew,one of his teammates thought he was a girl
Andrew,and was kinda sorta hitting on him constantly
Andrew,which the kid didn't discourage
Andrew,it eventually culminated in the guy buying the kid a csgo knife
Andrew,he is living the trap dream
Andrew,Did the guy ever find out?
Andrew,yeah after awhile the kid felt kinda bad and told him and asked if he wanted the knife back
Andrew,"to which the reply was basically 'naw you're a chill dude, keep it'"
Andrew,wow what a guy
Andrew,why give hte knife back
Andrew,he scammed it fair and square
Andrew,How expensive was the knife?
Andrew,um
Andrew,lemme check
Andrew,"according to the steam market, $81.45"
Andrew,Not bad
Andrew,so like $65 usd
Andrew,respectable scam
Andrew,i used to scam people in warframe out of platinum
Andrew,made like ~$200 worth of plat off it
Andrew,I'm fufilling my namesake
Andrew,Time to start scamming bibbas by fufilling mh destiny

Andrew,and hoooly shit the plot twist
Andrew,never have I ever seen such a comprehensive plot twist
Andrew,something that somehow seeped into like... everything
Andrew,What are you reading?
Andrew,it's part of an unfinished series (book 3 of an eventual 10)
Andrew,"The Stormlight Archives, by Brandon Sanderson (my favourite author, and probably his best series thus far)"
Andrew,fucking impressive plot twist
Andrew,it was even the kind of thing where it's like 'there is going to be a plot twist about this'
Andrew,but I was not expecting anything like this
Andrew,@deleted-role

Andrew,okay
Andrew,join when ready
Andrew,kk
Andrew,what matchups do you wanna do
Andrew,When your parents leave can you join voice?
Andrew,also is genesis tomorrow
Andrew,No I can play
Andrew,Wen I went down
Andrew,They told me not to play games
Andrew,So I gotta wait
Andrew,Genesis is this weekend
Andrew,early events may start thursday or friday though
Andrew,I am probably going to start on falco
Andrew,kk
Andrew,After that we can play Shiek Falcon
Andrew,kk
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,yeah?
Andrew,"random thought - we have the term 'shot dead' for someone who is shot, and dies from it, but we don't have similar terms for other ways of dying or getting killed"
Andrew,no 'stabbed dead' or 'drowned dead' or 'heart attacked dead'
Andrew,english is weird
Andrew,we're the only language where a double positive can result in a negative
Andrew,wait how
Andrew,yeah right
Andrew,lol
Andrew,I will still hold up verbal quebecois french as the most comprehensive idiomatic butchering of a language
Andrew,four twenties ten 
Andrew,naw that's just the language
Andrew,I'm aware
Andrew,I'm talking more the degree to which they mash english in and randomly remove syllables
Andrew,fuck saying 'petit' (small) let's just say 'tit
Andrew,"fuck saying 'voiture' (car), two syllables is too many let's just use the english word for it"
Andrew,le tit snow
Andrew,"also, in some rural regions in quebec they just randomly add 'la la' to the end of every sentence despite it having no semantic meaning within the sentence"
Andrew,also they invented a completely separate set of swear words
Andrew,which results in some truly unique cussing that you just don't really get to see in english
Andrew,"because they'll mash together quebecois swearing, french swearing, and english swearing"
Andrew,cause each language's/dialect's swearing has different stuff that's considered swearing so you can get really inventive
Andrew,I've almost paid for pubg by selling crates
Andrew,Nice
Andrew,How much dollar
Andrew,I haven't been playing since the update so no crates for me
Andrew,Also Jed can you hang this weekend irl?
Andrew,I'm at like $20
Andrew,and idk
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,yikes
Andrew,Were you heavily invested in cryptocurrencies @Trapezoider ?
Andrew,what caused the crypto bubble to finally burst?
Andrew,"dammit. I had a controller coming in for a bunch of fighting game stuff, was supposed to arrive tomorrow, but they showed up today only no one was home cause it wasn't supposed to come till tomorrow so they just took it back till tomorrow"
Andrew,it literally changed nothing from my expectations but I could have had it tonight and that makes me mad
Andrew,"fuck you too psychology, why'd you invent loss aversion"
Andrew,I'm not sure whats happening today but I just had a perfect game in rivals the other guy didn't even touch me
Andrew,everything seemed really slow
Andrew,"I've only ever had one such game. They are rare and special, I hope you enjoyed it."
Andrew,so I put a sandwich in the toster oven (wanted to heat the insides too)
Andrew,"the top slice of bread, the one exposed to the air, burned to a crisp"
Andrew,"the bottom one, the one pressed against the hot metal?"
Andrew,"lightly toasted, slightly damp"
Andrew,I do not understand thermodynamics
Andrew,@Trapezoider Still interested in melee tonight?
Andrew,duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude
Andrew,"I just won a solo
I dropped gun range and went to bunker but someone was there so I went for a uaz

Andrew,also let this be a lesson to work on your mentality
Andrew,if you took my lessons seriously you would be way better
Andrew,mentality isn't a joke
Andrew,if you don't mind getting bodied you'll play way better
Andrew,was a huge turning point for me
Andrew,I mind getting bodied by someone who has been playing for 1/32 the amount of time I have
Andrew,huge ego destruction
Andrew,"like if you watch the handful of sets I'm on stream, I'm laughing at myself and me getting bodied and silly things"
Andrew,going in with a positive attitude literally makes everything better
Andrew,be happy for the other person doing sick stuff to you
Andrew,"and afterwards consider what you could have done better, what worked, and what didn't"
Andrew,keep the negativity for analyzing yourself later
Andrew,The reason you are not good with your number of hours is because your hours are not meaningful. They are just random friendlies. You don't watch as many tournaments as Kameron (which I consider to be very important) so he knows how top level players move and combo. He also takes advice all the time while you just want to play a specific way and are too stubborn.
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane I challenge you to a best of 9 set january 27th at 11pm EST

Andrew,including egg yolk
Andrew,which has sunk into the fabric
Andrew,this backpack is officially fucked
Andrew,I guess instead of getting work done and going to office hours I'm instead going to have to go way out of my way to somewhere they sell backpacks and get a new one
Andrew,RIP Sylki's backpack~ Unknown-2018
Andrew,amazon same day delivery
Andrew,I'm barely gonna be home today and if you miss the delivery stuff gets weird here
Andrew,and I'd have ot go way out of my way to the UPS place to pick it up
Andrew,Here they just leave it at the door
Andrew,Same
Andrew,unless its something super expensive like a phone
Andrew,student housing is too sketchy for that here
Andrew,like anything could get stolen

Andrew,Sweet. I'll review those on my lunch break
Andrew,Sylki do you ever miss classes?
Andrew,occasionally
Andrew,I don't recommend it
Andrew,my basic rule is I will skip review classes of stuff I already know really well or early morning classes if I get less than 5 hours of sleep
Andrew,or classes where the prof is so legendarily awful that it's easier and faster to skip the class and read the slides
Andrew,That's a good rule to follow. I had to miss one today and I kinda wanted To die.
Andrew,Ugh my teachers are lazy and don't make slides
Andrew,just make sure yoou catch up on what you missed
Andrew,Thankfully we have blackboard and I can do everything from I class online. Do you guys use blackboard?
Andrew,nope

Andrew,dem custom skins are wack
Andrew,true
Andrew,mostly don't look like what they say they look like
Andrew,also it'll take one hell of a skin to make me give up on my coral kragg
Andrew,coral krag?
Andrew,
Andrew,@Trapezoider coral kragg
Andrew,I always get a bit sad looking at the really nice custom skins I have for characters I never play -_-
Andrew,god this assignment is annoying
Andrew,"""There is no solution to this. Just try to find the closest thing you can."""
Andrew,and it's not like math where you can get an answer that still has some variables in it
Andrew,there's literally no way to get from the starting point to an equivilant - if vague - end point
Andrew,@here games?
Andrew,maybe in a bit I've got a bit more work to do
Andrew,cool-cool
Andrew,
Andrew,@Zain I'll preorder as soon as you do
Andrew,but I thought you had to preorder it before the closed beta started
Andrew,but idk
Andrew,@SWIRL GIRL if you pre order now you get into the closed beta everyone is playing right now but I don't think am gonna buy it cuz it ends in like 2 days I'll prob buy it when I comes out
Andrew,I have found a kragg skin that I would replace my coral kragg with
Andrew,shame you have to buy it
Andrew,
Andrew,Now I'm hungry.
Andrew,Yeah burrito kragg is cool
Andrew,oh also kameron a top etalus confirmed with me that orcane beats etalus
Andrew,no word on orcane kragg yet though
Andrew,Once you get to the top tho matchups matter less
Andrew,Still true tho
Andrew,I somehow ended up in a weird roa discord for ontario/quebec and it seems pretty chill
Andrew,also we might be entering a crew in a tournament where the winning team gets burrito kragg skins
Andrew,I doubt I'm good enough to be on the crew though
Andrew,What's the name of it?
Andrew,it's only for ontario/quebec people
Andrew,so I doubt you're in it
Andrew,Aight
Andrew,Just know there's a crew tourny coming up that my crews gonna be in
Andrew,aight now I have to try to get into this crew if it's the same tournament
Andrew,I want to die
Andrew,I just spent 20 minutes debugging a four-line program
Andrew,how
Andrew,the problem was I used the wrong kind of quotation marks
Andrew,...
Andrew,"' ' instead of "" """
Andrew,fuck haskell
Andrew,like if its 4 lines id literally jsut rewrite hte htiung
Andrew,I did
Andrew,it still didn't work
Andrew,cause apparently haskell's picky about your quotation marks
Andrew,but the error message won't tell you that htat's the problem
Andrew,it was telling me the problem was on the line after that
Andrew,well i mean wanting you to actually use quotation marks rather than apostrophes isnt really picky
Andrew,every other language I've ever used doesn't care
Andrew,they've always been the same thing
Andrew,but now they're not
Andrew,and I can't tell what the actual difference is
Andrew,i spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why my program kept skipping an input and realized i have a buffer overflow
Andrew,ah that's always fun
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether GOML 2018 might have RoA
Andrew,Nice
Andrew,anyone who might show if it does? cause apparently they're trying to gauge interest atm

Andrew,might make my own crew
Andrew,Yeah it's not exclusive to canada
Andrew,didn't think it was?

Andrew,hour or two
Andrew,not sure how long the lab's gonna take
Andrew,"and especially because it's a programming thing built around a concept I've never actually used before, it could be super simple or take ages"
Andrew,this is some of the worst debugging I've ever written
Andrew,there's so much redundant stuff
Andrew,but it was useful like half an hour ago
Andrew,and I'm afraid to delete it in case it becomes useful half an hour from now
Andrew,@Melee I got invited to the Icons closed beta! I'm under NDA though so please don't ask me questions about the game.

Andrew,sure
Andrew,"alright, technically I can beat jed"
Andrew,"practically, it takes like 15 tries and a lot of salt"
Andrew,ranno's jank
Andrew,so are platforms
Andrew,but not at the same time
Andrew,the count was 11-3 or
Andrew,but some of those were sylvanos
Andrew,yeah at least one of them was us seeing if sylvanos jab spikes
Andrew,and you killed yourself three times in like twenty seconds
Andrew,oh true
Andrew,"still, once I was more warmed up we had close matches"
Andrew,I would have won that one kragg one if I hadn't killed myself by fastfalling next to the stage instead of onto it at like 20%

Andrew,My plan was to never actually mention what someones number was but others have given specific numbers. I would guess that they are random but you should check with whoever wrote the chapter.
Andrew,okay just making sure no one has some foreshadowing on those numbers or a purpose to them
Andrew,In college business class

Andrew,I am creating the DC calendar
Andrew,Let's get these dates locked down ASAP
Andrew,dont you already know mine?
Andrew,Ye but send me your schedule
Andrew,For summer
Andrew,@Zain @Feral Nebula @Trapezoider @Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane @The Rona The spreadsheet has been made and should be in your email
Andrew,"So bros, my parents track my phone and are super oedipal and annoying about knowing where I am. Today however I found a very convienient app that can spoof my location. :) Life just got a lot better"
Andrew,lol gg dude
Andrew,
Andrew,on a scale from 1 to tm06 how toxic is this
Andrew,@Homiesgames?
Andrew,"andrew, I feel for you and all, but I'm pretty sure oedipal is not the right word"
Andrew,oedipus (or however you spell it) was the guy who banged his mum and killed his dad
Andrew,I'm gonna assume you just meant anal
Andrew,"as in anal retentitive, as in super control-freak-y"
Andrew,if you can spoof your location you can fool your parents but also think of how easy it would be to play pokemon go
Andrew,@here games?
Andrew,shut the heck up
Andrew,ok
Andrew,"apparently, if every chicken dinner in pubg was an actual chicken dinner, enough have occurred that you could feed the population of iceland for a year"
Andrew,I don't know who goes through the trouble of figuring this stuff out
Andrew,but it's great
Andrew,@Sak von Sak melee or pubg or somethin?
Andrew,naw studying atm
Andrew,kk
Andrew,got midterms next week
Andrew,@Sak von Sak post that canada pic about the population
Andrew,what if he don't
Andrew,i cri
Andrew,I don't have it
Andrew,it was never me
Andrew,pretty sure ocean man's got it
Andrew,@Sak von Sak pretty sure oedipal was the word I was looking for. In my context it means the helicopter mother and father who are emotionally dependant on me and take away responsibility I should have for myself by being over protective and over bearing
Andrew,dude raisins are gay
Andrew,craisins however
Andrew,NUT
Andrew,but that's not what happened in the story
Andrew,
Andrew,he was abandoned
Andrew,I'm not talking about the story????
Andrew,cause prophecy saying he'd kill his dad and murder his mum
Andrew,It's a word from frued
Andrew,but that's where the term comes from?
Andrew,he used it in the context of the story
Andrew,Pretty sure it's from civilization and it's discontents
Andrew,oedipos complex is freud's thing
Andrew,Oedipos and oedipal are different
Andrew,http://www.dictionary.com/browse/oedipal
Andrew,the definition of oedipal
Andrew,https://youtu.be/EPAfS8-wm8g
Andrew,Jordan Peterson: Female Pathology (The Oedipal Mother)
Andrew,Full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek
Andrew,I think we're having a definitional mismtach here
Andrew,I need to update my knowledge of this topic
Andrew,'spose they're different meanings for the same word
Andrew,I was running off that video essentially
Andrew,"but in common perception, oedipus-related stuff immediately goes the mother-fucking route"
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,a statement which is based in a different psychologist's work -_-
Andrew,"Yeah I read your definition and I was like ""fuuuuccckk"""
Andrew,Basically sees his dad as a sexual rival lmao
Andrew,jung get out of our freud-based discussion dammit
Andrew,That's fucked up dude
Andrew,Yeah get the fuck out Jung
Andrew,eh I like Jung's stuff honestly
Andrew,who tf is Jung?
Andrew,Fucking coming in here with your collective unconscience
Andrew,Stupid bitch
Andrew,"well the main thing is the idea of the collective unconscience, which is ironically usually misunderstood"
Andrew,Jed he was essentially Sigmund Freud 2.0
Andrew,aight
Andrew,"the way jung has it is that it's the collection of ideas, archetypes, and such that are common to basically everyone - symbols that pretty much everyone will understand and associate with the same things"
Andrew,"amusingly, the collective unconscience is often represented as a literal collective, shared part of the uncounscious mind that is in some way attached between people"
Andrew,so the collective unconscience isn't really a part of the collective unconscience
Andrew,"also Jung and Freud were pretty different in how they approached stuff, from what I remember"
Andrew,although Jung did carry on some of Freud's stuff I'm pretty sure mmost of his theories were pretty different
Andrew,it's been awhile since I took psych so I'm gonna go dig this up
Andrew,While we wait for sylkis notes
Andrew,@Rivals of Aether Jed?
Andrew,for a little bit
Andrew,sylki do you know a rivals player named sableye?
Andrew,he is in Ontario I think
Andrew,he's in that discord but other than that I dunno
Andrew,aight
Andrew,@Trapezoider get in nerd
Andrew,"they both worked a lot with the unconscious, but Freud focused more on repressed, but still present stuff, as well as the id/ego/superego stuff and the kinda wacky psychosexual stuff for describing behaviour, whereas Jung focused more on the shared stuff between people, how we understand society and ourselves in relation to it"
Andrew,sadly one of the major reasons I remember as much about Jung as I do is that the persona games kinda swooped in and built a lot of the series off his theories (especially Personas 4&5) - Jung is literally the guy who came up with the term 'Persona' in the way that it's generally used today

Andrew,I dont know what certifications are in canada
Andrew,But here in the states
Andrew,EZ
Andrew,only have my bronze medal and TBH im not fit enough to get the cross rn
Andrew,oh in canada you need to complete 3 seperate 12 week courses
Andrew,so ive done two
Andrew,havent finished the third
Andrew,for lifeguard shit?
Andrew,Damn canada
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,well its your job to ensure safety of the public
Andrew,Mine was one week of training/testing for certifcations
Andrew,so id assume it'd be pretty hard
Andrew,really?
Andrew,damn america is wack
Andrew,How long are the sessions?
Andrew,2 hours
Andrew,It was 8 hours a day for 5 days
Andrew,but only once a week
Andrew,oh
Andrew,okay it comes out similar then
Andrew,America is retarded but definitely not that retarded
Andrew,"2x12x3=72
8x5=40"
Andrew,TIL you cant use * to show multiplication on discord
Andrew,Ye i just checked my calculator because something didnt seem right with me saying they were close
Andrew,32 hour difference
Andrew,LYike
Andrew,TBH you can easily cover it all in 32 hours especially if you have them back to back
Andrew,so its not that wack
Andrew,40*
Andrew,my issue i couldn't finish was hte distance swim
Andrew,i mean i did finish it
Andrew,but barely
Andrew,how long?
Andrew,300 m right?
Andrew,1600m in 12 mins
Andrew,did you have to do the brick?
Andrew,100m pool 16 lengths
Andrew,oh yeah the brick was fine
Andrew,Brick = ez
Andrew,the brick was weird cause you could jsut stand on the bottom
Andrew,without floating back up
Andrew,TF?
Andrew,We did it in the deep end
Andrew,yeah no im saying
Andrew,when you are at the bottom of the pool usually you float up
Andrew,@Max Melee?
Andrew,but with the brick you can just stay on the bottom
Andrew,so it felt weird
Andrew,Oh yeah
Andrew,I like chilling on the bottom with the brick
Andrew,same
Andrew,Sneaky snekking my way around
Andrew,Grabbing peoples legs
Andrew,we always had to cram the swimming stuff in the first hour cause for the second hour the synchro team would take like half hte pool
Andrew,so it meant even when our instructor was just talking to us we had to focus on not sinking since we could only have the deep end
Andrew,Are you going to complete your certs?
Andrew,i really should
Andrew,@Trapezoider how do I aquire such a test drive
Andrew,go on the website and apply
Andrew,here ill send link
Andrew,wait shit you have to be 21. I need to cancel 
Andrew,Lmao
Andrew,Rip
Andrew,finishing your certs isn't that that hard
Andrew,so long as you have decent eggbeater you're fine
Andrew,I got mine and then never managed to actually get a lifeguarding job -_-
Andrew,now they're pretty much all expired
Andrew,I'd have to do all the hardest ones all over again
Andrew,mango is at the cs_summit
Andrew,eggbeater?
Andrew,treading water with legs only technique
Andrew,super useful for carrying people
Andrew,especially for spinals where you have to move at a constant pace or risk causing way more damage
Andrew,@Trapezoider for spinals do they teach the Canadian hold thingy in the states?
Andrew,.+
Andrew,for spinals we actually use a backboard and try to stabilize as best we can until the backboard can be used
Andrew,The goal is to get the person into shallow water and maintain stability of the spinal erector and neck
Andrew,Since we dont really know the extent of a given injury
Andrew,Man sylki you and I become more and more similar the more i get to know you
Andrew,
Andrew,wait did they not teach you spinal carry stuff for before you can get them to the board?
Andrew,They did but I dont remember 
Andrew,dammit now I don't get to know if they taught you canadian carry
Andrew,which they'd better have cause it's the best
Andrew,I have no idea :(
Andrew,

Andrew,actually I cant play at all
Andrew,highest HP boss in the history of gaming:
Andrew,
Andrew,I see your boss and raise you http://xenoblade.wikia.com/wiki/Gradivus%2C_the_Headless_Emperor
Andrew,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor"
Andrew,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor (Japanese: 首無皇帝グラデウス, Kubinashi Kōtei Guradeusu) is a Tyrant in Xenoblade Chronicles X. It is a member of the Millesaur family. It can be found at level 71 at the..."
Andrew,"100,000,040 health"
Andrew,also for the record this is a lv71 enemy in a game where the level cap is 60
Andrew,i see your boss and I raise you again (i found this on reddit)
Andrew,also where'd the extra 40 come from on that xenoblade boss?
Andrew,no idea
Andrew,but that is its health
Andrew,the post-game bosses in this game are stupidly strong
Andrew,cause there's a lot of weird optimization stuff
Andrew,there's a boss that's 39 levels above the level cap
Andrew,ie a lv99 when your max level is 60
Andrew,that I can understand a little because they wanted to make it like other RPGs where the level cap is 99
Andrew,"I tried taking it on as a joke at lv56, I got one shot"
Andrew,tpk in one hit
Andrew,you have to optimize so hard to win
Andrew,I remember one time I took on a boss (which I didn't think was a secret boss) at a low level and I got one shot. I took me about three days to realize that he actually was a secret boss.
Andrew,"I generally try to stay away from RPGs that require the use of so many complicated game mechanics (like optimizations, synthesising, equipment boosting, etc). Most of the ones I play have them, but I can ignore them and still manage to beat the game (main story at least)."
Andrew,main story's totally manageable without any particular optimization
Andrew,but they left some crazy stuff in for the crazy people
Andrew,so they'd have some ridiculous completionist challenge
Andrew,"yeah. For me, I just really only play games for their story aspect. If I really enjoyed it I'll go back and try to 100% it."
Andrew,"same, but I do think it's cool"
Andrew,also the particular crazy enemies are super interesting in terms of design and lore in this game
Andrew,"intersting. I've never tried a Xenoblade game, but now I'm curious. Any recommandations to start with?"
Andrew,start with the original
Andrew,if you've got a wiiu/switch I think you can get it on the virtual console
Andrew,xbc1 is one of my top 2 rpgs
Andrew,I don't have a wiiu or a switch
Andrew,ooooor you can just emulate it
Andrew,unless you want to pay like $100 for a wii copy
Andrew,yeha no thanks
Andrew,xbcx is pretty good but it's more worldbuilding and sidequests than a direct story
Andrew,haven't played xbc2 cause I don't have a switch
Andrew,"also I don't know how the timeline of xbc1 and 2 work, but xbcx is totally separate"
Andrew,is xb a wiiu/switch specific game?
Andrew,it's nintendo specific
Andrew,ah that explains it
Andrew,"original was wii, X was wiiu, 2 is switch"
Andrew,I'm really more of a ps fan
Andrew,have you played any of the persona games?
Andrew,I wanted to play persona 4 but I wasn't old enough when it came out. I DESPERATELY want to play Persona 5! I looks SOO COOL!
Andrew,god p5 is good
Andrew,it's the other of my two favourite rpgs
Andrew,if you've got ps3 I think there's versions of personas 3-5
Andrew,"p3 has versions for ps2, ps3, and psp, p4 for ps2 and ps3, and p5 for ps3 and ps4"
Andrew,i have both a 3 and a 4 so I'm kinda in luck
Andrew,yeee get p5
Andrew,I'm trying to
Andrew,is it hard to find a copy? or just not enough money?
Andrew,not enough money
Andrew,aw
Andrew,just starve yourself for a week
Andrew,it's worth it
Andrew,lol
Andrew,"btw, if you like persona 5, are you going to watch the animation coming out soon? Just curious?"
Andrew,yup
Andrew,"if possible I'd recommend playing before watching, the adaptations are a little less deep"
Andrew,and especially in the case of p4 the pacing's wack
Andrew,that is if they don't change the story progression first
Andrew,both adaptations have been pretty faithful
Andrew,I remember one of my favorite games got an anime adaption and it complete changed how the game was
Andrew,slight changes to accomadate the protagonist not being a player-insert character
Andrew,"but other than that, consistent"
Andrew,admittadly the faithfulness is what caused the p4 adaptation to be weirdly paced
Andrew,well yeah they kinda have to cram the possibly 20+ hour game into a 12 episode season
Andrew,that sounds like it would end badly
Andrew,"i wouldn't if they divided it over 2 seasons, which the anime adaption of my favorite game did but poorly"
Andrew,20+ hours should probably be 50 episodes at least
Andrew,"most likely, but you got to think, most of that time is possibly running around looking for what your doing, travel time, and filler content"
Andrew,true
Andrew,so theoetically it would really be 10-15 hours
Andrew,"with persona games pre-5, they were like 60ish hours but a lot (probably 20-25 hours) was storyless combat, and they always have to trim side stuff (which is a lot of persona games), but they manage to fit just about all the important stuff in"
Andrew,and that's what important. Though I don't mind the occational filler episode since they're the funniest
Andrew,p4's got great filler
Andrew,"cause it's so character focused, it doesn't even feel like filler"
Andrew,I don't even know why you would put filler in a movie
Andrew,movie where'd that come from? (and you wouldn't)
Andrew,Persona 4's adaptation is a movie I think?
Andrew,no it's an anime
Andrew,naw that's backwards
Andrew,"p4 is a 25 episode anime, p3 is 4(?) movies"
Andrew,"but yeah, fillers can be good, as long as they progress the story or develop the characters even a little amongest all the fan service"
Andrew,one of the p3 movies has one of the best hot springs bit I've ever seen
Andrew,there's plenty of character development but it's also just funny
Andrew,and not much fanservice
Andrew,one of my favorite fan service bits from a game was a hot springs bonus scene from a game called Tales of Xillia 2. Oh my god it's freaking hallarious! You really don't even need to understand the game to think it's funny
Andrew,basically what happens is the guys are swallowed by this living doll (that's actualyl a party member) because the girls didn't want them around. And they end up getting digested in the doll's stomach. It's the dialogue that makes it funny

Andrew,release it now as well
Andrew,on some non trapezoid yt
Andrew,kk
Andrew,just got in like a ten minute argument of me vs the majority of the ontario rivals discord about discord light vs discord dark
Andrew,I have successfully convinced them that it's ok to use the light theme
Andrew,so now hopefully no one's gonna get on my case for using it
Andrew,Fuck you Sylki. I do not like you because you use white discord
Andrew,that's racist
Andrew,you don't like me cause I like white
Andrew,"in all seriousness there are valid arguments against white, but 'it's too bright it hurts my eyes' is BS"
Andrew,"it's the exact same white as like, everything else on your computer"
Andrew,"behold, a screenshot of discord, where part of the picture is a screenshot of a word document"
Andrew,IT'S THE EXACT SAME COLOUR
Andrew,Ack! My eyes!
Andrew,It burns

Andrew,uwu
Andrew,Thai food is infact dope
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,Join the master race. Discord white is superior and all of the discord dark people can  kiss my ass
Andrew,ew gross I didnt know you used discord light
Andrew,we're not friends anymore
Andrew,eat ass
Andrew,no
Andrew,go die
Andrew,smoke grass
Andrew,
Andrew,and sled fast
Andrew,
Andrew,"""Sled fast, eat ass"" - Dan the Meme man"
Andrew,"brief reasons why I use discord light:
1) anyone who says it's too bright is fucking stupid. It's the same white as everything else on your computer that uses white - word, facebook, google, etc. - and you can clearly manage it just fine there.
2) my eyes are borked and reading light text on dark background gives me brutal headaches if I do it for too long, which happened a bunch when I tried out discord dark.
These are objective facts. You can say you think discord dark looks better and that's fine, but don't try to tell me that it's too bright and don't tell me I should give myself brutal headaches to match your aesthetic sense."
Andrew,Why do guys care about this so much?
Andrew,It doesn't even matter.
Andrew,except I have applied a dark skin to a majority of my web services
Andrew,^
Andrew,"I only care cause any time I put a screenshot up everyone goes 'ew discord light' and I feel victimized, you monsters"
Andrew,and I always have discord up on my other monitor so it does tend to feel bright
Andrew,so I feel the need to explain that due to actual physical problems discord light is better for me
Andrew,There is nothing wrong with light
Andrew,also I get annoyed at the 'it's too bright' thing
Andrew,yeah that's fair
Andrew,light's not right
Andrew,but people like trap who just use it cause they are dumb
Andrew,thats who we can make fun of
Andrew,I still think it's dumb to make fun of people for preferring a different visual style
Andrew,unelss they think ping pong the animation looks good
Andrew,in which case hell yeah I'll make fun of them

Andrew,I'm not quite sure how because based on the bracket he just randomly appeared in loser's round of 24 and then lost 2-3
Andrew,"he's not in any round before that, in winner's or loser's"
Andrew,this bracket's super weird

Andrew,
Andrew,@Eric Working From Home if you give me the entire file i can help you out
Andrew,http://puu.sh/zx0Tf/c88135a0d2.zip
Andrew,"Yeah you can summon a group of objects in Java, but can you summon Lord cuthulu?"
Andrew,summonLordCuthulu();
Andrew,you're need to create an object to call the method
Andrew,so
Andrew,"AbyssalLord C = new AbyssalLord;
C.summonLordCuthulu();"

Andrew,I'll hopefully be able to acquire a working mic by then
Andrew,is it coup
Andrew,yup
Andrew,Can I join too?
Andrew,sure
Andrew,depending on how many we get we may need to split into two groups
Andrew,is there a maximum number of players?
Andrew,more than 4 would be awkward I think
Andrew,you can't play with more than 7 but at that point it's a complete and total mess
Andrew,why?
Andrew,more than 4/5 would be hard
Andrew,I want to keep it civil
Andrew,"too many things to keep track of the more people you add, also you start running out of cards"
Andrew,I think that having more people would be better because you can use the cards people have discarded by dying to try and figure out if someone's lying or not
Andrew,The more players there are the less turns you get and the less each player matters
Andrew,also you can't use cards people died and left behind
Andrew,i suppose thats true
Andrew,Okay but boys whats up with this http://puu.sh/zxS8Y/c9282f5e8f.png

Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture. One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.

When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school, while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends. Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the shadows of his past.

Andrew,time to pray for lenient prof
Andrew,I have a 12% assignment due tonight that I've been brick walling since monday
Andrew,but I've missed office hours because I'm sick
Andrew,so I'm totally fucked
Andrew,I sent him an email and hopefully he'll extend it for me or just drop it entirely
Andrew,but we'll see
Andrew,Good luck my dude
Andrew,How fooked are you if he doesnt help you out here?
Andrew,What class is this for?
Andrew,"it's scientific computing, which is a brutal class (super wacky linear algebra mixed with programming)"
Andrew,and I'm really fucked if he doesn't help me out
Andrew,because I was super duper behind and got a 0 on the previous assignment and a 0 on the previous test
Andrew,like I'm currently failing the course
Andrew,not because I don't get it but because I fell super far behind last time I was sick
Andrew,"Sylki, I'm here for you my man. If you need to study for a test thats like memorization stuff I'll do online flash card review with you. I don't know the concepts but I can question you on then if you give me a review packet. Also can you give me a basic rundown on what linear algebra is, how it different from normal algebra, and what's it's current applications in computer science are? I have heard a lot of the deep mind guys talk about linear algebra having direct technical uses in machine learning"
Andrew,"For optimizing ""fitness functions."" I barely understand any of this shit, so please enlighten my .0001% understanding"
Andrew,Linear algebra is about vectors
Andrew,In layman terms
Andrew,"Okay the only context I understand vectors in is when closed cycle rocket engine ""vectors"" it's thrust to change directions"
Andrew,Is there any analogy you can draw from that to the maths?
Andrew,Its mostly about representing linear equations from what I understand
Andrew,yes but that's a super simple way of thinking about it
Andrew,it's basically super wack math that's not really analogous to anything else at the point I'm at
Andrew,"in terms of usage, it's really good for machine learning and data analysis"

Anyone who wants in please let me know!"

Andrew,what time?

Andrew,Tfw you think you're getting tinitus but then you track the high pitched ringing sound to your refrigerator
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,that is such a thing I would do
Andrew,Tfw you've always had tinitus and thought that everyone else did too
Andrew,How would you even figure out that everyone else doesn't?
Andrew,I mentioned it to my mom one time like last year and she was like oh yeah that's not normal
Andrew,Hey that's how I figured out it was a problem that I mostly only looked out of one eye
Andrew,"Dominant eye is a thing, but it's not supposed to be that dominant"
Andrew,But I didn't realize that until I told someone about it
Andrew,how do you only look out of one eye ??
Andrew,Long years of unintentionally trainin myself
Andrew,Probably stemming from having had a lazy eye when I was really young
Andrew,I've had to manually retrain myself the last two ish years
Andrew,And its kinda sucked (lots of headaches)
Andrew,But I'm pretty much fixed now except when I start to get really tired or spend too much time frequently changing focus
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,I shouldnt expect to have this correctly?
Andrew,How do I test if I do?
Andrew,Itd probably cost you but you could get it checked out by an optometrist
Andrew,"In general though, you should be aware of the ability to swap focus between each of your eyes while pretty much completely ignoring the other, and a difficulty using both at once"
Andrew,"A good simple test - hold two pencils out in front of your nose, one roughly 8-10 inches away and the other 2-3 times that. Focus on the close one, and in your non-focused field of view you should see two versions of the far pencil. Don't worry of this doesn't pop up immediately or if it's hard to look for the split while keeping your focus on the close one, worry if you can't do it at all or if it's really hard to get the split."
Andrew,It's not a perfect test but it's something I had to train myself to be able to do and apparently it's a pretty normal thing most people can do
Andrew,is it good or bad to get the split?
Andrew,Good
Andrew,Cause that means both eyes are focused up close
Andrew,it happens pretty much automatically for me
Andrew,"And since they both have different angles to the far one, it creates the split"
Andrew,Yeah you're fine then
Andrew,"Out of curiosity, are you able to unsplit while keeping your focus close (ie doing what I used to do automatically)"
Andrew,let me try
Andrew,no not really
Andrew,the only way to remove the split is to focus on the far one
Andrew,that's super weird
Andrew,"Well that's good, odds are you'll never fall into the same trap I did"
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,Seems like im good
Andrew,Thank you for all the insight
Andrew,Are you close to being fully healed?
Andrew,More or less
Andrew,It still kicks I occasionally and a few things with it are still messed up (including the reading white text on dark background thing) but overall it's pretty much better

Andrew,"whaaat, I didn't"
Andrew,is it official?
Andrew,"Not yet, but Game Theroy made two videos breaking down Doki Doki and they concluded that it's getting a second game in 2018"
Andrew,Based on Doki Doki's hidden backstory
Andrew,I dunno if Game Theory has the authority to declare something like that 100%
Andrew,More like gay theory tho
Andrew,He wasn't the one who came up with it though. It was a whole ARG that people solved
Andrew,"It's actually really cool and I'm super excited if this is true, which it most likely will be since they're pretty accurate with their theories"

Andrew,it's kindof an eyesore
Andrew,"either ariel, calibri, or cambria should be the primary font for scholarly works"
Andrew,not times new roman
Andrew,also 1.1-1.3 line spacing is much more asthetically pleasing than 1.5-2 line spacing

Andrew,bless
Andrew,cause this book is super boring dude
Andrew,hey
Andrew,i need some weeb peoples opinions
Andrew,@Feral Nebula @mrd256
Andrew,so like we're having this debate
Andrew,theres a lot more weebs than that here
Andrew,do you think it was possible for hte people in SaO
Andrew,to like
Andrew,fuck
Andrew,ingame
Andrew,lol
Andrew,why is that a topic of conversation
Andrew,dont worry about it
Andrew,it started off with some guy asking if he should get sea of thieves and we're here now
Andrew,have you ever seen sao
Andrew,ye
Andrew,and they never definitivley answer
Andrew,if you cna fuck or not
Andrew,like
Andrew,the main bitch strips then smacks the dude in the face
Andrew,but thats as close as they get
Andrew,Imma say yes
Andrew,But I'm no weeb so my opinion doesn't hold much water
Andrew,well considering she did strip chances are its possible
Andrew,As long as they have genitals and can experience tactile sensations
Andrew,okay so one of my main bitches linked me some SaO Smut and apparently its cannon that they can fuck
Andrew,its not actually smut im like 80% sure its a cannon novel
Andrew,but dont quote me
Andrew,yeah but the whole point of the question is we don't know if they do or not @ trap
Andrew,Did the girl who stripped have genitals?
Andrew,for some reason I read that like the girl had her genitals stripped
Andrew,she stripped to her underwear so its unclear
Andrew,"so i got my boy james on the whole genital issue and all he said was ""idk they had dicks and pussies in the hentai i watched"""
Andrew,james is high rn so hes not super helpful
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,okay so like
Andrew,the other girls in the guild have fucked b4
Andrew,so id assume they have genitals
Andrew,tfw you play too much counter strike and get carpal tunnel
Andrew,yo we should get some 8 man pubg going sometime
Andrew,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Andrew,Yo somebody kick this guy
Andrew,Yo I just saw a police officer take somebody off a train with a m4 assult rifle and they say Canada dosent have guns lol but truthfully sorta spooked me a little
Andrew,Where the fuck do you get an M4 in Canada?
Andrew,Did the cop have it or the dude
Andrew,fusion had it
Andrew,Oh duh
Andrew,the cop lol but yes i also have an m4
Andrew,Arrest this man

Andrew,Also I asked them about it in their discord and they were super condesending
Andrew,@Jed wanna join a cs team? We lost a guy and need a lurk
Andrew,I mean I'm kinda bad
Andrew,Also what's the time commitment?
Andrew,"I think we'd be playing around 4 nights a week. It would basically take up the free time you spent on rifles in pubg to some degree I imagine, but I still think it would be pretty fun to be on the team together. Especially since I'm not complete ass at the game now"
Andrew,Prolly not

Andrew,You have to go through customs when crossing the border?

Andrew,You know what I mean

Andrew,oh
Andrew,Only like 7-8 hour drive
Andrew,True
Andrew,When you said customs I thought that you were referring to them checking your bags and stuff

Andrew,@Max melee?
Andrew,doing school work
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,I have defeated you
Andrew,??
Andrew,
Andrew,???
Andrew,I'm confused
Andrew,it has something to do with fairy tail but other that I have no idea
Andrew,"I just watched an episode of fairy tail where all the main characters turned into Batman. And they broke the fourth wall by saying ""oh no she's turned realistic"" considering such an odd episode I thought it might be funny enough to get you to watch so.e"
Andrew,Some*
Andrew,didn't work
Andrew,Fuck
Andrew,Nigerian whore sack
Andrew,you're not supposed to start with saying you've defeated me
Andrew,Somebody kick this guy
Andrew,it encourages me to disprove you out of spite
Andrew,also this wasn't particularly inspiring
Andrew,Sylki I am determined to get you to watch this show
Andrew,@Sak von Sak melee???
Andrew,Sylki 1v1 me rust
Andrew,"I'm more curious to know how DBZ wrangled its context to include the line ""Hold your fire, this man isn't black!"" with a straight face"
Andrew,I can explain
Andrew,If you watch fairy tail. I am a sucker for million episode shows
Andrew,That never end :(
Andrew,That is what long shows tend to do
Andrew,Except fairy tail is over now
Andrew,So is dbz
Andrew,which is why they tend to suck
Andrew,Except the movies that come out
Andrew,"dragon ball is still going, dbz might be done"
Andrew,Fairy tail definitely has some shitty story arcs not gonna lie
Andrew,The highs are high but the lows are meh
Andrew,"and my stance on super long shows is basically: I could watch several great short shows in this time, maybe I""ll do that instead"
Andrew,What kind of show even is it?
Andrew,the highs are bad the lows are terrible
Andrew,why do you want someone to watch it with you so badly?
Andrew,wait
Andrew,ill watch it with you
Andrew,i dont have anything better to do
Andrew,@Trapezoider
Andrew,"so I'm gonna watch made in abyss, and re creators, and higurashi, and grimgar, and monster, eureka 7, and your lie in april, and monster, and a fuck ton of other stuff first"
Andrew,"""the highs are bad the lows are terrible"" ""I'll watch it with you"" MAKES SENSE"
Andrew,am down to watch a bad show
Andrew,I mean it can be fun to watch something with the intention of laughing at it
Andrew,you still haven't finished made in abyss???
Andrew,a gonna have fun making fun of it
Andrew,see: me watching girls und panzer
Andrew,ava I have watched like nothing in the last month and a half other than watching kill la kill with you and andrew

Andrew,"Random thought: denotations of time make no sense. I mean days are reasonable - it's the time it takes to start dark, get light, then get dark again and you sleep in the middle - and so are years - turning of the seasons, earth going around the sun, etc. - but the rest are irrational. What is an hour? a minute? a second? a week? why do they fit so badly into each other? who designed this stupid system?"
Andrew,Still better than the imperial system
Andrew,I'm pretty sure the hour is used to tell the position of the sun
Andrew,yeah but why are there 24 per dday
Andrew,that's an arbitrary number
Andrew,especially cause you can't see the sun for half the day
Andrew,same thing with weeks
Andrew,like I get it's pulled from god making the earth in seven days
Andrew,but it's still weird
Andrew,"at least months almost make sense cause thye're matched up to the cycles of the moon, sort of"
Andrew,The system makes more or less sense depending on where you live
Andrew,Also it takes 24 hours for the earth to complete one revolution on its center axis
Andrew,yes but why TWENTY FOUR
Andrew,like what is one hour that made us decide to use it as a measure of time? we have one day for one rotation of the earth
Andrew,That doesn't not make 24 an arbiratry number trap
Andrew,Yes it does
Andrew,Because 24
Andrew,>0
Andrew,Get rekt
Andrew,nerds
Andrew,What
Andrew,
Andrew,Tfw ur mum gay
Andrew,get  out of my christian minecraft server
Andrew,Which one? @Jed
Andrew,you heccin tard
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,When are you back?
Andrew,At like 6
Andrew,The ur mum gay bit was aimed at trap
Andrew,Because with his logic the gay clearly transferred
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,gay traps > octagons and doctors
Andrew,This just in the entire medical community is deemed worth less than one gay trap
Andrew,@Sak von Sak time is done the way it is because it is in a base 6 number system
Andrew,"60 seconds

Andrew,When?
Andrew,4-4:30 PST is start time
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,Buy that esea my guy. Ill pay you at the gym tomorrow
Andrew,@deleted-role I have created a meetup planning document. Please join it.
Andrew,"on my exam today I wrote one of the most disgusting single lines of code of my life, which I will try to replicate here:"
Andrew,| mod (length list) 2 != 0 = take (((length list)/2) - 0.5) (zipWith (+) list (reverse list)) : (head (reverse (take (((length list)/2)+0.5) list)))
Andrew,it's highly efficient but it's such a mess
Andrew,What does this even do?
Andrew,"A direct translation of what it's doing: it checks to see if the length of a list is divisible by two, and if it isn't, it takes the first half (rounded down) values from a new list that it creates where each element is the sum of an element in the list plus that same position in the list if the list was backwards, and then concatenates that to the first value of the reverse of the first half (rounded up) values in the original list

A more straightforward explanation: if a list cannot be divided into two halves of equal length, it creates a new list where each element is the sum of the list folded over onto itself (so the first value plus the last, the second value plus the second last, etc., and the final value is just the middle value)"
Andrew,"normally I would not do that in a single line, but in haskell you kinda sorta gotta unless you want to write ten times as much code"
Andrew,I originally wrote out the whole function (which is more than just that) as way more code but I had spare time so I decided to write out the more efficient version I figured out halfway through an unrelated question later on the exam
Andrew,I condensed like a page of code into three extremely disgusting lines
Andrew,of which that was the worst
Andrew,Damn son
Andrew,also I get to cheerfully come home and start studying for my monday exam -_-
Andrew,"someone put together a single slide deck of all the slides the prof said to study, and this is on the first slide"
Andrew,fuck me

Andrew,@Zain sorry buddy :(
Andrew,Are you getting hit by this storm as well @Zain
Andrew,Does anyone know if hereditary memes can change the gene pool of a population to express different phenotypes more or less?
Andrew,Memes are not hereditary
Andrew,Hereditary memes?
Andrew,are you okay?
Andrew,Memes as in the cultural ideas that pass from mind to mind as first proposed by Richard Dawkins are hereditary in a sense. If you parents possess the meme of religion you are more likely to receive this meme from then
Andrew,Religion is not a meme
Andrew,That's not what he means by meme
Andrew,A meme is a unit of cultural evolution
Andrew,Religion is something that has evolved over time with culture
Andrew,Religion = scientific meme
Andrew,Not funny meme
Andrew,memes predate religion
Andrew,The reason I ask is because I have noticed a quarelation between religious females and their attractiveness. Not to say there aren't attractive atheist.
Andrew,I have actually noticed this too
Andrew,what
Andrew,"I might just have the ""I grew up in a Christian home"" bias"
Andrew,saying you find religious ones more attractive?
Andrew,^
Andrew,Possibly
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,There appears to be a quarelation greater than .6 linking thicc and religiosity
Andrew,are you sure its not just confirmation bias?
Andrew,I'm not
Andrew,"There has actually been research that conservatives are on average more attractive. So since most Christians are conservative, maybe that is the correlation."
Andrew,I want to test it
Andrew,Research must be done
Andrew,For science
Andrew,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Andrew,Yes. Go upto attractive women and ask them if they are religious
Andrew,Then ask for their number
Andrew,I told you about that movie thing right
Andrew,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Andrew,No
Andrew,
Andrew,Tell us
Andrew,oh well one of my buds from West was like hey do you want to go to a movie with me and some other people
Andrew,like its only him and girls at first so he invited me
Andrew,and I was like aight I hadn't hung out with him for a while so I went
Andrew,he was like oh yeah so I'm pretty sure one of the girls likes me so i was basically the wingman
Andrew,Yoda noises intensify
Andrew,I was walking in to the movies with him and the girl that liked him and she asked if I thought one of her friends was cute and I didn't wanna be rude and be like nah
Andrew,and I mean she kinda was
Andrew,so I was like yeah I guess
Andrew,and she was like oh well she thinks you're cute too
Andrew,and its funny cause I knew this girl when I went to school with her and we hadn't really talked a whole lot but now that i don't go there anymore she thinks I'm cute? okay then
Andrew,jed is only cute when you don't see him everyday
Andrew,but basically the rest of the time was them trying to get us together but I wasn't really tryna mess around
Andrew,also side note truth or dare is the worst movie of 2018
Andrew,but I was a successful wingman 
Andrew,"That feeling is called ""saudade"". It's a word only existant in portuguese, it is ""the wistful longing for something you no longer have""."
Andrew,i think
Andrew,dont quote me
Andrew,lmao
Andrew,I almost sent it though but I think the only reason I didn't is cause I asked a girl out earlier that day and the response was a maybe but leaning towards yes
Andrew,so friday was a weird day for me
Andrew,What the heck man
Andrew,Jed gettin all kinds of ladies
Andrew,Fellas is it gay to date a lady?
Andrew,^
Andrew,I mean you are literally going out with someone who sucks dick

Andrew,@Rivals of Aether lets do a tournament sometime 
Andrew,@Trapezoider check your snap
Andrew,Can someone help me with a thing on transformations of graphs
Andrew,
Andrew,Like I don't get what they want
Andrew,g(x)=-7f(x) or f(x)=-7g(x) I would think
Andrew,My problems are usually not in terms of f(x) and g(x) so I'm not sure which one goes where
Andrew,but reflecting a graph makes the function negative
Andrew,and stretching by a factor of 7 means multiply by 7
Andrew,Can you show the functions represented by f(x) and g(x)?
Andrew,Just tryna figure out where to input that information
Andrew,No they don't show me the graphs :(
Andrew,Did my suggestion not work?
Andrew,I'm going to bed now but good luck.
Andrew,@Trapezoider whenever you get a chance to look at it I shared it with you so just put comments where you have them
Andrew,You don't need to know what f(x) or g(x) are
Andrew,I don't remember exactly how it works but I'm pretty sure you want something like g(x) = -f(1/7 x)
Andrew,cause the negative gives you the vertical flip and the 1/7 x gives you the horizontal stretch
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,Yes they worked
Andrew,boo in my high school we wouldn't have gotten marks for cheesing a horizontal stretch as a vertical one
Andrew,My dad shutoff my fucking internet
Andrew,riiiiip
Andrew,Fuck that guy
Andrew,I'm 17 and you tryna give me a bed time

Andrew,doc are you gonna be back in frostbite now that exams are over?
Andrew,I've been here all week 
Andrew,I havent seen you 
Andrew,I just wasn't in the mood for any csgo
Andrew,

Andrew,i miss you dad
Andrew,"i got those airline tickets and ZACK
 is getting busfare soon"
Andrew,*zack
Andrew,fuck
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,Nice
Andrew,My parents would like to know if you buy tickets
Andrew,I buy not tickets yet
Andrew,Nice
Andrew,lol
Andrew,Did you even read what Max said @Trapezoider
Andrew,I was mocking him
Andrew,wait what did he say
Andrew,Did he fix it
Andrew,it doesnt say edited
Andrew,Hello
Andrew,If I say my message aloud it sounds perfectly fine
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,tense is a bit weird
Andrew,My parents
Andrew,"should be bought tickets, not buy tickets"
Andrew,you can't read that and say that it was fine
Andrew,Woud like to know
Andrew,If you buy tickets
Andrew,"but I know he has not yet, hence bought doesn't work"
Andrew,no
Andrew,because he hasnt yet
Andrew,So they would like to know when he has
Andrew,ok it could also be will buy
Andrew,no it is do buy
Andrew,using present tense doesn't work unless you're asking if that's what he is doing right now
Andrew,or what he does in general
Andrew,Holy fuck
Andrew,Stop
Andrew,"What do you for a living?
I buy tickets"
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,Have you bought tickets?
Andrew,he was talking future tense
Andrew,"""My parents would like to know if you buy tickets (some time in the future)"""
Andrew,it makes sense
Andrew,except that 'you buy' is present tense
Andrew,its not
Andrew,ok
Andrew,what is the present tense of 'to buy' then
Andrew,How about; if you are going to buy tickets
Andrew,but that isn't what they want to know
Andrew,yeah they want to know when(if) it happens
Andrew,then you guys are just asking the wrong question
Andrew,Then why would you use present tense?
Andrew,"you should just ask ""are you going to buy tickets"""
Andrew,that isn't the question either
Andrew,no thats not it
Andrew,literally don't even care
Andrew,when are you going to buy tickets
Andrew,he wanted to know when he buys tickets if he does
Andrew,tell him after it happens
Andrew,waezsxrdtcfvygubhnj
Andrew,"then ask: are you going to buy tickets? if so, when? also, let us know when you do"
Andrew,because the original question did not communicate that
Andrew,thats over complicated
Andrew,it's clear though
Andrew,I UNDERSTOOD YOU GUYS ARE DUM B
Andrew,THATS SOUNDS SO FORMAL
Andrew,"Try it like this ""My parents would like to know if you die"""
Andrew,same thing different words
Andrew,The first question you asked did not communicate any of that information
Andrew,it totally did
Andrew,yeah but that's not how languages work because language is dumb
Andrew,most verbs having to do with the state of a person have slightly different rules
Andrew,I'm going to delete the message and leave this server if you guys don't shut up
Andrew,it matters so little
Andrew,omg
Andrew,calm down
Andrew,you understood what I meant
Andrew,we didn't though
Andrew,the end result would be that doctor would alert me if he purchased tickets
Andrew,mission accomplished
Andrew,*shrugs* 'spose
Andrew,side question: am I alone in enjoying breaking down language and weird specifics of stuff? or is it just that I spent enough time having stuff beaten into my head while learning french that I've developed stockholm syndrome?
Andrew,I find it to be very boring
Andrew,It can be sometimes interesting
Andrew,like in what just happened
Andrew,I like comparing languages but being a grammar nazi isn't fun
Andrew,I think it's neat

Andrew,Pls
Andrew,What does that even mean? @Trapezoider
Andrew,Huh
Andrew,Oh wow I actually wrote that
Andrew,I thought that was part of the dream
Andrew,Huh
Andrew,Don't worry about it brother
Andrew,haha what 
Andrew,I had a dream I was messaging you guys in discord last night while trying to make an important life decision
Andrew,Turns out I actually messaged you because I wasn't asleep yet :(
Andrew,
Andrew,I'm glad I fell asleep before the dream happened :) shit got real
Andrew,This is so confusing
Andrew,what was the decision?
Andrew,Weather or not to do it to em boys
Andrew,
Andrew,How else would the dream had happened? Dreams only happen when you sleep.
Andrew,That's untrue
Andrew,Not if you're on drugs
Andrew,I guess when you space out
Andrew,Ever heard of daydreaming
Andrew,but you're technically not asleep
Andrew,...that's the point
Andrew,"even if you daydream, you're not alseep, so you're not technically dreaming. You're actually deep in thought"
Andrew,"yes, but your brain patterns 'n stuff are often closer to when you're falling asleep than when you're awake"
Andrew,it's kind of an in-between state
Andrew,take it from me who day dreams alot and has had some pretty messed up dreams in my life.
Andrew,"BTW, while we're on the subject, have any of you guys tried to Lucid Dream?"
Andrew,never actively tried but it happens every now and then
Andrew,I am trying to master it so I can work during the night
Andrew,I have. It's BEYOND trippy!
Andrew,If I can lucid dream I can practice piano while I sleep etc
Andrew,Even though I actually didn't try. My mind wouldn't settle down for some reason.
Andrew,"Towards the end I actually got a little scared cause I was like, ""How do I wake up?!"""
Andrew,Are you sure practicing piano in a dream would translate to real life??
Andrew,Just form a cliff
Andrew,Then jump off
Andrew,weirdly it actually would
Andrew,wild
Andrew,cause you're training all the same bits of your brain that are holding the muscle memory
Andrew,I think it would work
Andrew,same patterns of brain activation
Andrew,"I've heard if you die in a dream, there's a chance you could die in real life. Not know how true that is tho"
Andrew,"probably not as well, but it could help"
Andrew,also no that's 100% bullshit
Andrew,thats not true
Andrew,That's what I thought
Andrew,well technically you could but it's the same chance as dying at any other point of your life
Andrew,you're stupid
Andrew,"Well maybe something could happen to your brain if you die in a dream, but that might not be true either."
Andrew,You're brain doesn't function that way
Andrew,It would have to produce a neurotransmitter which is toxic and produce it in high enough doses
Andrew,"Well sorry, I'm not an expert on the brain functions!"
Andrew,But the brain doesn't and wouldn't do that
Andrew,wow neurotransmitter! That's a big word for you 
Andrew,the placebo effect is strong but we're damn good at not tricking ourselves into dying
Andrew,^^^
Andrew,maybe it is for you but not for him
Andrew,not everyone's retarded
Andrew,"true... but I'm not, neither is he or you"
Andrew,I don't know. None of us know you well enough to confirm or deny that. Except max and Ava

Andrew,he picked me up cause apperently I beat a Kragg who is supposedly good
Andrew,so I'm reading a javascript textbook
Andrew,"""Every now and then, usually between eight and ten in the evening, Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail."""
Andrew,what
Andrew,"later on in the same chapter,

""For a few years, things go great for Jacques. But at some point he loses his job. Because he lives in a nasty country where having no job means having no medical services, he is forced to take employment with a circus where he performs as The Incredible Squirrelman, stuffing his mouth with peanut butter before every show.

One day, fed up with this pitiful existence, Jacques fails to change back into his human form, hops through a crack in the circus tent, and vanishes into the forest. He is never seen again."""
Andrew,Why would this be in a java textbook?
Andrew,Yeah what the hell
Andrew,it was to set up the premise for data for a series of examples
Andrew,"also, javascript, not java"
Andrew,different languages
Andrew,Would that make this any less weird?

Andrew,redux
Andrew,he wants me to make a website with it
Andrew,and technically he's my boss
Andrew,so that's what I'm doing
Andrew,wait so you got an internship with your brother as your boss lol
Andrew,yup
Andrew,"nepotism, bitch"
Andrew,wait so how are you planning to learn it react is pretty small but an not sure about redux
Andrew,tons of massive ass tutorials
Andrew,practice
Andrew,what was that game
Andrew,n0ne is a lunatic
Andrew,that was way closer than it had any right to be
Andrew,if he hadn't thrown away that ganon stock he could have won that
Andrew,that recovery vs scorp tho
Andrew,yeah that was unbelievable
Andrew,was actually insane
Andrew,I've never seen falcon recovery like that
Andrew,imo n0ne is best at falcon recovery
Andrew,god n0ne is the fucking best
Andrew,wizzy is best at everything else
Andrew,but sucks at recovery
Andrew,s2j is just bad

Andrew,zack I asked her to go ice skating
Andrew,This is the moment of truth Br0THER
Andrew,did you ask her over text
Andrew,I asked her on our run this morning when  she came over
Andrew,and she said
Andrew,She would consult other tentative plans. And would provide and answer around this time. Lookin like a fat no
Andrew,"also, you guys have indoor rinks? didn't occur to me that the states would have that"
Andrew,Hell yeah. There are like 2 nearby ish
Andrew,r
Andrew,i
Andrew,p
Andrew,F
Andrew,F
Andrew,"@Trapezoider  most likely if she said she'd concult plans it means she's not interested. (Or maybe she is, but most likely not...)"
Andrew,or maybe she just doesn't like skating
Andrew,we gotta stay optimistic
Andrew,I'm with Zack
Andrew,I guess...
Andrew,I feel like skating isn't all that popular in the states
Andrew,I tried ice skating this one time and I sucked at it.
Andrew,fell on my butt like 20 times
Andrew,yeah that's skating at first
Andrew,still easier than snowboarding
Andrew,first time I tried I spent more time on the ground than on my feet
Andrew,but in general skating ignores a lot of the things you instinctively do to stay balanced
Andrew,cause you can't brace yourself except sideways
Andrew,that was the same with me. The only time I was actually standing was when I was hugging the wall.
Andrew,skating takes time
Andrew,only reason I'm any good is cause canada
Andrew,lots of practice
Andrew,Though I'd much rather roll skate than ice skate.
Andrew,shudders
Andrew,I don't like how hard it is to stop on roller skates
Andrew,"stopping on roller skates is tough, but you can at least STAND on them."
Andrew,it's a skill on skates -_-
Andrew,its something you have to learn
Andrew,but at least I know that if I'm out of control I can stop quickly
Andrew,F

Andrew,I just watched the end of the last mafia and chillin threw so hard
Andrew,he had it in the bag
Andrew,and he fucked up right at the end
Andrew,"also this is getting me to want to try some mafia, who'd be down to play?"
Andrew,me
Andrew,As am I
Andrew,how many people do we need to get a proper game going?
Andrew,I think somewhere in the realm of 12-14
Andrew,"google says you need at least 7, 2 mafia vs 5 town"
Andrew,today won't work for me though because I have 3 finals tomorrow
Andrew,I think 2 vs 5 is for speed mafia without the medic cop and vigilante
Andrew,I can't for the next 12 days
Andrew,I mean I think you need some town roles
Andrew,I feel like doing 2 mafia 4 town 1 cop would be best
Andrew,Yo what about the doctor tho
Andrew,eh less important imo
Andrew,Let's do it when Chris gets back
Andrew,Astralis got 3-0'd last night :(

Andrew,I don't think Zain has ever beaten m2k
Andrew,didn't he in pools? or was that 3-2 m2k
Andrew,m2k won 3-2
Andrew,and he won every game in the marth ditto and 3-0ed him in a marth ditto a few tourneys ago

Andrew,possibly not tonight
Andrew,probably not tonight

Andrew,I think the best absa

Andrew,WOOOOO
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,lets play skullgirls
Andrew,alright
Andrew,let me go get my controller cable and refil my coffee
Andrew,5 mins
Andrew,andrew did you lean any combos?
Andrew,"if not, max should probably play not his main"
Andrew,@The Rona
Andrew,buy your texas tickets big gay
Andrew,!zack
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,how do you break out of combos
Andrew,This game is hard
Andrew,@everyone
Andrew,Let's have a skill girls tournament on Saturday
Andrew,I mean you don't break out of combos
Andrew,but if you see this weird smoke stuff you can hit any button to burst
Andrew,but htat only happens if the other person repeats the same thing too many times in the same combo
Andrew,"and if me or max is comboing you, we've learned combos that don't let you break out"
Andrew,
Andrew,"but generally, it's not optimal to do the full combo unless it's gonna kill"
Andrew,cause the longer the combo the less any individual hit does
Andrew,"you ideally want to combo someone a bit, then trick them and start a new combo with fresh damage scaling"
Andrew,but neither me nor max is good enough to do that yet
Andrew,"also, max, did you go fukua against him? that wasn't very nice of you lol"
Andrew,I only remember half the combo
Andrew,I know next to nothing about any other character and didn't feel like figuring it out
Andrew,@Trapezoider I'll be down for games in like an hour and a half
Andrew,Hell yeah
Andrew,Going to the gym will play games when I return

Andrew,"also, the nearest in & out is an hour and a half walk away and I'm salty"
Andrew,I might do it anyway
Andrew,Welcome to America!
Andrew,guys your roads are so nice
Andrew,True
Andrew,"If you come to the meetup you can see the widest highway in the entire world. The Katy Freeway, which is something like 16 lanes."
Andrew,Depends where tho
Andrew,"I mean it's more just like, they're hella smooth"
Andrew,cause there aren't proper winters here
Andrew,so you don't get tons of potholes
Andrew,I'm not used to this
Andrew,Warm climate>cold climate
Andrew,"on the flip side, it's about a million degrees in my room"
Andrew,and there's no AC
Andrew,lemme add 'fan' to my shopping list
Andrew,good idea
Andrew,"once I unpacked my computer, the first thing I looked up was the nearest in and out, and the second thing was making sure the tap water is drinkable"
Andrew,"priorities, motherfuckers"
Andrew,"tap water: safe to drink
tap water: tastes kinda bad"
Andrew,"also, your paper money sucks"

Andrew,is kfc a better bet?
Andrew,they're both meh imo
Andrew,but which one is more meh

Andrew,choose based on that
Andrew,I mean I don't really care one way or the other?
Andrew,dammit I'm trying to get you guys to make up my mind
Andrew,choose jack in the box

Andrew,Every country in the entire world?
Andrew,This has nothing to do with history
Andrew,Yes all 206 or whatever
Andrew,wow
Andrew,He is just a horrible teacher who doesn't want to teach or grade anything
Andrew,At least you didn't have to put a certain number of dots on each country based off it's population
Andrew,That was fun
Andrew,Damn
Andrew,Oh Christ
Andrew,Why is the education system so retarded
Andrew,Nah it's just this teacher really
Andrew,But I mean yeah
Andrew,He doesn't even give tests it's always projects
Andrew,Because we don't learn anything
Andrew,good ol education system

Andrew,@Homies do you guys wanna have a melee tournament where Zack and max can't play their mains or secondaries?
Andrew,I'm down
Andrew,I guess so
Andrew,"Honestly, depending on skill level, you may need to ban 15+ characters"
Andrew,for us
Andrew,we could do it like we used to do rivals tournaments
Andrew,we should do it like rivals where each person gets a certain number of bans
Andrew,based on skill
Andrew,great minds think alike
Andrew,^
Andrew,maybe I could even rope in Ava for one more
Andrew,lets try and do it tonight
Andrew,so do we have 4 so far?
Andrew,we could maybe get up to 6
Andrew,I'm curious what my ping's gonna be like to everyone
Andrew,I think we'll have to except that some people will have awful ping
Andrew,I'll have great ping to andrew for once
Andrew,I have fine ping to the shapes so we should be okay
Andrew,and jed
Andrew,"also, do you want to play a bit in like an hour? I want to get a little more done but then I want a break"
Andrew,I'm down

Andrew,what is this?
Andrew,Were gonna do a character crew battle

Andrew,@cs 1 game ?
Andrew,@Zain  ?>
Andrew,@Max is thing happen tonight?
Andrew,no
Andrew,Jed isn't here
Andrew,"@Sak von Sak  Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you been watching the Persona 5 Animation? If you are, how are you enjoying it?"
Andrew,it's.... mediocre
Andrew,it gets the broad strokes
Andrew,but the pacing's wack
Andrew,really?
Andrew,and it's skipped a lot of little important character moments
Andrew,it's missing a lot of the charm the game had
Andrew,"Well I mean, trying to crame moments into a 30 minute episode and 24 of them, I can see how the pacing can be off."
Andrew,"I only saw one episode, the battle against Kamoshida (the first boss)."
Andrew,I mean it's not horrible
Andrew,but you'd be better off playing the game
Andrew,my biggest problem is they keep cutting good character building moments
Andrew,and it's persona
Andrew,you can't just skip the character building
Andrew,and the back-and-forth and stuff that builds the characters into a group with dynamics and stuff rather than just a bunch of characters shoved together
Andrew,"also the protag is both a) bland as fuck, and b) practically non-existant as a character"
Andrew,"I know they're running him from a silent protagonist in the game, but even in-game they gave him a lot more character than this"
Andrew,"like, watch the p4 anime if you want to see a persona protag handled well"
Andrew,"or even the p3 movies, although he's kind of an emo little shit, but at least that's actually a personality"
Andrew,sorry

Andrew,Meetup
Andrew,
Andrew,Hey it's like frostbites 3 years anniversary
Andrew,Ah
Andrew,how do you know
Andrew,Because I met you guys for the tf2 team 3 years ago
Andrew,frostbite is a bit older than you knowing them is
Andrew,frostbite was actually a bit later
Andrew,but the core group was earlier
Andrew,I wasn't even part of the original core group
Andrew,the original team where we all met was called frostbite
Andrew,thats where the name came from
Andrew,I joined like... two and a half years ago?
Andrew,oh huh
Andrew,"so it was frostbite, then not frostbite, then frostbite again?"
Andrew,yes
Andrew,Frostbite>Pancake Pals>POOP>Rolo Regiment>Frostbite
Andrew,I've known you guys for 3 years is what I was saying
Andrew,It's my anniversary of knowing you guys
Andrew,POOP?
Andrew,POOP
Andrew,is that an acronym?
Andrew,People Order Our Patties
Andrew,o h
Andrew,I voted against it
Andrew,its funny
Andrew,that team was made of spongebob references
Andrew,Man we've had a lot of good times
Andrew,RIP frostbite gamers
Andrew,"unrelated, but I had a dream last night that my friend (in the dream, now that I'm awake I have no idea who he was) got turned into a giant monster cause he fell into a pool of red bull and the army was after him so me and some other people took him and ran away to australia where we just kinda chilled in a hotel room and threw cookies at each other"
Andrew,"also unrelated, to both the previous conversation and my previous thing, I found the best twitter: it's a bot that scrapes github for people committing stuff with swearing in it and posts them. It scratches two great itches of 1) relating to salty programmers, and 2) hilarious mixing of professional, technical writing with swearing"
Andrew,for example: https://twitter.com/gitlost/status/996784597194170369
Andrew,I MADE THIS SHIT TO WORK ASYNCHRONOUSLY WITH SMALL DELAYS
Andrew,Make a film off of that dream please

Andrew,The first frostbite discord post
Andrew,Actually I feel like that's wrong my discord might be lying to me
Andrew,Holy crap
Andrew,My guy how long did you scroll
Andrew,Lol
Andrew,Remember when we used mumble
Andrew,Doctors mumble server
Andrew,No it was kamerons
Andrew,:0
Andrew,Cause it was mumble tf2
Andrew,my first tf2 team still has a facebook page and it's mad nostalgic
Andrew,
Andrew,am just an overwatch scrub lol
Andrew,I'm scrolling back through now and I found the best picture I've ever taken
Andrew,Yo everyone keep sending old screenshots on getting so much nostalgia
Andrew,
Andrew,This is the beginning of my server
Andrew,what about the OG frostbite?
Andrew,I left that server :0
Andrew,Why
Andrew,@Bitmin
Andrew,esea
Andrew,im only back now and a bit later
Andrew,That was a good nostalgia trip
Andrew,^
Andrew,Man I remember mumble
Andrew,I honestly dont really remember mumble
Andrew,discord is so much better
Andrew,I remember I hated discord whnr it came out
Andrew,Mumbles interface was terrible
Andrew,Discord is a huge step up
Andrew,I don't know how we used it for so long
Andrew,"If we've known Trap for 3 years, does that mean we've known each other for 4? @Max @Mr. Airplane"
Andrew,"no, its been 3 years for us"
Andrew,around 2 and a half for him
Andrew,@The Rona
Andrew,September 25 is the earliest thing I can find in Monday night super slammed whatever
Andrew,Of 2015
Andrew,Kameron Chris and I were on a team before that
Andrew,it formed in May 2015
Andrew,^
Andrew,
Andrew,I joined early 2016 if I remember correctly
Andrew,Chikon nd the cock fighters right
Andrew,Or rolo regiment
Andrew,Right?
Andrew,rolo regiment
Andrew,not even the weirdest team name I've played for
Andrew,that probably goes to 'It's Raining Minh'
Andrew,HA
Andrew,Was the leader Chinese?
Andrew,not even
Andrew,the story goes a little like this:
Andrew,"there was a team, with some normal name"
Andrew,their medic was this guy who went by minh
Andrew,and they had some weird in-joke about 'minh advantage'
Andrew,"eventually, said team disbanded, and a few people got together to make a new team, which was called minh advantage"
Andrew,"that team also broke up, and a new subset of that team, containing a few people from the original team whose name I don't remember, made another new team, minh advantage II"
Andrew,which is when I joined
Andrew,"then there was some upheaval with a patch that messed with demo and heavy a bit and like, half the team quit"
Andrew,"it was then patched up with some teammates from my first tf2 team and some tryouts, and rechristened It's Raining Minh"
Andrew,and we went on to make playoffs
Andrew,and then disband
Andrew,You should make a movie out of that
Andrew,I'm now wondering if some people from it's raining minh went on to make another team with a name containing minh
Andrew,"also, as It's Raining Minh our team tag was a little umbrella that is for some reason an accepted unicode character"
Andrew,@Melee anyone want to play for a bit?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,I can't talk tho
Andrew,k
Andrew,@Melee I am unsatiated

Andrew,"@Sak von Sak  I got a Persona 5 question, since you're the wizard at this stuff. Someone I watch on Youtube was describing anime characters in 4 seconds and someone gave him Morgana and he said ""IT'S TIME TO GO TO FREAKIN' SLEEP!"" how does that describe Morgana?"
Andrew,@Bitmin wanna csgo?
Andrew,Oh jeez I have not slept in a couple day but I'll play 1 game give me a couple mins
Andrew,oh ok
Andrew,pfffft yeah
Andrew,it's a meme
Andrew,that you probably won't experience in the show
Andrew,"but basically at the end of days in-game, sometimes based on events during the day you can't go out or anything, but the game still gives you some control over your character"
Andrew,but if you try to leave
Andrew,Morgana: You look tired. You should get some sleep.
Andrew,it's an integral part of the p5 experience

Andrew,@Weeb
Andrew,so my hero academia is a good show
Andrew,nice
Andrew,"I won't deny that, it's just personally doesn't appeal to me."
Andrew,yee that show's awesome
Andrew,how far in are you?
Andrew,4 episodes
Andrew,I watched it this morning
Andrew,I may be sleep deprived but I teared up a little bit 
Andrew,I think I'm gay 
Andrew,Crying as a man doesn't mean you're gay
Andrew,but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
Andrew,
Andrew,who said I'm gay?
Andrew,literally nobody
Andrew,^ we were talking about me
Andrew,"well when he said
but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
after my comment, I thought he was talking about me"
Andrew,Nah he's saying I'm gay
Andrew,
Andrew,"well like I said, crying as a man doesn't mean your gay."
Andrew,you are of hte gay andrew
Andrew,Snap
Andrew,I thought I liked girls
Andrew,"In fact, it shows that you're a true man as true men know how to express their feelings"
Andrew,^^^ true brother
Andrew,"and besides, you're not gay in my book unless you're making out with dudes."
Andrew,bruh i feel like you can still make out with dudes and not be gay
Andrew,aslong as your socks are on
Andrew,"if you were forced, maybe."
Andrew,"like if my LIFE or something VERY precious to me was on the line, I'd probably do it. But otherwise, nuh uh!"
Andrew,Compelled homosexuality
Andrew,like if some dude came up to me  and offered me $20 to make out with him id probably do it so i see where you're coming from mrd256
Andrew,"I wouldn't do it for $20, unless I was desperate."
Andrew,i am
Andrew,you're broke then
Andrew,College
Andrew,"eh, makes sense"
Andrew,"I could get two extra large pepperoni pizzas for $20

I would give a guy a quick peck on the lips for two extra large pepperoni pizzas, especially in this situation where there's clearly no expectations of anything beyond that. I'm not desperate or broke, I just really like pizza."
Andrew,with $20 i can buy literally 60 packs of ramen
Andrew,thats lunch for 2 months
Andrew,ramen in America is unhealthy you now that.
Andrew,"like, extremely"
Andrew,clearly you don't understand university living
Andrew,it's far more healthy to eat ramen every day for lunch
Andrew,than to not eat lunch
Andrew,^
Andrew,fucking
Andrew,preach
Andrew,"Well I'm not in collage or live by my self yet, so maybe it don't."
Andrew,but the pizzas though
Andrew,"And while ramen is not good for you, it is better than not eating anything. Doesn't make it healthier tho"
Andrew,at the end of the day I think it comes down to priorities: there's not much on that level of harmlessness that I wouldn't do for $20
Andrew,"Listen, $20 is $20"
Andrew,^
Andrew,@Cs:go gamezzzzzzzz
Andrew,Ya boi sold his car
Andrew,Firebird incoming
Andrew,Prolly

Andrew,
Andrew,Well the Firebirds are also 20+ years old
Andrew,"but are high performance sports cars designed for optimal control and speed balance. Im so excited for you though, youre going to be boolin   and impressin all kinds of ladies"

Andrew,"@Zack  So I was playing Persona 5 and I think I noticed an animation error in one of the cutscenes. This is the beach scene. Yusuke holds up his hands like he's trying to picture something in the next shot his hands are like backwards? Thought you might find this interesting.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449728861484220416/unknown.png
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449729119408619551/unknown.png"
Andrew,lol I never noticed that
Andrew,probably just a laziness thing
Andrew,I was probably a little too busy cracking up at the towel thing
Andrew,"It's just something funny that caught my eye.
Yeah, the towel thing was funny too."
Andrew,"Tho one of the highlights for me in this scene, was the protagonist actually speaking an actual line. Just based on his battle quotes, I think they choose a great english VA for him, but he doesn't speak enough, even during battle."
Andrew,"If there is a Persona 5 animation dub, I'd watch it just to hear his VA in full."
Andrew,Xander Mobus
Andrew,he's the announcer guy for sm4sh
Andrew,and they picked him for basically just yelling names again
Andrew,good pick
Andrew,honestly the english cast for p5 is all damn good except maybe haru
Andrew,"yeah, I think his voice fits him."
Andrew,Haru... eh she's okay.
Andrew,her voice was annoying at first but it grew on me
Andrew,that's kinda the way it is will all really high-pitched girls
Andrew,eh not always
Andrew,but yeah pretty often
Andrew,"Honestly, I wasn't too big a fan of Makoto's VA. Not that she was a bad actress, but the fact that her voice didn't really suit her. But that's me"
Andrew,I am incredibly biased towards her voice actress because she's done a ton of roles I've loved
Andrew,so I felt like it worked
Andrew,but that might just be me
Andrew,But the one VA I like out of them all is Morgana's. Cassandra Morris is one of my most favorite dub voice actresses
Andrew,She had me terrified
Andrew,you can't put kyubey's voice in a cutesy animal sidekick
Andrew,you just can't do that
Andrew,that's not ok
Andrew,"Well, I don't really know who Kyubey is... but I like her because of some other roles she's done."
Andrew,"And Morgana is not a ""Cutesy"" animal sidekick!"
Andrew,"@ anyone who's watched madoka magica, confirm that you would be scared to hear his voice coming out of any cutesy animal sidekick"
Andrew,"also, aesthetically, definitely cutesy"
Andrew,"personality-wise, not as much"
Andrew,I'll give you that
Andrew,"also, you've finished p4, right?"
Andrew,"I didn't play it, but I've watched the anime. But I did finish the anime"
Andrew,"for p4, I correctly predicted the villain by their voice actor, cause I was like 'there is no way they would hire a voice actor this good at sounding badass and evil and give him to that derpy a character.'"
Andrew,so I was never not suspicious of morgana
Andrew,I'm not telling you if I was right or not
Andrew,but I was scared from start to finish
Andrew,"Most of the roles I know Morgana's VA from are all protagonist characters or sub characters. Nothing evil about them. Also, she was in p4's anime"
Andrew,p4 had the weirdest voice cast
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane show us your graduation pics or it's fake
Andrew,"50% amazing, 50% terrible"
Andrew,"Yeah, the only VAs I liked in p4 were Yu, Yosuke, Kanji, and Rise"
Andrew,that would pretty much be their big-name voice actors in the main cast
Andrew,yep
Andrew,"Johnny Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker/Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey"
Andrew,and then a bunch of mediocre people
Andrew,and then some big names for tiny roles
Andrew,that pretty much sums it up
Andrew,"p5 has the best overall cast, p3 had a solid one with a few big problems"
Andrew,it starts off so strong
Andrew,"Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Vic Mignogna, Tara Platt, Liam O'Brian"
Andrew,and then Fuuka shows up
Andrew,heh
Andrew,I didn't know Michelle Ruff and Liam O'Brian were in p3. Did Michelle voice Yukari?
Andrew,"yeah, and Liam O'Brian did Akihiko"
Andrew,Ah! I was thinking Akihiko was Josh Grelle.
Andrew,"and Yukari is possibly my favorite Persona girl so far.
and my favorite Persona character period is possibly Akechi from p5"
Andrew,"I Really like that sadistic and psychotic type of villian, especially where they look so innocent to begin with."
Andrew,I always kinda figured he was gonna turn out evil
Andrew,I just didn't realize... how evil
Andrew,when he snaps he snaps
Andrew,and his voice actor does an amazing job of it too
Andrew,"He was like one of the main antagonists, next to Shido and the final boss"
Andrew,yeah he does
Andrew,and he was definitely the most interesting antagonist
Andrew,true that

Andrew,Sorry about to play a game of civ 5
Andrew,training session?
Andrew,DO YOU MEAN
Andrew,MELEE
Andrew,ill play
Andrew,melee isnt fun with such high ping because high ping buffs you as a player and nerfs me. I will fight you when I am in texas and our ping is better
Andrew,honestly high ping usually hurts the stronger player
Andrew,"you can't combo as hard, or be as precise in neutral"
Andrew,"no johns, andrew"
Andrew,@Trapezoider Civ game isn't happening I can play now
Andrew,youre wrong in this case zack
Andrew,Kameron has no movement ability and little tech skill
Andrew,he still has combos and neutral
Andrew,My playstyle revolves around getting grabs and spacing around my opponent
Andrew,which are far more affected
Andrew,When I have 120 ping
Andrew,"@Sak von Sak When your entire punish game is being good at tech chasing, high ping hurts a lot"
Andrew,wavedashing because impossible
Andrew,I guess
Andrew,which is the case for trap
Andrew,"also wavedashing and most tech is muscle memory, ping shouldn't matter"
Andrew,It does matter because it changes the timing
Andrew,Milliseconds matter
Andrew,"a wavedash is the same input, you just have to do it ever so slightly earlier"
Andrew,no different than any other input

Andrew,It would be awesome if we could get that many teams
Andrew,50 50 split would be more fun imo
Andrew,nah
Andrew,We shall vote
Andrew,then it would all end in 1 fight
Andrew,good point
Andrew,"with smaller teams, the fights will be more spread out"
Andrew,but if someone dies super early thats so lame
Andrew,and 2v1 comebacks are much more possible than like 2v6
Andrew,They can spectate
Andrew,pvp gives me depression
Andrew,that's sometimes almost as fun as playing
Andrew,no it aint
Andrew,We will be having a grace period
Andrew,everyone will be safe for some amount of time
Andrew,trap team with me pls
Andrew,@Trapezoider
Andrew,@Trapezoider I'll need to go over some standard rules to prevent stalling before we play
Andrew,ye youre my team
Andrew,aavaaa
Andrew,Max make the rules and put them in the Realm channel
Andrew,someone stop letting max make the rules
Andrew,no mining?
Andrew,tf?
Andrew,These are standard rules
Andrew,without them it is impossible to find anyone
Andrew,no Branch minding Devin!
Andrew,All major UHC games follow that rule
Andrew,wow you're supposed to be my main man matt but you dont even know how to spell my name
Andrew,"first of all, I'm not your bud.
second, is it Kevin or Devin? you keep changing it"
Andrew,first of all
Andrew,i am your bud
Andrew,second of all
Andrew,kevin is my persona my irl name has always been Devon
Andrew,no one likes u kevn
Andrew,
Andrew,"@Max  I say Nether should be allowed, but only for Blaze Rods."
Andrew,also... I'm not sure about enchanting
Andrew,The point of banning the nether is so you can't hide in it
Andrew,agree no nether
Andrew,hmm that's a good point.
Andrew,I would like no enchanting
Andrew,"Also, is this team based or no?"
Andrew,@Trapezoider hey fucker
Andrew,"The reason for the nether, diamond, and enchantment bans is to try and speed up the game by vastly reducing the amount of time people need to spend gathering resources."
Andrew,"Not sure if everyone wants this, but I think it would be more fun."
Andrew,is this team based or no?
Andrew,We are planning on having teams
Andrew,ok
Andrew,I say we have a grace period until the end of the first Minecraft day
Andrew,day or day and night?
Andrew,from sunrise Day 1 to sunrise day 2
Andrew,day and night
Andrew,I mean we could always just go off of the honour system to not hide
Andrew,there are some people on here I don't trust to do that
Andrew,Also we could say that after x amount of time we get teleported to spawn to finish so it doesn't last forever
Andrew,"Even with no hiding, by banning these things we will reduce the amount of time needed to acquire maximum strength gear"
Andrew,I trust everyone here
Andrew,points to Devin
Andrew,"That is my main reason, not to prevent hiding."
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,why did you hey fucker
Andrew,Whats up
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,can you take a break to join for the realms thing big guy?
Andrew,in like an hour
Andrew,I don't think he owns Minecraft
Andrew,really? I thought he was there last time we made a realm
Andrew,"I mean, I don't think banning things like diamonds and the nether are gonna be fun. I think you should be able to use whatever you find"
Andrew,at least allow diamonds
Andrew,We can discuss this in detail when we decide the final rules later.
Andrew,but then ppl will spend forever looking for them and thats boring
Andrew,^^^^
Andrew,"also, if we're doing custom terrain, we can lower diamond spawn rates making it harder to get them"
Andrew,That would lead to even more time farming though
Andrew,Not if you can't strip mine. People will have to leave their caves eventually
Andrew,
Andrew,I'm not for lowering the rates of ores
Andrew,Kinda lame
Andrew,only diamond
Andrew,just diamonds
Andrew,Still
Andrew,If anything make them more common
Andrew,Lowering diamonds makes others more common?
Andrew,"No, I mean make diamonds more common so you don't have to spend as long searching for them."
Andrew,but then everyone will have diamond gear
Andrew,so?
Andrew,well I guess that's fair kinda fair...
Andrew,makes fights last longer
Andrew,true
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,We could also give everyone 20 hearts with commands
Andrew,You guys want that?
Andrew,I like that
Andrew,ye
Andrew,Keep figuring this out and tell me what to do when we start
Andrew,Are we gonna have a world border?
Andrew,of course
Andrew,Can we do a shrinking border then?
Andrew,are we playing on the latest snap shot or 1.12?
Andrew,"@Trapezoider If you want this to go more smoothly, be sure to make me an OP on your new server"
Andrew,"can we make a rule that if someone dies randomly from falling they can come back to life, I feel like that is going to happen and it will be super lame"
Andrew,No
Andrew,That won't happen
Andrew,no
Andrew,it might
Andrew,Just don't die from fall damage
Andrew,Easy
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,^
Andrew,its no t
Andrew,just watch what you're doing at all times
Andrew,>.>
Andrew,I'm planning on having health regen on by the way
Andrew,Survival of the fittest mother fucker
Andrew,Having it off penalizes you for taking fights
Andrew,so are we playing in the latest snapshot or 1.12?
Andrew,I would say 1.12
Andrew,"well hold on, I want to check if 1.13 is out, I don't think it is... but I want to check"
Andrew,it is on pre-release
Andrew,will that do? or still on 1.12?
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,Whatever the realm allows for
Andrew,what time are we starting?
Andrew,After the Sony E3 event
Andrew,not sure when that is
Andrew,ask Andrew
Andrew,I'm just going to be here
Andrew,@Trapezoider  what time is Sony E3 over?
Andrew,idk
Andrew,im not watching it
Andrew,Can you declare a start time then? Otherwise it will be left ambiguous and it will never happen.
Andrew,Sony ends at 10 ish
Andrew,What time zone?

Andrew,Est
Andrew,so in about an hour

Andrew,"Kameron pulled a hunger games move, except he wasn't one of the last two people alive"
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,whats the zombie swarm mechanic?
Andrew,Hitting zombies spawns more zombies
Andrew,More smash 5 on stream
Andrew,That are aggro on you
Andrew,smash 5 stylistically looks much more developed than 4
Andrew,I agree
Andrew,The game looks good
Andrew,it looks visually complete
Andrew,this game suz
Andrew,Let's hope it feels good
Andrew,worse than maxs retard fort
Andrew,smash 4 just was missing some stuff visually
Andrew,so is this game
Andrew,:/
Andrew,Andrew how does this game look bad?
Andrew,It looks worse than jeds beard
Andrew,H
Andrew,O
Andrew,W
Andrew,F

Andrew,Thanks buddy
Andrew,I gotchu
Andrew,Who ever is playing pac man right now sucks real bad
Andrew,Yo what are the command seals in fate zero
Andrew,im confused
Andrew,They allow you to give your servant a command that they cannot refuse regardless of how they personally feel about the order
Andrew,HOw many times can you USE them
Andrew,3
Andrew,Ohhhh
Andrew,Why are they using items on this stream
Andrew,cause it's the casual stream

Andrew,Feelsbad
Andrew,f
Andrew,he said the devs are still making changes
Andrew,Maybe there is hope
Andrew,Feedback from melee players will hopefully help
Andrew,well I've lost all interest in this game
Andrew,knockback looks so wack
Andrew,you fly super far super fast and then just stop
Andrew,that's gonna mess with combos pretty hard I'm guessing
Andrew,"no ledge hog, no wave stuff, same top tier as smash 4, no  dash dance, resident sleeper"
Andrew,fingers crossed for it improving in the interm
Andrew,cause they'll probably get a lot of feedback from the competitive people who want some changes
Andrew,yes and nintendo will TOTALLY listen to that /s
Andrew,shhh let me live in my happy little bubble
Andrew,ok sorry
Andrew,this is pretty cringe
Andrew,I use that word sparingly
Andrew,"desk guy: ""everyone's hoping for that 7th map""
the entire chat: ""4-0 pls"""
Andrew,"If the numbers each character was given in the smash 5 trailer corresponds to the order they were created (which I think they said was the case), then the long held theory of roy and game and watch being created last and being incomplete has finally been confirmed."
Andrew,2-2 rip
Andrew,resident sleeper
Andrew,I'm reading reddit and people seem to think that ledge hogging in a game is bad and I honestly don't understand why
Andrew,it literally doubles the amount of ways that you can feasibly kill your opponent and thus makes the game more interesting and complex
Andrew,what's even the point of ledges if they don't do anything?
Andrew,it begins

Andrew,Where is it at

Andrew,Nintendo @ E3: Day 1
Andrew,lol already we've got mango chants
Andrew,crowd chanting mango
Andrew,mango chant
Andrew,lol
Andrew,we all thought the same thing
Andrew,were they not allowed to wear their team's jerseys?
Andrew,prolly not cause it's pure nintendo sponsored
Andrew,also why is vish's mic so quiet
Andrew,Vish's mic is broken I think
Andrew,I think we are hearing auditorium speaker audio through the other people's mics
Andrew,This better be 1v1s
Andrew,why wouldnt it be?
Andrew,oh well nevermind
Andrew,The smash 4 invitational was 4 player ffa
Andrew,this is actually a pretty neat format
Andrew,zero armada is probably a busted team tho
Andrew,not really
Andrew,They have the smash ball on
Andrew,I mean the bracket format
Andrew,^
Andrew,of dubs -> singles
Andrew,cringey announcer
Andrew,funnyskit tho
Andrew,I figured armada would pick pokemon trainer because he really likes ivysaur
Andrew,cheering for zero armada
Andrew,you can act out of airdodge
Andrew,it's got some lag tho
Andrew,that map was wack
Andrew,oh they play one map
Andrew,lol 2nd at evo 2017... someone's got their info wrong
Andrew,"2015, yes, 2017 no"
Andrew,unlucky
Andrew,bayo looks more reasonable now
Andrew,he stuff's got more knockback
Andrew,you know the slowmo prolly makes it really easy to di
Andrew,but you still CAN do the old combos but it's way harder
Andrew,hopefully you can turn slowmo off
Andrew,"also, while there's no lcancelling it looks like you've got way less landing lag on stuff"
Andrew,I might main bayo
Andrew,its a consideration
Andrew,They haven't even shown how each character plays yet
Andrew,My list of potential mains is rather long
Andrew,Just because they were good in smash 4 doesn't really mean they will continue to be good with all these new characters
Andrew,True beans
Andrew,there are only 2 new characters
Andrew,Still more characters than smash 4
Andrew,Things can change
Andrew,They only have access to 30 characters right now
Andrew,hbox v reggie again
Andrew,LETS GET SOME 1V1
Andrew,Random cosplayers?
Andrew,wutface
Andrew,Obese Ness lol
Andrew,they're all fat]
Andrew,Wtf
Andrew,Ness is sweatin'
Andrew,Lucky thought that game was a ffa match LOLOLOL
Andrew,He was attacking Mr. R on purpose
Andrew,derp
Andrew,wat
Andrew,the legend
Andrew,Lol
Andrew,zero's prolly got this in the bag
Andrew,Where's the Charizard
Andrew,pokemon trainer looks kinda neat tho
Andrew,I think if you work out the changes mid-combo 'n stuff you've got some tricks
Andrew,This doesn't look that good
Andrew,armada didn't really do anything with it tho
Andrew,also ike looks sick
Andrew,he's so fast
Andrew,F MangO
Andrew,mewtwo's sooo fast
Andrew,hot damn
Andrew,that was actually pretty good
Andrew,and they were using wavelands and stuff
Andrew,My man plup
Andrew,I have faith in this game being good
Andrew,is this genesis?
Andrew,Items 
Andrew,I mean yeah the items were a bit weird
Andrew,THAT AINT ZELDA
Andrew,but the standard play was legit
Andrew,It looked real nice
Andrew,I want to see the finals
Andrew,Snake vs Sheik
Andrew,sure the combos aren't stellar but it looks like it's got setups and such that you didn't have as much in sm4sh
Andrew,hopefully no items
Andrew,that was actually pretty hype at the end
Andrew,like you've got post-combo positioning setups that look real good
Andrew,WHY
Andrew,this is so pointless
Andrew,shhh
Andrew,it's pandering to hte casuals
Andrew,"Pointless, unless they bring out actual people"
Andrew,who are these people??
Andrew,Who are these people?
Andrew,Who TF???
Andrew,I mean there was an ign person
Andrew,but I dunno
Andrew,these are pretty meh vips
Andrew,just give me reggie vs hbox
Andrew,^
Andrew,Tfw they play DK crew song when a big black guy comes on stage 
Andrew,i know blacknerdcomedy has a youtube
Andrew,which is quite popular
Andrew,well  its already over
Andrew,that kyogre sweep lol
Andrew,I think Zelda and Sheik are the same character again
Andrew,they said no
Andrew,they showed up as different characters in the initial intro
Andrew,The girl's name is Zelda
Andrew,Not the character
Andrew,I see
Andrew,"remeber kids, Animal Crossing teaches you that Taxation is theft"
Andrew,sheik looks really fun
Andrew,COMBOS
Andrew,OMG
Andrew,yo that was nutty
Andrew,Sheik looks really fun
Andrew,That was insane
Andrew,they both look super fun
Andrew,Dang
Andrew,actual combos
Andrew,MKleo dropped the ball
Andrew,also snake's uptilt's the same lol
Andrew,i already said both those things max
Andrew,naw that was honestly all zero
Andrew,he's a sneaky bastard
Andrew,it's nuts
Andrew,The set up from snake in the beginning of the final stock
Andrew,This game looks dope
Andrew,wait is there rage?
Andrew,I actually want a switch now
Andrew,yeah :(
Andrew,rip
Andrew,if the game's this intense day 1 I'm looking forward to it
Andrew,rage is actually the most dumb mechanic
Andrew,like sure there's some clear similarities to sm4sh so people get a head start but still
Andrew,yeah rage is weird
Andrew,rage?
Andrew,"higher your %, more knockback"
Andrew,ah
Andrew,makes it super hard to kill when you're at low % and easy to make comebacks
Andrew,and also hard to combo low % people when you're at high %
Andrew,How did MKLeo all 3 of those characters
Andrew,I mean
Andrew,2 smash 4 top tiers and snake
Andrew,or it makes it easier to roll your opponent @Sak von Sak
Andrew,"it seems like it was gonna make heavies really good cause they can live to high percents and kill before other people get to high, but heavies still kinda sucked"
Andrew,yeah that too
Andrew,Bay Vs. Ride mhmmm
Andrew,wtf is that down B!?!
Andrew,wait wat
Andrew,how did he die at 17%
Andrew,items LOL
Andrew,lol
Andrew,lol bayo
Andrew,fuck
Andrew,Bayo needs to be nerfed
Andrew,she's back
Andrew,FML
Andrew,She looks kind of fun not gonna lie
Andrew,true
Andrew,she's just old dumb bayo
Andrew,gimme interesting bayo
Andrew,not the same combo
Andrew,although that might have been partially just ridley being huge
Andrew,^ yeah
Andrew,but sstill
Andrew,that was hella dumb
Andrew,bigger hitbox = easy combo
Andrew,still the fact that she can do that to anyone is depressing
Andrew,she is just dumb combo
Andrew,Hype best of 3
Andrew,maybe 2 sets
Andrew,tfw WWE super star and it is not John Cena
Andrew,oh hype spirit tracks music
Andrew,I think
Andrew,LOL WUT
Andrew,nairo with a bunch of scrubs?
Andrew,this is gonna be a slaughter
Andrew,Nairo about to destroy some noobs
Andrew,who allowed this
Andrew,lololol
Andrew,Secretly pro players
Andrew,he's still gonna slaughter em
Andrew,Lol
Andrew,3 v 1 
Andrew,3v1
Andrew,items and no team attack might swing it a bit
Andrew,this is great
Andrew,Can Nairo do it?
Andrew,no
Andrew,Nairo is about to get raped
Andrew,he can but it'll be tough
Andrew,items are good
Andrew,he's one of the best sm4sh players
Andrew,like the big three are zero mkleo and him
Andrew,SNAKE!?!
Andrew,also nairo's got a chance cause I think he just needs the most kills total
Andrew,the crowd is singing the DK RAP LOL
Andrew,i thought its was stocks ez for nairo
Andrew,the taunt combo
Andrew,poggers
Andrew,what a god
Andrew,+30 win inbound
Andrew,
Andrew,picking a heavy was pretty smart
Andrew,I want to see the score ffs
Andrew,Finally no items
Andrew,or smash balls
Andrew,and best of 3
Andrew,lets go
Andrew,mildly serious match
Andrew,and a real stage
Andrew,zero playing smash 4 lol
Andrew,
Andrew,bayo's not as busted hurray
Andrew,it was just ridley being massive
Andrew,I'm glad the neutral b has more knockback tho cause it suuuucked before
Andrew,good balancing act
Andrew,The bullets?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,bullets were as if fox had 2 guns
Andrew,is MkLeo going to de throne ZeRo?
Andrew,dunno if really counts as a dethroning
Andrew,zero's been retired
Andrew,true
Andrew,how old is ZeRo
Andrew,?
Andrew,mid twenties I think?
Andrew,mkleo's like seventeen tho
Andrew,he is 23
Andrew,just found it online
Andrew,the end of a pro gamer age is around 23-25 apparently
Andrew,Why does Mario have no moves with Cappy? 
Andrew,cause then he would be garbage lol
Andrew,unless they were to make it like link's boomerang
Andrew,I mean there's a lot of smashers over 25
Andrew,most good csgo players are > 25
Andrew,zero didnt permenantly retire
Andrew,Why did he retire?
Andrew,stress
Andrew,the Brain in the Human body starts to decline brain activity around 25 and onward
Andrew,It may not be this case
Andrew,thats not true
Andrew,excuse me?
Andrew,Do you really want to do this over the knowledge of the human body?
Andrew,the reason most esports players retire is burnout not physical decline
Andrew,"After 25 your reaction time, multitasking capability and and memory begin to slip."
Andrew,"Mario vs. Sonic
ResidentSleeper"
Andrew,Where's your source?

Andrew,How Your Brain Changes With Age
Andrew,"Take control of your brain health by learning about how your brain changes as you age, and techniques to stay sharp."
Andrew,Not like it matters cause when I showed you sources before you did not take it seriously anyways lol
Andrew,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19542656/your-brain-as-you-age/
Andrew,Has Your Brain Already Peaked?
Andrew,New research from MIT suggests that mental decline begins far younger than is typically thought
Andrew,anyways
Andrew,YAY ZeRo!
Andrew,yeah but neither of those things is super important for smash
Andrew,and it's such a slow decline at first
Andrew,that experience is more important
Andrew,"like, there's street fighter players in their 30's"
Andrew,"very true, exactly"
Andrew,wow daigo is 37
Andrew,I didn't realize he was that old
Andrew,people with higher still take longer to age
Andrew,the age of retirement for both sports and esports is getting higher and higher
Andrew,so it the age of how long people live
Andrew,your point?
Andrew,federer is almost 37 and he still dominates when he is playing well
Andrew,that is my point
Andrew,i was just noting something interesting
Andrew,is he a very high skilled player?
Andrew,like Top teir?
Andrew,leffen on the right
Andrew,both players me and kameron have mentioned are old and still top 5 in their respective (e)sports
Andrew,then it is a correlation between the amount of skill the person has and the rate that the skill of a person declines. All I was saying is that the decline starts at the approximate age of 25. nothing else.
Andrew,you said their careers are basically over at 25
Andrew,which is provably not true
Andrew,hell it should be even worse in sports cause your physical skills also decline but it's still entirely possible to keep at it
Andrew,"I said ""the end"" not drop dead over  or done."
Andrew,The ending of a carrer does not have to be a drop dead date just a time period
Andrew,Is anything else happening today or is that it?
Andrew,I thought we were getting some sort of reveal
Andrew,Stream went dark
Andrew,F
Andrew,Is it over then?
Andrew,weird ass ending

else

Andrew,@Max where you at homie
Andrew,@Homies my parents dont think I should use the PC tonight
Andrew,Because concussion
Andrew,how bad is it?
Andrew,It's extra strong yeet 90%
Andrew,@Jed if you see Astoria at camp tell her she's a crazy bitch
Andrew,How did you get that diagnosed already?
Andrew,"Didnt actually. ER wait times were a few hours so I yoted home. I feel better though. Might be something minor, I did black  out though LOL"
Andrew,Hours long wait times at the ER sounds dangerous
Andrew,you get bumped at ER based on seriousness of your condition
Andrew,"hence how that time I thought I might have broken my wrist, I was in a nearly empty ER and still had a super long wait casue people with more pressing stuff kept showing up"
Andrew,"also, be very careful about concussions, if it's not feeling better tomorrow get it checked out"
Andrew,"cause they can cause serious long-term problems, especially if you don't realize you have one"
Andrew,@Trapezoider
Andrew,I am going to see my actual doctor tomorrow
Andrew,@Sak von Sak when did you break your wrist
Andrew,"I didn't, but I did do a decent amount of damage"
Andrew,in an entertainly stupid sequence of events
Andrew,"my house is near the top of a hill, and me and my brother decided it'd be fun to go down the hill on these -"
Andrew,"together, holding on to one another"
Andrew,m
Andrew,or
Andrew,on
Andrew,and taking turns throwing the other person further down to pick up speed
Andrew,and then their extra speed would be a boost to the other person
Andrew,"basically we eventually messed up, I hit a lawn, flew over it onto the sidewalk, and caught all my weight on a bad angle on my wrist"
Andrew,"it didn't break, but I messed up the bone and the connective tissue and stuff"
Andrew,hurt like hell
Andrew,and I was still in a sling/brace for a few weeks
Andrew,sylki
Andrew,you are a god damned legend
Andrew,@The Rona
Andrew,help us find your island
Andrew,we are finna tryna connect it
Andrew,There's a nether portal to it
Andrew,through my portal?
Andrew,yeah but we wanna railway
Andrew,Look at the coordinates
Andrew,"pffft today I learned that there's a speedrunning category for ocarina of time called ""dank percent"" where the goal is to get off a bug that makes it look like link is smoking a giant blunt as fast as you can"
Andrew,yee
Andrew,and it's officially recognized on speedrun.com
Andrew,world record at just over eight and a half minutes
Andrew,I'm just skimming the other officially recognized categories for this game and some are hilarious
Andrew,"like ""Go Home and Die %"", where the goal is to die while inside a house as fast as possible"
Andrew,What is the record for that one?
Andrew,8m18s
Andrew,there's also a category to complete the game without ever opening any doors
Andrew,"there's a category to complete the game all the way to the water temple, and then while inside get to a total of 37 small keys"
Andrew,@Sak von Sak have you seen full metal alchemist
Andrew,he thinks its overrated
Andrew,i think zacks overrated
Andrew,ava sums it up nicely
Andrew,"it's a solid show, but beyond the first chunk I felt like it just gets larger, more unweildy, and slower, and nothing it does beyond a few early bits really stood out to me"
Andrew,it just feels like a decently executed generic show that gets worse as it goes on
Andrew,"I agree, full metal alchemist is overrated."
Andrew,"I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it, at least not before a lot of other things"
Andrew,Especially brotherhood.
Andrew,"I haven't seen the original, but from what I've heard, it's even more filled with fluff"
Andrew,I'm one of those people who doesn't watch main stream anime. I stick to the more lesser know stuff.
Andrew,"And to me, (a true anime fan), main stream animes are just... Not good animes."
Andrew,how do you define a true anime fan
Andrew,?
Andrew,A true anime fan is someone who enjoys other animes then mainstream.
Andrew,"I would have gone with just ""a person who enjoys anime, regardless of other peoples' opinions of any given anime"""
Andrew,"Also, I feel like to be a true anime fan, you have to watch at least 5 different animes that aren't mainstream."
Andrew,also just in general I feel like there's literally no reason to subdivide a community and it'll only cause problems and toxicity and elitism
Andrew,both of those defintion are super arbitrary
Andrew,being a fan should be whatever you think it is
Andrew,True.
Andrew,I'm only saying what I define it as for myself
Andrew,idk i just find the gate keeping shit to be really autistic
Andrew,"@mrd256  stop being an elitist, that is so stupid. Anyone who says you have to watch non-mainstream anime to be a ""true anime fan"" is just trying way too hard to look cool and feel above other people. It literally doesn't matter at all. You're not special because you watch things that less people think are good. Get off your high horse."
Andrew,"Also, as someone who had an obsession with Yu-gi-oh for years you have no right to try to be cool lol"
Andrew,"on another note you said watch five anime that aren't mainstream. FIVE???? That's it? If you want to go on about ""true anime fans"" it should at least be someone who has seen a heck of a lot of anime. My list is up in the 80's (which isn't even all that much). Beat that, rookie."
Andrew,Who said I only watched five?
Andrew,"okay hot shot, how much anime have you watched?"
Andrew,but honestly it doesn't even matter
Andrew,people are entitled to like whatever anime they like and I think all people's opinions are equally valid because they're just opinions about stupid entertainment media and it doesn't matter
Andrew,and this is coming from someone who has watch both mainstream and non-mainstream anime
Andrew,"@Feral Nebula It's probably not as much as you, but I have watched more than 5
Owari no Seraph
Ore no Twintail narimasu
Kissxsis
High School DXD
Date A Live
Angel Beats
Charlotte
Erased (even though I hated it)
Fuuka 
Rakudai kishi no Cavalry
Miira no Kaitaka
The Devil is a part timer
Shinmai Maou no Testament
Caligula
and I can list more if I need to"
Andrew,I didn't need a list lol
Andrew,you asked for it
Andrew,that's only 14 lol
Andrew,and isn't Kissxsis an incest anime ???
Andrew,still more than 5!
Andrew,isn't it hentai?
Andrew,but it's a gulty pleasure
Andrew,pffft
Andrew,no it's not a hentai
Andrew,I stay away from hentai at all costs
Andrew,okay buddy
Andrew,also tbh most of those anime ARE mainstream. Maybe not as mainstream as naruto or FMAB but they are still well known. And the ones that aren't on your list are just plain bad lol
Andrew,well yeah
Andrew,then what kinda point are you tryna prove ????
Andrew,"big animes like Naruto, One Piece, Boku no Hero Academia, FLCL, and others of such are ones I try to stay away from"
Andrew,FLCL????
Andrew,is that mainstream??
Andrew,the new series
Andrew,I forget what it's called.
Andrew,I know what you're talking about but that anime is not mainstream as much as naruto ect.
Andrew,"whatever, believe what you want to believe"
Andrew,lol okay
Andrew,have fun thinking you're cooler than you are
Andrew,the real answer is none of us are cool because we all watch anime
Andrew,coming from a girl says she's a weeboo
Andrew,"I just called myself uncool too, you know"
Andrew,but the weeb thing is a joke. I'm not the actual definition of a weeaboo
Andrew,I never said I was cool. I was just trying to say I don't like to watch (many) mainstream animes
Andrew,"right, but when people are being elitist they are trying to make themselves look higher than others"
Andrew,"""a true anime fan"""
Andrew,I'm just trying to say that is a toxic mindset
Andrew,I didn't say I was the only one
Andrew,I didn't say you said that wym ???
Andrew,throws arms in the air and gives up
Andrew,later
Andrew,haha
Andrew,I'm so amused
Andrew,"slides back in briefly
in all fairness, as much as the 'true anime fan' thing is often toxic and elitest, the majority of the toxicity and elitism in this conversation is coming from ava"
Andrew,"so get off yo high horse, ava"
Andrew,whaaaaat
Andrew,Im not ! !
Andrew,   thank you Zack!
Andrew,people who use that emoji unironically should die
Andrew,it's just hard to talk to stupid people so I'm sorry if I sounded toxic
Andrew,"let's see:
you called him a rookie,
one of his shows a hentai,
laughed at his guilty pleasure,
told him most of what he'd seen was bad,
etc., I'm too lazy to pick through the rest of this"
Andrew,also that is one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard
Andrew,because you insulted him during the apology
Andrew,I largely agree with your general opinion about stuff but you're arguing it so badly
Andrew,I wasn't trying to be sincere lol
Andrew,also I called it a hentai because i genuinely thought it was
Andrew,whoops
Andrew,but anyway I was saying all that stuff because he thought he was too good and I wanted to knock him down I guess
Andrew,"anyhoo, this whole discussion is such a mess that I would genuinely prefer to go back to work than continue having it, so I'm out"
Andrew,woah
Andrew,sorry Sylki
Andrew,well that conversation got out of hand real fast lol
Andrew,Holy shit
Andrew,I ask Zack if he has seen a show I'm watching
Andrew,And the retard fort opens the floodgates of autism
Andrew,"goddammit I'm on hold and they go ""press the pound sign to not have to listen to music"""
Andrew,so I did
Andrew,and instead they're now just advertising themselves
Andrew,this is not what I wanted
Andrew,Who you calling sylk boi
Andrew,a hosting service cause the hosting's all fucked up
Andrew,why are all the hardest parts of getting a website going things that have nothing to do with making the website
Andrew,i know right its some stupid ass shit
Andrew,@Zain has Daniel contacted you? I think I'm going to rape him on your behalf

Andrew,Keep listening to 500 miles
Andrew,HOpe you can find a solution to whatever problems are plagueing your work
Andrew,"it's like,

Andrew,"I mean, you don't see any marios in top 10 these days"
Andrew,he's 15th now
Andrew,I was saying that we had figured out he was bad
Andrew,"it's more just, how had top players not figured out how to beat roy"
Andrew,This guy must have just been good
Andrew,"Also, the cc meta pretty much didn't exist then"
Andrew,fair
Andrew,"still, step it up 2005 melee"
Andrew,If any of us went back to 2004-5 melee we probably could have been top players. With how far the meta has come I imagine an average player today could be excellent

Andrew,That was so close
Andrew,he'd better go ham in loser's

Andrew,I've ended up half working and half watching other games cause melee's still pretty meh for the most part
Andrew,I'm currently watching one of the most busted and poorly balanced fighting games of all time that's being run at a side event at evo
Andrew,Which game is that?
Andrew,it's this ancient snes sailor moon fighting game
Andrew,"there's two torontonians in winner's finals, so I'm hyped for that, I guess"
Andrew,also they both play hilariously busted characters so I can't wait to see that match
Andrew,link?
Andrew,"one character has absurd range on all her moves, a full screen dash, and a really strong command grab
the other one is crazy fast, and if they get under around 1/6 health they can stall infinitely and slowly chip you down until you have less health than them at timeout and they win"

Andrew,Finna fight me at 9:15
Andrew,good sheik players make sheik look like such a good character
Andrew,whereas bad spacies make spacies look trash lol
Andrew,I dont get why fox players ban to battlefield vs sheik
Andrew,when most sheik players counterpick battlefield
Andrew,just ban bfield and then FOD or yoshis based on preference
Andrew,they could leverage the stage advantage so much more
Andrew,"As a sheik player, which stage do you prefer against foxes"
Andrew,i mean it doesnt really matter cause im not very good
Andrew,colbol beat amsa
Andrew,imo the fox-yoshi matchup is like 65-35
Andrew,RISHI BEAT M2K
Andrew,SMASH GOD
Andrew,wouldnt it be sick if there was a top player who was a puff/marth dual main?
Andrew,like what if hbox had m2k's marth
Andrew,Then they would be unstoppable
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane wanna watch Evo when I get home from work?

Andrew,join the cord ill explain
Andrew,@Zain Is darwin project good?
Andrew,I like it
Andrew,Is it a game that could be played together or is it only solo queue?
Andrew,@Melee this training pack is actually really really cool
Andrew,highly recommended
Andrew,Lololol I didn't see sm4sh grands but what I'm hearing about it sounds hilarious
Andrew,Bayo dittos
Andrew,Whole crowd booing
Andrew,Apparently at one point they both sat on opposite ends of the stage and charged neutral b for so long a TO had to come out and give them shit about it
Andrew,Game's dead I think
Andrew,Or maybe this is what happens when #1 and #2 can't make evo
Andrew,Nobody fucking cares about that game anymore
Andrew,Melee is still hype
Andrew,Bayo and Cloud were the worst things to ever happen to smash 4
Andrew,It was pretty balanced before then
Andrew,The list of viable characters was pretty long
Andrew,But still fundamentally boring to play and watch
Andrew,They are playing the DK rap on the evo stream lol
Andrew,"also, at least cloud is actually fairly fun to watch, compared to a lot of the cast"
Andrew,bayo not so much
Andrew,Guy with a smash ultimate shirt standing behind the players
Andrew,Announcement incoming?
Andrew,I think the leaks said something was supposed to get announced at evo
Andrew,They did
Andrew,"and even without that, evo's a pretty good time to announce anything about a fighting game"
Andrew,I think a few other games have had little announcements already
Andrew,hey I overslept is this the first match @Max
Andrew,There have not been any games yet
Andrew,fantastic
Andrew,did i miss anything on the stream
Andrew,no
Andrew,fantastic
Andrew,YO HBOX
Andrew,he just took 3 stocks in like 40 seconds
Andrew,why did he ban fd and not stadium?
Andrew,I think FD is worse
Andrew,Right call imo
Andrew,hot take leffen wins evo
Andrew,Lets go
Andrew,wow
Andrew,"3 stock in hbox's favour, last hit, 3 stock in leffen's favour"
Andrew,wack set
Andrew,just to note my message was before stock 1 of the 3rd game
Andrew,Amazing not to tilt after game 1
Andrew,although real talk hbox was flubbing left and right
Andrew,I say he's either gonna crumble or go on a nutty loser's run
Andrew,time to cheer for wizzy over swedish
Andrew,no
Andrew,swedish
Andrew,lets go
Andrew,@Zain Mango about to play
Andrew,alrightr
Andrew,"I like swedish, but wizzy has a much much better record over hbox"
Andrew,yeah of da sheiks
Andrew,https://www.twitch.tv/evo
Andrew,evo - Twitch
Andrew,EVO 2018 - CHAMPIONSHIP SUNDAY
Andrew,also swedish has looked good against hbox in da past
Andrew,and plup beat him with sheik at CEO
Andrew,We could have armada Hbox for 4th
Andrew,plup is so good
Andrew,and mango so bad
Andrew,rip mango
Andrew,that
Andrew,was so sad
Andrew,that was a very mango set
Andrew,That was pretty good
Andrew,"he played amazing for a chunk of it, mediocre for a chunk, and SD'd a bunch"
Andrew,the first game was sick by plup tho
Andrew,yaw first game plup was playing out of his mind
Andrew,New gods winners finals
Andrew,lets go
Andrew,big house part 2
Andrew,This is winnable
Andrew,S2J has almost beat him before
Andrew,"and when he did, he won the first two games"
Andrew,which would be the set in this case
Andrew,that'd be crazy though
Andrew,I'd put like 80/20 odds on armada winning
Andrew,shoutouts2jesus
Andrew,
Andrew,?
Andrew,That's s2j
Andrew,oh
Andrew,someone said in chat
Andrew,armada has gotten 3 stitches since being put in losers
Andrew,the script boys
Andrew,damnn
Andrew,those stocks were spicy
Andrew,SHOUTOUTS TO JESUS
Andrew,hes losing on fod tho
Andrew,He might opt for fd instead
Andrew,huh
Andrew,bfield?
Andrew,S2J can do this
Andrew,I wanna see armada mango
Andrew,not s2j mango
Andrew,chokes
Andrew,rip
Andrew,so many special turnips
Andrew,chooooookes
Andrew,s2j choked that so hard
Andrew,S2j is out?
Andrew,"Hey guys, I'm here from Guilty Gear, just wanted to say that I can see why you were being a bunch of immature children in chat - seeing as you literally play a kids game. Honestly, it's just sad seeing you losers spam emotes every time Mario does his jump attack or whatever. Grow up!."
Andrew,What is this copy pasta
Andrew,From the chat
Andrew,ik
Andrew,@Trapezoider S2J is out but wizzy is still in
Andrew,
Andrew,Waiting for this special ed kid's game to be over so I can watch some fucking tekken.
Andrew,same
Andrew,I HAVE A 3 WORD ESSAY DUE TOMORROW AND I'M WATCHING MELEE NotLikeThis
Andrew,Why is this Swedish dude wearing sunglasses
Andrew,he has eye issues
Andrew,its not just for style
Andrew,is winners finals b05 or just losers and grands?
Andrew,I think winners finals is bo5
Andrew,Leffen said so on his twitter at least
Andrew,Did you guys just see the camera?
Andrew,well he could just be saying that because hes gonna be in either grands or losers finals
Andrew,rip
Andrew,wow mango
Andrew,that was... pretty bad
Andrew,how does he almost always play terrible at evo
Andrew,we need a better bird player
Andrew,He puts a lot of pressure on himself probably
Andrew,the bird must fly again
Andrew,"From chat ""we live in a world where s2j took a game off armada and mango didnt... hmmmm"""
Andrew,lol
Andrew,"real talk tho, mango was playing really sloppy"
Andrew,like s2j game 3 slop
Andrew,ouch wizzy
Andrew,wizzy finna save melee?
Andrew,The only falcon to ever play the character correctly
Andrew,yeah n0ne of course
Andrew,also 1/4 of both the top 12 and top 8 were falcon players thats pretty wack
Andrew,its over
Andrew,bruh
Andrew,damn
Andrew,damn
Andrew,that was super close though
Andrew,hbox's pressure was so good once he had the lead though
Andrew,wizzy needed space and hbox wasn't giving him any
Andrew,leffen unstopable
Andrew,I'll stop him
Andrew,go chris
Andrew,fox ditto time?
Andrew,lol
Andrew,rip
Andrew,Leffen is so good
Andrew,My inspiration
Andrew,he's crazy
Andrew,plup is kinda like new mew2king
Andrew,he gets deflated p easy
Andrew,i dont see him winning in losers
Andrew,ouch
Andrew,yo boys we finna play some melee after evo
Andrew,this is so tense
Andrew,this aint even grands
Andrew,ouch
Andrew,Almost a time out
Andrew,clutchbox please
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,is wizzy still here?
Andrew,no
Andrew,NO
Andrew,well i have no reason to watch this tream then 
Andrew,rip
Andrew,Melee is saved
Andrew,Thank god armada won
Andrew,evo is hype
Andrew,hes so chubby
Andrew,watch anyway
Andrew,yeeees armada
Andrew,Hbox doesn't even have shoes on
Andrew,guys can we joinup like????
Andrew,This is hype city
Andrew,leffen plup armada top 3 this is pretty much as well as I could have hoped for
Andrew,
Andrew,its not even grand finals
Andrew,plup leffen grand finals
Andrew,Lets go
Andrew,that's what I'm hoping for
Andrew,"I want fifteen games from hereon out, and I honestly don't really care that much how they go if we get that"
Andrew,My boy big leff better win this
Andrew,@Melee can we all joinup for grandfinals ples
Andrew,not gonna lie armada winning would be sick
Andrew,no
Andrew,gay^
Andrew,even though i dont likeem
Andrew,I kinda want the armada insane loser's run
Andrew,I want to listen to the casters
Andrew,armada winning would mean beating 6 of the other top 9 members
Andrew,and every other top 6 player
Andrew,FROM LOSERS
Andrew,who did wizrobe play before hbox knocked him out
Andrew,i cant see on the bracket
Andrew,to get the 3vo
Andrew,swedish
Andrew,which other evos did armada win
Andrew,2015 2017
Andrew,2017 and 2015
Andrew,"over hbox in 2015, mango in 2017"
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,mango won 2013 and 14

Andrew,press 1 to vote for armada
Andrew,1
Andrew,is this live?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,:0
Andrew,LETS GO PLUP
Andrew,wait
Andrew,was the rest of the bracket 2/3?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,wow
Andrew,it's cause it's evo
Andrew,they need it to run quickly enough
Andrew,also the evo top brass don't much care for melee
Andrew,hence our shitty time slot
Andrew,why
Andrew,we bring so much to the event
Andrew,Thats so dumb
Andrew,cause they're old school fgc people
Andrew,Dont we literally get the most viewers?
Andrew,"the main head guy apparently loooooves tekken even though it doesn't get as good viewership as melee, sf, dbfz and he gave tekken a ton of preferential treatment"
Andrew,thats so dumb
Andrew,i didnt know the evo staff was gay
Andrew,randall!!
Andrew,melee in particular has a history of getting shafted in various ways at evo
Andrew,this year's the worst though probably
Andrew,I missed most of top 8 because of this time slot
Andrew,Armada hype
Andrew,Didn't we get Saturday last year
Andrew,oh yeah
Andrew,but at least we didn't have super early morning pools
Andrew,"""Whenever I see top players do what I do. Alarm bells"""
Andrew,Scar is awesome
Andrew,he's a good commentator for higher level discussion of stuff
Andrew,"where he's not as deep in the nitty gritty details, but he understands players and mentalities really well"
Andrew,Have toph and scar done every evo?
Andrew,fox is stupid
Andrew,no u
Andrew,YES
Andrew,up air is such a dumb move
Andrew,"I don't think they did the super old school evos, but I'm pretty sure they've done top 8 or at least top 4 from 2013-2018"
Andrew,jbaited
Andrew,"honestly, it wouldn't feel like evo at this point without scar and toph"
Andrew,they are such a good combo
Andrew,armada 4 stock
Andrew,also real talk
Andrew,how many times has plup gotten 3rd at evo
Andrew,+1 more times
Andrew,I feel bad
Andrew,yeah plup's not looking like his normal self
Andrew,the boost grab he missed was so sad
Andrew,
Andrew,Time for leffen to take it
Andrew,ever since he beat mango he's been not looking that good
Andrew,"but yeah, I think this is... 3 or 4 now"
Andrew,rip
Andrew,poggers?
Andrew,Nintendo direct in 3 days
Andrew,
Andrew,pfft nintendo cop out on making an actual announcement
Andrew,poggers
Andrew,they announced an announcement
Andrew,what a bunch of fucking champs
Andrew,I dont like the evo stage this year
Andrew,it was way cooler last year
Andrew,
Andrew,WAIT ITS THE SAME?????? It looks so different from some of these angles
Andrew,"I honestly don't really care who wins this, so long as this is as good as their sets normally are"
Andrew,
Andrew,that nose shine
Andrew,Leffen looking fresh
Andrew,holy shit
Andrew,what a fucking god
Andrew,"""proto tractor pro tractor"
Andrew,what a fucking new god
Andrew,what was that???

Andrew,zack go back to work

Andrew,I will get bodied
Andrew,When is this happening
Andrew,Tonight if everyone is available I think
Andrew,I mean I think no matter what the team with me as the 'experienced' player is gonna get fucked

Andrew,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

Andrew,The more you ask the furthur away it becomes
Andrew,"Boys, I found a new game for us to play"
Andrew,"I'll tell you guys about it later, but it's really fun"
Andrew,@Homies
Andrew,whats it called?
Andrew,"""I'll tell you guys about it later"""
Andrew,ffs tell us the name now
Andrew,so we can look into it
Andrew,and play it later
Andrew,No
Andrew,Tell us what it is
Andrew,"Ok, you twisted my arm as far as it will go"
Andrew,It's not on steam by the way
Andrew,It's called
Andrew,Primeops
Andrew,It's free at
Andrew,ProductofPrimes.itch.io/Primeops
Andrew,The devs are a friend of my buddy
Andrew,It's real fun
Andrew,Also you're gonna need a controller to play
Andrew,Will Xbox work?
Andrew,I'll get it tonight
Andrew,I'll be home at 7:30-8 pst
Andrew,Yo boys my 28 yr/old retarded sister is finally moving out
Andrew,HYPE
Andrew,Xbox works
Andrew,"pools commentary is, although kind of crap, perfectly fitting for pools"
Andrew,they're not even talking about the set except for every now and then
Andrew,they're just going off on ridiculous tangents about photosynthesis
Andrew,"but like, it's sfat bodying some rando"
Andrew,actual commentary would be kinda weird
Andrew,holy shit mango almost lost that set
Andrew,Who was he against?
Andrew,some random puff
Andrew,he's not even top 100
Andrew,Was he playing Falco?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,"lololol he just walked over to the commentary and goes ""no one ever talks about my good double lasers. Those were some good double lasers that set"""
Andrew,nothing about the fact that he just went last hit with some non-top 100 player
Andrew,"Ok @Homies I gotta break the news to you now, I don't think the game has online multiplayer"
Andrew,bummer dude
Andrew,I'm becoming more and more sure that hbox takes damage on purpose once he is at 50 until he is at around 90.
Andrew,Why?
Andrew,So that all the easy kill setups don't work
Andrew,"at around 90 you can't really upthrow upair, weak nair upsmash, I dunno if jab upsmash works (I think jab upair still works but it's hard)"
Andrew,Are you guys seeing this
Andrew,basically your only safe-ish kill option becomes bair at like 140
Andrew,Those drawings lol
Andrew,"also, n0ne 3-1'd wizzy let's go"
Andrew,he's gonna get bodied by zain probably though
Andrew,When I play vs puff I actually don't laser past up throw up air %
Andrew,also pewpewu vs s2j should be good
Andrew,oh damn moky brought shroomed to game 5
Andrew,lol n0ne
Andrew,he was going so ham
Andrew,and then he just
Andrew,jumps in the middle of a marth combo
Andrew,and that's that
Andrew,Did mango drop out of shine?
Andrew,naw
Andrew,there's two brackets to top 8
Andrew,this is only one half
Andrew,there's still another 32 person bracket going on after this
Andrew,These stats are so pointless
Andrew,They should have the openings per kill stat
Andrew,That is by far the best one
Andrew,or edgeguard %
Andrew,Yo
Andrew,What tourney is going on?
Andrew,shine 2018
Andrew,S2J vs Wizzy about to start
Andrew,I'm sure you want to see that one

Andrew,we tryna play some games kids?
Andrew,man plup had such a nice run to top 8
Andrew,fairly weak puff -> samus ditto -> ics
Andrew,"man why are they like ""in case you sheiks are struggling with this matchup, these tips might help!"""
Andrew,they don't need the help
Andrew,we samuses need the help
Andrew,It is probably because neither of them know what help to give Samus. Sheik knowledge is much more widely known.
Andrew,fair enough
Andrew,"also, apparently void (the sm4sh guy) is pretty good at dbzf"
Andrew,"he made top 8 at shine, which, while not super stacked, still has a few names I recognize"
Andrew,admittadly they're both names I know from different games (one from skullgirls and one from p4au) but presumably they're still pretty good
Andrew,What is p4au?
Andrew,persona 4 arena
Andrew,I'm not sure why they add the u
Andrew,possibly the full title of one of the updates? persona 4 arena ultimax?
Andrew,and also possibly cause p4a might be the acronym for persona 4 the animation
Andrew,duuuuck that was a free fsmash
Andrew,why did you try for bair
Andrew,that only would have killed on sweet spot
Andrew,I honestly think he might have taken that game if he'd just done fsmash

Andrew,"so for some reason, in toronto all the weeklies I used to go to are on hiatus"
Andrew,but I found that there's a weekly like fifteen minutes walk from my house
Andrew,the only problem: it usually only gets been 3 and 6 entrants
Andrew,"is it worth my time? it won't be a great tourney probably, and their schedule is wack as hell, probably to accomadate for the fact that they're running melee, sm4sh, and pm separately cause the venue is tiny"
Andrew,"on the flip side, I've got a good chance of placing in the money"
Andrew,I think you should go
Andrew,I probably will
Andrew,just to get a little melee in

print('\nInterest = %0.2f' %interest)



For some reason when I am testing this and entering the roi, it spits out this"
Andrew,"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""F:\PROGRAMS\calculator.py"", line 4, in <module>
    years = input(int('Duration (no. of years) ?'))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Duration (no. of years) ?'"
Andrew,should be int(input('duration'))
Andrew,so I dont wanna use a float value for roi
Andrew,OH
Andrew,this is for years
Andrew,did you read the error message?
Andrew,it tells you which line is going wrong
Andrew,and a description of why
Andrew,IVE Never debugged
Andrew,i didnt get what the mans was trying to tell me
Andrew,im using Thonny as my editor
Andrew,"in this case, that there was something going wrong with the int() funciton, specifically that the arguments you gave it were invalid"
Andrew,"at the very least, that should tell you where and what is going wrong"
Andrew,"it has the problem after the roi bit because once you input the roi, it tries to run the next line of code, which has the error"
Andrew,i fixed it
Andrew,now i got another bug
Andrew,ayo
Andrew,i made a calculator. @Sak von Sak whats another easy beginning project I can work on
Andrew,one I had fun with was making a text adventure game
Andrew,oh wow
Andrew,that sounds difficult
Andrew,ill give it a go
Andrew,do you know how to do loops yet?
Andrew,cause you're gonna need em
Andrew,no sir
Andrew,i know how to print
Andrew,how to make variables
Andrew,ok step one learn how to do for and while loops
Andrew,that with what you already know should be enough
Andrew,thank you sack
Andrew,@Homies what's the biggest mistake New comers make when learning a programming language? What's the most common trap to fall into that will set you back instead of progressing your learning
Andrew,this question makes no sense
Andrew,yea
Andrew,i mean i guess
Andrew,i think people shouldnt focus
Andrew,on syntax and the language in it self
Andrew,more on what they wanna make in it
Andrew,incorrect syntax
Andrew,but i dont
Andrew,think
Andrew,theres
Andrew,much that could set you back
Andrew,when learning a language
Andrew,Why would you need to need to make that 5 messages
Andrew,"programming isn't like english where you can do something wrong without noticing, if something is wrong in programming it wont work period"
Andrew,so if things are working you're gucci
Andrew,and if they aren't figure out why
Andrew,ayyy anyone wanna play some ow or melee later? @Homies

Andrew,"A little tip that might help you @Trapezoider is to plan, either in your head or on a piece of paper, what the main function of your program is probably gonna look like"
Andrew,ye
Andrew,think about the process before the code
Andrew,Just jumping straight into it can get confusing
Andrew,and make you lose track
Andrew,Planning I feel can also help with the efficiency of your program

Andrew,@Zain Don't leave without talking with me real quick please
Andrew,ok
Andrew,"aight so if I get a switch it's ~$380, but if I get a switch and either BoTW or Odessey it's ~$420 (so basically $40 for a game I was planning on getting anyway)

which should I go for?"
Andrew,Personally I think I would go for Odyssey
Andrew,If you like more of a 3d platform-ish style with a more linear story
Andrew,It's movement is fantastic and really satisfying to pull off
Andrew,There is a lot of content in the game if you like going and collecting the moons
Andrew,The puzzles in the game are fun and interesting
Andrew,The capture mechanic is also really fun
Andrew,..........
Andrew,BotW on the other hand
Andrew,Is more if you like an open world adventure type game with a non-linear story that you get to explore at your own discretion
Andrew,I find the fighting very rewarding in this game but sometimes I feel that the weapons break too quickly for my liking
Andrew,hm
Andrew,"If you're looking for a traditional Zelda game with lots of dungeons and boss fights, there are only a handful of them in the game"
Andrew,But I liked the shrines enough to fulfil the dungeon portion
Andrew,I just wish there were more bosses
Andrew,"The exploring and doing whatever you want though is the main draw for the game, collecting things to make food and potions, doing side quests, taking out hordes of enemies, completing shrines to upgrade yourself"
Andrew,"I'm thinking I'll probably go with odessey, cause the other game I'm gonna get is xenoblade, which  will probably be good for my fix of more open world-ish stuff"
Andrew,all the exploration stuff and the story stuff 'n stuff
Andrew,Glad that I could help
Andrew,
Andrew,I'm planning on spending my entire first week's paycheck (after taxes) on games and stuff
Andrew,"including a proper hard drive so I'll finally not be able to make the ""it won't fit on my teeny tiny hard drive"" excuse"
Andrew,Zack make sure you get botw at some point
Andrew,Definitely one of those games you really gotta play at some point

Andrew,"for me personally, i feel like oddessy loses it's charm and collecting moons becomes boring after a while. while everytime i come back to zelda i learn something new or find more shit."
Andrew,i have alot more hours into zelda and still feel like i haven't found everything
Andrew,while oddessy feels like a grind
Andrew,"350 ish hours into zelda
120 ish into oddessy"
Andrew,"xenoblade is pretty linear btw. and bombards you with sidequests up the butt that you can't beat till later, or you do so many sidequests that you are overleveled"
Andrew,also get the dlc for xenoblade its amazing
Andrew,I will once I'm done the main game
Andrew,I'm with rainbow on the Mario thing
Andrew,I didn't even beat the game because I lost interest and found it boring
Andrew,You guys are a couple of hosers
Andrew,ill vacuum your fucking pork sword dweeb
Andrew,Finish Odyssey then come talk to me
Andrew,
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,melee?
Andrew,"alright, I've now got a 2TB hard drive, a switch, two games for it, and pokemon sun arriving within the next week"
Andrew,I am significantly less rich than I was ten minutes ago
Andrew,feelsgoodman
Andrew,wait did you choose oddessy or zelda
Andrew,very important question
Andrew,ZELDA IS BETTER AND HAS WAY MORE HOURS IN IT
Andrew,im pretty sure you didnt read the entire thing correctly
Andrew,you missed ODDESSY LOSES ITS CHARM
Andrew,also zelda has more content than oddessy
Andrew,especially if you include the dlc
Andrew,you're all too late I got odessey already
Andrew,i can lend you zelda
Andrew,I'm gonna get both at some point and early on I'd rather have more gameplay variety
Andrew,oh we should exchange switch codes
Andrew,it won't arrive till tuesday
Andrew,rip
Andrew,I don't think Odyssey loses its charm at all
Andrew,i meant more like. it doesnt captivate you to continue playing after you beat it
Andrew,"i beat the main story, got like 50 more moons then got bored of the game"
Andrew,because its the same shit
Andrew,It did for me
Andrew,I got all of them
Andrew,Except like 2 because idk where they are
Andrew,;-;
Andrew,I got around 400 moons? i dont remember...
Andrew,most of the moons are placed so easily
Andrew,and served no challenge to me
Andrew,the more challenging moons are placed so bs with no room for creativity
Andrew,especially the darker side
Andrew,I'm not saying oddessy is a bad game. im just saying that botw offers more. and would be the game i would recommend first.

Andrew,Is this personality test even good? @SWIRL GIRL
Andrew,there's no real evidence supporting its validity
Andrew,I just think its fun to think about
Andrew,the big five is another personality test that has a lot more research behind it if anyone wants another test to take
Andrew,That's the good one
Andrew,My distributions are as follows
Andrew,"Openness: 93rd %
Conscientiousness: 67th %
Extraversion: 98th %
Agreeablesness: 0th%
Neuroticism: 3rd %"
Andrew,@Trapezoider What trait would make someone have a high level of skepticism?
Andrew,Low openness
Andrew,And possibly high neuroticism
Andrew,Both of which run in your family
Andrew,Which family member are you referring to?
Andrew,Both your mother and your father
Andrew,You also got high conscientiousness from your dad

Andrew,down to clown for a bit
Andrew,is short hop needle cancel fair a thing? @Melee
Andrew,cause I feels like that'd be pretty effective
Andrew,I don't think a short hop provides enough airtime to both needle and do a fair.
Andrew,it does I tested it
Andrew,as long as you dont fast fall
Andrew,you can do it
Andrew,I would guess people avoid it because you can stil cc the fair while needle grab cannot be cc'd and it provides a greater potential punish.
Andrew,no needle cancel fair
Andrew,like threaten needles into fair
Andrew,I've never really seen that
Andrew,you cant needle into fair
Andrew,or maybe like needle cancel tomahawk
Andrew,@Max did you do thanksgiving dinner already
Andrew,yes
Andrew,same
Andrew,My family prefers to do it more for lunch then for dinner
Andrew,yuck
Andrew,after reading reddit for awhile a lot of casual/smash 4 players seem to think melee sucks because a lot of characters are unviable and the roster is small
Andrew,but like there are more varied character archetypes than any of the other games
Andrew,and arguable still more viable characters than sm4sh lol

Andrew,I found out who the guy banging on my door was
Andrew,Who?
Andrew,So
Andrew,little background
Andrew,Did you kick his ass?
Andrew,Mike yesterday ordered a new microphone on Amazon
Andrew,And it was supposed to come in today
Andrew,Like before 9:00pm
Andrew,So another little background
Andrew,We never get stuff delivered to our door
Andrew,because we are in a building and you need a key to access it
Andrew,and our mailbox is too small
Andrew,"so they leave it at the front desk of the main building, and they will send an email saying that they have your package"
Andrew,"So he gets the email from the delivery man saying that the thing is delivered, and he's now waiting for the email from the front desk"
Andrew,It's been like 30 minutes at this point
Andrew,so he decides to check the original email
Andrew,and in it there's a picture of the door to our room
Andrew,with the package on the floor
Andrew,So
Andrew,This guy somehow got inside of our building
Andrew,Went to our door
Andrew,knocked
Andrew,and fucking BOOKED IT
Andrew,"Like I heard the knock, got up and peered through the peephole"
Andrew,"and there was nothing, or nobody in the hallway"
Andrew,"Again a knock, the same thing happens"
Andrew,"nothing, and noone"
Andrew,So it seems like this company hired literally the Flash to deliver packages
Andrew,because I immediately got up to check the door and nobody was in sight
Andrew,Elusive as fuck
Andrew,Maybe he just ducked down
Andrew,But why would he do that
Andrew,It's literally his job to deliver the package
Andrew,Then again
Andrew,Why would he run away at mach 10

Andrew,@Max
Andrew,I think my endeavor for internet has finally ended
Andrew,You got it working?
Andrew,I have found a solution yes
Andrew,Awesome
Andrew,The correct solution is usually the simplest one
Andrew,"I tried a few different ways of turning my phone into a hotspot without data, tethering, Bluetooth"
Andrew,Tried some weird app that was supposed to work
Andrew,Just wouldn't connect
Andrew,So I just tried looking up how to connect my switch to the WiFi at my school
Andrew,All I have to do is email some tech support desk to put my switch on a whitelist so that it can connect
Andrew,Praise Reddit
Andrew,so you can play smash?
Andrew,"Hell yeah I can. I just need to send the email, I'm gonna do it later today"
Andrew,also 4 days 
Andrew,longest 4 days of my life
Andrew,Yeah no kidding. I wish it wasn't exam time right now though

Andrew,Wait why?
Andrew,@Max you at school?
Andrew,I just got back
Andrew,Why?
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane

Andrew,Ava is still doing school
Andrew,90f124d8
Andrew,@The Rona not allowed to buy things during December to avoid overlaps with Christmas so I've gotta wait till the 25th to either receive or buy it
Andrew,Feels bad man
Andrew,Yup
Andrew,It'd be less annoying if I was in exams and it'd be a good excuse to nor waste studying time
Andrew,But I'm working so it just kinda sucks
Andrew,Should have pre-purchased  the game before December 
Andrew,@Sak von Sak whatchu mean not allowed
Andrew,ur an adult
Andrew,with a job
Andrew,I mean I could but I don't out of fear of familial ostracization
Andrew,?
Andrew,why
Andrew,I guess me and Chris will just have an 18 day head start on you then.
Andrew,Hell yeah
Andrew,My Incineroar is gonna be popping off
Andrew,My name is weird now
Andrew,How did you do that?
Andrew,Some random guy in the UWaterloo discrod had it
Andrew,So I stole it
Andrew,is that supposed to be a really big uwu?
Andrew,I think so
Andrew,lol
Andrew,I'm just gonna leech off people every weekend
Andrew,Come leech off of me
Andrew,Actually don't
Andrew,At least not until the 18th
Andrew,You're kinda far
Andrew,Also I generally have an advantage from having played more sm4sh
Andrew,I hope to be able to catch up within a month but that might be too ambitious
Andrew,Assuming the game is fun
Andrew,I might just not like it
Andrew,Well see
Andrew,Aren't you in Toronto Zack?
Andrew,Oh are you back atm? As opposed to waterloo?
Andrew,After the 18th I am
Andrew,Sweet
Andrew,Although I have non-weekend time off until the 24th
Andrew,@Sak von Sak Which characters are you interested in for Ultimate?
Andrew,"Pichu, wolf, zelda, inceneroar are my main ones"
Andrew,Why not pikachu?
Andrew,Cause apparently pichu isn't awful
Andrew,but pikachu is probably #1 in the game
Andrew,The new Zelda looks kinda okay for once
Andrew,"A) don't have much faith in pre release tier lists
B) when have I ever cared about how good a character is over how much fun I have with them"
Andrew,She will probably be top tier
Andrew,Also yeah I'm hyped for good zelda
Andrew,I played some brawl recently and I still love brawl zelda
Andrew,"I'm interested in Snake, Simon, Ike, Bayonetta, and Meta Knight."
Andrew,So I'm excited for her not sucking
Andrew,8c38e79c
Andrew,wait
Andrew,sm5sh is out?
Andrew,Friday
Andrew,Get 5mash @Trapezoider
Andrew,they're calling it 5mash??? lol
Andrew,how is that even pronounced
Andrew,I have no idea
Andrew,I just did it because Andrew wrote it the other way
Andrew,oh
Andrew,Near the games announcement people were calling it smush
Andrew,I prefer 5ma5h
Andrew,"Or, if you're picky, 5mu5h"
Andrew,I like Ultimate
Andrew,"Pronounced ""five-muh-five-hrrrr"""
Andrew,Like the Hebrew throat h sound

Andrew,Thanks buddy
Andrew,yo kids
Andrew,crisis averted
Andrew,purchasing 5ma5h
Andrew,:pog:
Andrew,What changed your mind?
Andrew,well the main thing preventing me was a family rule about not buying stuff for yourself during december to avoid undercutting other people's christmas gifts
Andrew,but I just kinda asked if I could anyway
Andrew,you could also just
Andrew,do it without asking
Andrew,^
Andrew,"Wow you really didn't want to see me that much, huh?"
Andrew,You should get better internet for christmas
Andrew,"well if I didn't ask, I run the risk of having the game, getting it as a gift, and that being both a) real awkward and b) a wasted gift"
Andrew,also I literally have zero control over the terrible internet
Andrew,it has to do with the line into our house
Andrew,It used to not be this bad
Andrew,hey guys guess what
Andrew,What?
Andrew,What?
Andrew,UwU whats this
Andrew,"Hey guys, let's kill @Mr. Airplane"
Andrew,"@Mr. Airplane 
Spider GF: Catches you in her web
Spider GF: 88w88 whats this"
Andrew,this man
Andrew,its me
Andrew,@Max how do you asdi?
Andrew,I hate you
Andrew,DOn't answer him
Andrew,hold the cstick when in hitlag
Andrew,...
Andrew,You dissapoint me
Andrew,?
Andrew,how
Andrew,do I not press it before hand
Andrew,holding the cstick does not require pressing a button
Andrew,no
Andrew,do I hold it before the hit starts?
Andrew,you can
Andrew,why isnt it working then?
Andrew,but if you are not in hitstun you will do a move
Andrew,asdi is only 1 sdi input and usually isn't enough to make a differnece
Andrew,i mean asdi down
Andrew,why would you want to do that
Andrew,
Andrew,im holding the cstick
Andrew,but i still go up
Andrew,What is the situation here?
Andrew,Are you edgeguarding?
Andrew,this is an uncle punch challenge
Andrew,what % are you at?
Andrew,at really low % sometimes asdi down tech doesn't work
Andrew,well it SHOULD work cause its literally built into the game
Andrew,I don't really know what this even is
Andrew,
Andrew,(that means that it isn't important)
Andrew,That isn't what I mean
Andrew,I don't know the situation where you are trying to use this
Andrew,i just feel like the asdi down isnt working
Andrew,is ALL i need to do hold the cstick down?
Andrew,I think so
Andrew,You could try both sticks though
Andrew,did
Andrew,What % are you at
Andrew,maybe asdi just like doesnt work on my controller
Andrew,that is important
Andrew,max
Andrew,its a simulation
Andrew,it should work
Andrew,MODS... can... be... broken...
Andrew,try taunting
Andrew,this one is pretty trustworthy tho
Andrew,I'm not joking
Andrew,
Andrew,Maybe you are not timing everything correctly
Andrew,I really don't know
Andrew,you should really download this modpack
Andrew,i wanna see how many sdi inputs you can get on the upthrow upair sim
Andrew,i usually get 1 or 2
Andrew,which upon doing  r e s e a r c h
Andrew,should be enough to get out of upthrow upair p consistently
Andrew,but I know your good at it
Andrew,Maybe I'll get it when I go on break
Andrew,it seems like its prolly humanly impossible to get more than 3 inputs so I guess im doing it right
Andrew,melee is sick
Andrew,It is definitely possible to get at least 4
Andrew,either way im pretty sure 2 is really good
Andrew,https://twitter.com/unclepunch_/status/992525190063099905?lang=en

Andrew,Just leave your Switch plugged in @Trapezoider

Andrew,
Andrew,rip
Andrew,90%
Andrew,
Andrew,Its happening boys
Andrew,This intro song is weird
Andrew,Are you kidding
Andrew,That song is some fire
Andrew,This bitches voice is annoying tho
Andrew,D:
Andrew,YO THERES VOICE ACTING IN CAMPAIGN
Andrew,HYPE
Andrew,Imagine doing the campaign to unlock characters
Andrew,Isnt that what I have to do
Andrew,nope
Andrew,^
Andrew,how do I get all the dudes?
Andrew,"Play a game and do nothing but run and jump for 20 minutes then play games with 1 life and sd at the beginning. After every game, change the language."
Andrew,this gets all characters in 2-2.5 hours
Andrew,the fastest known method
Andrew,Im just gonna play campaign on easy. That sounds really unfun
Andrew,you will take way longer to unlock characters
Andrew,See you next week when you unlock everyone
Andrew,I dont need everyone
Andrew,Just falcon
Andrew,I think you will actually need to play story mode more than once
Andrew,I think you get Falcon pretty early
Andrew,Easy
Andrew,I don't recommend playing the same character in multiple games
Andrew,As in
Andrew,Not in the story mode
Andrew,Doing the method that Max described
Andrew,There is a set order that you unlock the characters in doing that
Andrew,Falcon plays completely different then he does in melee
Andrew,This Ost is some fire
Andrew,Okay I might do the thing
Andrew,Story mode sux because theres ITEMS
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,If you insist on falcon I remember he is unlocked early
Andrew,You still get to fight the characters by doing the other method
Andrew,So it's not like you're just sitting there unlocking mans
Andrew,You gotta beat them first
Andrew,whats the first thing I gotta do
Andrew,Run/ jump around for 20 minutes in a match
Andrew,don't fight just move
Andrew,plug in 2 controllers so the cpu doesn't attack you
Andrew,set the rules to time 20 minutes
Andrew,I dont have a second controller rn. Can I just not attack and try to live for 20 mins?
Andrew,If I take dmg is it over?
Andrew,You realise that a joy con is a controller
Andrew,you can take damage
Andrew,it is just annoying
Andrew,Are you using a gamecube controller Andrew?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,Then use your joycons as a second controller
Andrew,ez clapper
Andrew,Already started the time
Andrew,Not worth easy
Andrew,wavelanding kinda sucks

Andrew,I accidentally used the thing from kirby

Andrew,What do you mean you used the thing from kirby?
Andrew,the three piece ship
Andrew,I accidentally picked up all 3 and activated it
Andrew,no dmg though
Andrew,there is no need to start over
Andrew,All you are doing is increasing an invisible steps taken and times jumped counter
Andrew,As long as you continue to do those things everything is fine
Andrew,"so just keep jumping
?"
Andrew,literally it's totally fine
Andrew,What do I do after game one
Andrew,just move around and jump
Andrew,just run and jump for 20 minutes
Andrew,after the time runs out you will get to unlock ness
Andrew,"then play 1-stock games and as soon as you get a character, fight em then change the game language and then play more 1-stock games until you get everyone"
Andrew,then change the language and change the rules to 1 stock
Andrew,in system settings or game settings?
Andrew,game settings
Andrew,do I kill the ai during sudden death or let myself die?
Andrew,@Ultimate
Andrew,Doesn't matter
Andrew,so now just change language after every stock
Andrew,Dope
Andrew,Yup
Andrew,can i just go back and forth on languages?
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,dope
Andrew,can I interupt this process to play online
Andrew,I have no idea
Andrew,Or do I have to do the move thing again to start unlocking through language switcthing
Andrew,just suck it up and play mad one stock games
Andrew,It probably doesn't matter
Andrew,I wanna play you before I have to go chris
Andrew,Sauce up
Andrew,Join up

Andrew,Why not?
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane unblock me
Andrew,Nope
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,nope
Andrew,One final down three to go
Andrew,Looks like I'm changing mains in ultimate
Andrew,Why?
Andrew,Corrin's moves can't hit short characters
Andrew,they go right over their head
Andrew,I'm going to be a Shulk player now
Andrew,does shulk not suck ass in ultimate?
Andrew,pog
Andrew,I've seen people placing him high on tier lists
Andrew,no im not saying you're wrong
Andrew,im just like
Andrew,pog
Andrew,Max most of corrins best moves hit short stuff
Andrew,Down tilt
Andrew,Pin
Andrew,Nair
Andrew,Bite
Andrew,Shulk just does all the things I liked about Corrin better
Andrew,That wasn't the only reason for switching
Andrew,"But just so you know I meant that it was hard to kill short characters because fsmash and bair, which seem to be the two moves that kill the earliest, either don't hit short characters or are hard to land."
Andrew,Young link is still gay confirmed
Andrew,He can't be gay though
Andrew,He wears pink
Andrew,and gay men don't wear pink
Andrew,the math checks out
Andrew,the numbers dont lie
Andrew,@Ultimate Anyone down to play?
Andrew,10 mins then yes
Andrew,just join up when ready
Andrew,hot damn kingston sm4sh put out a PR for the game's entire lifespan and I juuuuust barely slid in
Andrew,"and it's really funny for me looking at everyone above me and being like ""yup, yup, yup, better than me, yup, yup"" for everyone ranked above me... except andybulb"
Andrew,which I'm basing entirely off the one time I fought him and booped him with captain falcon after not going to tournaments for like a year
Andrew,I'm sure he's probably done really well around that but oh well
Andrew,I'm still pretty happy I made it on this despite barely only really playing for like a year
Andrew,of the like four-ish years that there was a scene
Andrew,How did a Little Mac get so high
Andrew,Isn't Little Mac like really bad
Andrew,we had the best little mac in ontario
Andrew,second best in canada
Andrew,he 2-0'd the guy who was (at the time) #3 in ontario a few times
Andrew,"dude the whole PR up until #7 is low tier with the exception of DK who's like, mid tier"
Andrew,"the character spread is like
mid, low, low, low, low, low, very high, high, high, top, high, mid/high, low, mid, mid/low, top, top, low, low, low"
Andrew,we were a weird city
Andrew,is kingston just all zacks?
Andrew,@Ultimate
Andrew,Yee

Andrew,Were we playing the same game 
Andrew,Ok hold on though
Andrew,I also want to be in voice for that
Andrew,we gotta schedule this match
Andrew,Somebody has to do WWE voice casting
Andrew,but I thought he returned the game
Andrew,You guys can spectate the match
Andrew,You cant return games
Andrew,it was a joke
Andrew,You can't return games you bought from the eshop
Andrew,lol
Andrew,oh yeah spectating is a thing in this game
Andrew,Also I want to play y'all at some point
Andrew,HELL YEAH BOIS
Andrew,since when is a low tier match between two bad players deserving of all this hype?

""You thought it was an email from your coworker, but it was hooded hackerman""
and a graphic of some random dude in a shirt and tie would peel back and this dude would be behind it"
Andrew,I mostly just get a kick out of the idea of a generic hacker as a dude in a black hoodie with bright red sunglasses

Andrew,  OVERWATCH IS FUN
Andrew,Overwatch is fun ❗
Andrew,i think people who dont like it are just focussed too much on the wrong aspects of the game
Andrew,that's subjective
Andrew,i mean
Andrew,not really
Andrew,It completely is
Andrew,that's actually the truest thing you could say about anything
Andrew,if you dont like ow youre just a fat gay idiot
Andrew,i mean you could go a moba and i could say well you don't enjoy it
Andrew,because your focusing on the wrong aspects
Andrew,i mean sure
Andrew,but thats
Andrew,pretty retarded to say
Andrew,yeah maybe the fun aspects arent what you're interested in
Andrew,so you just dont like the game

Andrew,"pharah, bastion, orisa, junkrat would all be broken if dva was banned, and these aren't fun or interesting characters to play when left unchecked"

Andrew,Masteranime - is an anime info database with a streaming option to watch anime in HD. Join the community to keep track of your watched anime and get to follow friends to see what they're watching.
Andrew,Ooh thats a big spicy
Andrew,Thank
Andrew,"pretty much all of the anime streaming sites suck these days. They're all slow, low quality, and full of ads. You gotta torrent them yourself if you want quality."
Andrew,I caNT ANYMORE
Andrew,BECAUSE I USED TO PIRATE ALL THE TIME and now my ISP will rape me if I pirate again
Andrew,
Andrew,BIG sad
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,It was so dumb
Andrew,I haven't had any issues with anime torrenting
Andrew,I pirated BOTW to emulate
Andrew,but that didnt matter because my MAJORAS MASK ROM was the final strike
Andrew,lol stupid

Andrew,FRAN Playing Overwatch - Twitch Clips
Andrew,Jeff Kaplan destroys players below Diamond - Clipped by akbierly
Andrew,I really think that this argument is just false
Andrew,metas in ow apply to basically every skill tier above like silver
Andrew,like yeah other things can work in lower tiers
Andrew,but if people just randomly decided to run goats they would still probably win
Andrew,metas do not only rely on executing specific strategies but also the natural synergy between characters and the inherent strengths of characters
Andrew,like dva is just really really good so you are more likely to win with a dva than without at basically every elo
Andrew,yet the entire ow community seems to agree with Jeff here and uses this to argue about game balance like what
Andrew,yea i can probably agree with you was Jeff just saying this relating to something else or what? @Mr. Airplane
Andrew,he basically just said meta doesnt matter at plat and below
Andrew,and then on reddit people were like 'yeah meta doesnt even really matter unless you're in like the top 5% of players'
Andrew,Yeah that's retarded
Andrew,"hmm i mean i think your both probably right but think it's more like gold and to a greater degree silver and below, because at that rank people just don't have any fundamentals so they rarely can make use of playing the character or the comp to their maximum potential. I do admit if a team were to play goats they would be more effective than just picking random hero's due to the innate usefulness of goats. Metas do apply but not because the players are good or can make use of the meta comp but more just due to the comp it self just being better than what they would pick normally that's probably my perspective"
Andrew,bruh i literally just said that
Andrew,read my wall of text
Andrew,ok

Andrew,????????????????
Andrew,Dude what is going on
Andrew,daily vlogs    daily vlogs  
Andrew,
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,"What it mean when ya girl say """""
Andrew,Oh
Andrew,"kingston melee PR's out for this season, I can say with confidence I would have been on this if I was in kingston, based on the handul of tourneys I went to"
Andrew,Where would you place yourself?
Andrew,"I haven't played some of these people, but I'm say at least in the 7-9 range, possibly 6"
Andrew,Also where would you place me?
Andrew,Your region seems to lack good fox players.
Andrew,"for the people I have played: 0-3 with dayman, 2-3 with momba, 0-1 with boo, 1-1 with deep in thot, 3-0 with sasquatch, 0-2 with dog, 1-0 with whom"
Andrew,"I don't know honestly, I haven't gotten to play people all that much this season"
Andrew,or you cause our connection's pretty bad
Andrew,When you say 0-1 or 2-3 is that set count or game count?
Andrew,sets
Andrew,Are you going to bed soon or do you want to try some ultimate tonight?
Andrew,D&D till bed
Andrew,"but also I'm going to bed early no matter what, I'm starting to get a little sick so I want to make sure I get a good night's sleep"
Andrew,"also, if it was in games, how would I be 0-1 or 1-0 or 1-1?"
Andrew,Friendlies or a forfeit.
Andrew,I guess forfeit could make sense
Andrew,but I wouldn't count friendlies
Andrew,I remember you saying something once about a guy reporting a score as 0 - -1
Andrew,
Andrew,Gottem
Andrew,Nice job
Andrew,Now I just gotta beat ceroas
Andrew,fuck him up
Andrew,We should do an Ultimate tourney when Kameron gets the game
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,@Ultimate
Andrew,Probably with a character ban system like with melee
Andrew,Also @Trapezoider don't be big gay
Andrew,
Andrew,Oh yeah he also has the game
Andrew,Tournaments for this game will be cooler then our previous ones because we can host an arena for it and all the sets can be watched by the other players.
Andrew,Im selling my switch mang
Andrew,sorry
Andrew,
Andrew,unless zelda 2 gets announced
Andrew,Just give it to Jed so he can play
Andrew,
Andrew,Or don't be big gay
Andrew,I can imagine you selling your switch and then the very next day they announce the new Zelda game
Andrew,YO 4TH
Andrew,yeet
Andrew,THATS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BUT DESERVED
Andrew,@Trapezoider Don't sell yet
Andrew,^
Andrew,you gotta play more fam
Andrew,mmm I was expecting like 5th
Andrew,and had hopes of 4th
Andrew,you thought maybe they would put you below jarek
Andrew,yeah but that was fake I guess
Andrew,I wasn't going off stats on that i was just worried he'd be biased in the decision time
Andrew,but he wasn't
Andrew,noice
Andrew,yo I just did my math placement test and tested into math 250/260 thats good right?
Andrew,what is math 250/260
Andrew,cause its gonna depend based on the school
Andrew,like what is the name
Andrew,College algebra and trigonometry I guess?
Andrew,Generally 2xx courses are second year so that's probably good
Andrew,111 is college algebra at chemeketa
Andrew,"It's GCU though, I imagine they have a different naming scheme? Unless you are secretly a GOD at math :D"
Andrew,If it's the same as chemeketa that's calculus
Andrew,And stats
Andrew,I think they usually have similar naming systems
Andrew,I thought so too but then I compared my community college to the state college I'm transferring to and everything was WACK
Andrew,They literally had a whole website for translating which courses were equivelant between the schools
Andrew,True
Andrew,Maybe I lied
Andrew,Idk the projected math course for me was 154 but the test said 250
Andrew,Go on their website and find out which math that is
Andrew,I'm curious
Andrew,^
Andrew,You might be a math God?
Andrew,"Also Chris, thanks for help on math last year buddy. I used to hate it but now that I'm getting into the higher level stuff I'm really enjoying math!!!"

Andrew,@Mr. Airplane
Andrew,We can't help you unless we see
Andrew,"@Mr. Airplane I wouldn't grow your hair so long that people would say that you have ""long hair"" but less short then I remember you having would be fine."

Andrew,@Max what's ur gsp
Andrew,"I have no idea, it changes as the relative gsp of everyone else changes. So since I have not played in a few days it is probably different from what it was before by hundreds of thousands. I am in elite smash though, so if you are not at least that you aren't caught up yet."
Andrew,im just wondering
Andrew,^
Andrew,I'll go check in a few minutes

Andrew,that was an absolute shitshow
Andrew,Rip
Andrew,0-2?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,against some garbage players
Andrew,at least I've still got melee tomorrow
Andrew,I really want to try ultimate competitively but I can't justify buying a switch
Andrew,Just yoink Andrew's
Andrew,He is selling it though
Andrew,Exactly
Andrew,So just yoink it
Andrew,
Andrew,andrew's selling his switch??
Andrew,"Yeah, he's big gay"
Andrew,wow what a retard
Andrew,260 for 3 games and switch so issa good deal
Andrew,And I did just get a $250 bonus but like I have school to pay for soon
Andrew,buy it and resell the non ultimate games
Andrew,Good idea
Andrew,They are all digital though
Andrew,oh
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,Rip
Andrew,Ok I don't know if this is good advice so take it with a grain of salt
Andrew,Yeah you got school to pay for
Andrew,But you also gotta treat yo self sometimes you feel
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,Plus you got your entire school period to make money to pay for it
Andrew,This is also true
Andrew,"And in reality if everything works out the way I have planned I'll only actually be owing 3,000 out of pocket"
Andrew,That ain't too too bad
Andrew,Fingers crossed I can transfer to the Chipotle newar my school so I can get the reimbursement for the rest
Andrew,Yeah it's hella good
Andrew,Just don't come to me if this turns out to be a bad financial decision
Andrew,
Andrew,Also don't you have to pay for online monthly though?
Andrew,Yeah but it's only $20 a year
Andrew,Oh
Andrew,We might also start a frostbite family plan
Andrew,Plus if you do a family plan with the peeps in here it becomes a lot less
Andrew,Ay nice
Andrew,For example I'm only paying $8
Andrew,@Ultimate Anyone?
Andrew,No
Andrew,Botw and Mario are physical
Andrew,Oh shit

Andrew,since his defensive game isnt that strong
Andrew,he has to approach
Andrew,"Well I did pretty bad in pools, but at least there's an amateur bracket"
Andrew,On the flip side I won the rock paper scissors tournament

Andrew,anyone taken linera algebra?
Andrew,Me
Andrew,Okay
Andrew,Vector Quantization
Andrew,Im trying to collapse a series of audio channels into a single 1 dimension vector. My research keeps pointing me to a method called vector quantization
Andrew,I have the basics of what a vector is from this video
Andrew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs
Andrew,"Vectors, what even are they? | Essence of linear algebra, chapter 1"
Andrew,"I imagine many viewers are already familiar with vectors in some context, so this video is intended both as a quick review of vector terminology, as well as ..."
Andrew,but as soon as things get funky i get CONFUSED
Andrew,You got any insight?
Andrew,When do things get funkyÉ
Andrew,?
Andrew,Also I'm not sure I know what vector quantization is
Andrew,So my author talks about vector quantization then Markov Chains?
Andrew,Are these linear algebra things even???
Andrew,URRRGg
Andrew,❤
Andrew,"If it has to do with vectors, yes"
Andrew,
Andrew,Markov chain sounds like it's just a way of seeing sequences of possible events
Andrew,Vector quantization is definitly a linear algebra concept
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane Might know more?
Andrew,Bird boi!!!
Andrew,Come hither
Andrew,I have scooby snacks 
Andrew,Hmm
Andrew,A quick Google search reveals that vector quantization is also a statistics concept
Andrew,For creating a probability density function
Andrew,Well that explains why im confused
Andrew,I know nothing about probability density functions
Andrew,Im only in my first stats class this term
Andrew,You're definitly going to learn about them there
Andrew,Probably more towards the end though
Andrew,We just covered measures of variance / the normal distribution
Andrew,True
Andrew,Do probability density functions get pretty difficult
Andrew,because so far the class is easy
Andrew,Not really
Andrew,Cool
Andrew,
Andrew,Math is so cool
Andrew,Agreed
Andrew,markov chains is indeed linear algebra
Andrew,but i learned that like half a year ago i dont remember any of it lol

Andrew,it just felt super generic and the second half was basically like 6 episodes of story and a fuckton of padding
Andrew,Really :0
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,it's my very own Unpopular Anime Opinion
Andrew,(TM)
Andrew,Certainly
Andrew,I actually agree with Zack
Andrew,
Andrew,The last 20 episodes are a lot of ACTION
Andrew,But I still adore the show
Andrew,I love the soundtrack
Andrew,I've learned most of it on piano
Andrew,"action can rarely hold something up on its own, and FMA has pretty uninspired choreography"
Andrew,and there's just so much random stuff that felt like they threw it in without having much of a reason beyond padding the episode count
Andrew,Except for this fight scene... I think even you can agree this is top notch

Andrew,Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Alphonse vs. Pride and Kimblee
Andrew,Alphonse is a total badass! Subscribe to our channel for all the latest updates & videos! Website: http://www.animelab.com Like us on Facebook: http://www.fa...
Andrew,yeah that was a decent fight
Andrew,but for a show with as much fighting as there was nothing particularly standout
Andrew,like you look at most decent shows with a lot of fights and there'll always be at least a few crazy awesome fights and FMA just kinda doesn't
Andrew,"you look at like, 
Fate/ - saber vs lancer, kiritsugu vs kirei, shirou vs archer, etc etc etc
KLK - every ryuko vs satsuki fight but especially the first, the second proper ryuko vs nui fight, the episode and a half boat fight, etc etc etc
MHA: All might vs nomu, deku vs todoroki, etc etc etc"
Andrew,even some shows with basically zero fighting have really damn good fights every now and then
Andrew,see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2QkKGrTd6Y
Andrew,Tohru vs Kanna
Andrew,Anime: Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon

Andrew,"I love how twitch chat is memeing ""take this"""
Andrew,?
Andrew,Richter goes TAKE THIS when he brings out the jesus water
Andrew,ah I see
Andrew,Why would you play Richter over Simon?
Andrew,there's a few matchups where it's better cause of some weird property of the jesus water
Andrew,that is the literal only difference between the two
Andrew,Yeah but isn't the difference Simon's holy water has the fire property and Richter's doesn't
Andrew,I don't really know how it works honestly
Andrew,I think it's better to have one in some matchups? not sure
Andrew,Why would you not want to have the fire property
Andrew,or it might be that it only matters in some matchups
Andrew,"cause it's all the same hitboxes, they both do the thing where you're eating a whole bunch of hits if you're in it"
Andrew,it's just literally the type of damage
Andrew,which has some weird niche effects
Andrew,ARMADA VS APOLOGY MAN
Andrew,BATTLE OF THE TITANS
Andrew,thats a pog dude

Andrew,good question

Andrew,I'm still salty that slap city took stream priority over rivals
Andrew,slap's actually pretty fun

Andrew,man's like top 2 fish in canada

Andrew,"there's a solid sm4sh set going on right now (zackray, the guy who's been dominating japan) vs sonix (hella wifi warrior), and it's a great set but I'm really upset that both commentators are saying 'utilize' instead of 'use'"

Andrew,the smash elo system is dumb
Andrew,why do i gain more for beating somebody way lower rank than me than when i lose to somebody slightly higher rank
Andrew,If you're low elo you gain hella fast
Andrew,They want to separate the crappy players
Andrew,I've got the opposite atm
Andrew,I gain like nothing and lose a lot of I lose
Andrew,maybe its cause im playing a new character
Andrew,"For the first few matches of a new character, elo gains and losses are significantly increased."
Andrew,"Legit I was playing yesterday, went like 7-3 with my only losses to people with higher elo and at least 4 wins over people with higher elo, and went from 3.680 million to 3.682"
Andrew,It's weird

Andrew,I wonder how many people will actually make it out to the office
Andrew,My prediction is no more than 4 of the usual 15
Andrew,I think I'm gonna work from home today
Andrew,As I'm sitting here on a perfectly nice day getting ready for school. Sigh
Andrew,I would rather have your weather - I left my laptop charger at work so I'm gonna have to go out today to buy one
Andrew,In the cold and rain and ice and hail
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,you can work from home?
Andrew,Thats legit
Andrew,ATI wont give remote access under any circumstances
Andrew,Do you just RDP back to your desktop or does your laptop have all your projects?
Andrew,"Laptop has all my stuff, and I can connect to everything else remotely"
Andrew,Feels fucking bad. I still have classes
Andrew,
Andrew,"Slogged my way to school. Freezing half dead and ready to give in. Next thing you know, i see other people at home playing apex while they have no class"
Andrew,feelsbadman
Andrew,@Zain
Andrew,A classic
Andrew,"Pffft I'm in a video meeting atm to discuss how our depart did in the last quarter, and at one point they go ""the number of people using our services have skyrocketed! This is mostly because we broadened the definition of what qualifies as an active user, but it sure does make our numbers look good"""
Andrew,LOLOL
Andrew,Thats brilliant
Andrew,I love corporate bullshitery like that
Andrew,"In all fairness, even with our old metrics we did well, but also our new metrics made us look even better"
Andrew,"@Master Memers boys chris raw just pronouced Yosemite ""Yah-Meh-Set"""
Andrew,Chris wtf

Andrew,
Andrew,I know it's pronounced weird but that's just awful
Andrew,"""Yo-ze-mite"""
Andrew,"my life in japanese is ""yamen-nasai"""
Andrew,
Andrew,apex legends is a pretty fun battle royal
Andrew,"Okay, I just watched a video on this game and it looks like a lot of fun"
Andrew,I'll have to see how the shooting mechanics work though to know if I can enjoy it for more then a few days
Andrew,@TheRainbowpixelz How does the game make money?
Andrew,Do you start with all characters or do you have to buy them?
Andrew,All but 2 characters are unlocked
Andrew,All legends are sorta balanced.
Andrew,I'd yet because  I've only played it for less than an hour
Andrew,Ttk is mid to high. Guns feel super satisfying  to shoot
Andrew,Game makes money by cosmetic  microtransactions. Since the game is ftp it gets a half pass
Andrew,If all it sells are cosmetics that is amazing to me
Andrew,As long as it aint loot boxes
Andrew,Fingers crossed that ea doesn't pull an activision
Andrew,It is loot boxes
Andrew,As long as the majority of the gameplay content is not locked behind a paywall I'm game
Andrew,smh
Andrew,I do not care even a little how my character looks so I don't care how they do the cosmetics
Andrew,^
Andrew,I just want good and accessible gameplay
Andrew,Have you played Titan fall?
Andrew,no
Andrew,OK then don't worry. The movement feels as crisp as cod
Andrew,Never played cod either

Andrew,Not sure of my pc can run it but I have a new graphics card that I have not installed yet so that should help if I can't.
Andrew,Who does parties of 3
Andrew,It runs on a modified source engine
Andrew,yo
Andrew,awesome
Andrew,I get roughly 148 average fps
Andrew,On low
Andrew,I'm more worried about it functioning at all
Andrew,How much fos you get in cs

Andrew,no one cares about your annoying little crew
Andrew,"fuck off ava you don't do shit in here, we kick the people after we are done playing with them unless they're chill and we want to keep playing games with them"
Andrew,which I believe is the point of this server
Andrew,I actually do talk in here semi-frequently thank you very much
Andrew,and why even invite people if you literally plan to kick them
Andrew,just make a group DM?? duh
Andrew,"Damn just calm down boys and girls it's all good where just here to have some fun in the end, no need to start shit if you guys have some complaints just talk to me in DM instead of starting a flame war in chillin or don't do whatever you want lol."

Andrew,I am ready to refine my new main
Andrew,I got family over
Andrew,Who is your new main?
Andrew,Young Link
Andrew,Why?
Andrew,"Because while I really like Cloud and saw great results with him against  people worse then me, you need to hit most of your limits with him in order to beat people that are as good as or better then you. Limit is not something you can really combo into, so it requires a read to hit. Getting reads like that has always been something that I've been bad at compared to everything else. Young Link does not require reads in the same way to do well and also has a really awesome combo game, good projectiles, and a better recovery."

Andrew,"Its kind of unfortunate that the one part of our body that must always be kept exposed, our eyes, is so close to the one part of our bodies that must absolutely be protected, our brain."
Andrew,it makes it harder to damage something that would cause us to lose some or all of our vision
Andrew,cause there's fewer connecting parts that could be damaged
Andrew,also faster reaction times
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane  :-(
Andrew,Did not think of the first one but I have considered the second point. I'm just not sure how much faster it would be.
Andrew,"not much, which was why I brought it up as more of an afterthought"
Andrew,but generally most of our sensory stuff is on our heads so it might be some of that
Andrew,I dunno honestly
Andrew,I'm guessing more of my original first point
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,Brb
Andrew,A lot of sensory stuff is also in the spinal cord
Andrew,Most reflexes that we do come from it
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,You here???
Andrew,Can hear?
Andrew,Also I do think that the speed is important enough
Andrew,the spinal stuff is mostly for body senses something -> body reacts without mental processing stuff
Andrew,Correct
Andrew,so I guess that could work
Andrew,as a counterpoint
Andrew,hm
Andrew,The brain still gets information though
Andrew,just later yeah
Andrew,Just to let it know what it's doing
Andrew,For posture and stuff
Andrew,so I think I'm gonna stick with the protecting the connecting bits theory

Andrew,oh ew
Andrew,that's lame
Andrew,whoever wrote that is stupid
Andrew,
Andrew,sorry @Trapezoider @Jed i ended up having a long winded discussion with my friends about killing babies
Andrew,Abortion?
Andrew,I hope
Andrew,no
Andrew,killing living babies
Andrew,You mean that New York law?
Andrew,no
Andrew,just in general
Andrew,wait what did new york do
Andrew,You can kill a newborn through neglect and it will be legally considered abortion
Andrew,that's... not a good law
Andrew,that's a pretty terrible law
Andrew,Wait what the fuck
Andrew,That is horrible
Andrew,Who
Andrew,The fuck
Andrew,Thanks for at least being reasonable on this
Andrew,aren't you not even allowed abortions past a certain point in the pregnancy
Andrew,Voted for that
Andrew,because it starts getting enough brain to be at least somewhat conscious
Andrew,Different states can decide the point at which abortion is allowed
Andrew,how in the fuck
Andrew,"is a completely born, living baby"
Andrew,What argument could there possibly be for this law???
Andrew,not considered alive enough that that's a motherfucking problem
Andrew,I have no idea how this passed
Andrew,This is actually rediculous. Do you have a source for this?
Andrew,let me find one real quick
Andrew,Thanks crazy extremist left
Andrew,nah our argument was more like theoretical
Andrew,
Andrew,Perhaps some of the things I heard were exaggerations but an abortion when there should be a delivery is still pretty sad
Andrew,Not ruling out what I said as impossible though
Andrew,Yeah q
Andrew,based on that's it's just legal until birth
Andrew,Still crazy either way
Andrew,which is still a little sketchy
Andrew,but not anywhere near as crazy
Andrew,I think the after birth thing was a law currently being debated in Virginia based on what I read
Andrew,I think that's actually discusting still
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,but in comparison it's not as bad
Andrew,They are pretty equal
Andrew,depends on the timeframe of letting neglect kill your baby counting as an abortion
Andrew,It could be only seconds separating the time of death
Andrew,"Even if you don't want it, just put it up for adoption"
Andrew,"neglect would normally be like not feeding it, so I don't think it'd be seconds"
Andrew,I'm pretty sure the neglect thing real or not was to be done only right after birth
Andrew,seconds would be the doctor fucking up
Andrew,"but yeah, still quite fucked up"
Andrew,If you don't make a baby breath it can suffocate in seconds
Andrew,I know someone who is mentally disabled because the doctor couldn't make him breath soon enough
Andrew,"wouldn't have thought of that as neglect, but I dunno how the law looks at it"
Andrew,I was thinking neglect being parental
Andrew,anything else is just the doctor not being fast/good enough
Andrew,"you do understand nobody carries the baby up to full term and then decides at the last second, the law is put in place for babies that will die soon after birth due to debilitating complications"
Andrew,still a weird way of handling it
Andrew,idk i think its perfectly fine
Andrew,in the end its the parents choice
Andrew,I guess the choice of the child doesn't matter then
Andrew,"well i mean the ""child"" isnt actually like  a person yet"
Andrew,so
Andrew,they dont have one?
Andrew,It's still a living breathing human being
Andrew,Not everyone sees personhood as starting at the same time
Andrew,it's not like they can make a choice at that point in life
Andrew,i mean its not like you're offing a person who has lived a life and had experiences
Andrew,and it's basically assisted suicide
Andrew,which is a totally different argument
Andrew,that kind of makes it worse
Andrew,its like im deteling a game save that didnt have an data on it not like im deleteing a 100% completion run
Andrew,You are denying them the choice
Andrew,that I don't feel like having right now cause I'm real tired and should probably get to sleep and also I don't know my own stance on it
Andrew,Would it be sadder to see a 5 year old die who has had no chance at life or a 100 year old with a life fully lived
Andrew,"it's basically: yes you're denying them the choice, but also you're making the choice to doom them to a short life of misery"
Andrew,both of which are shitty options
Andrew,"regardless, I'm going to sleep"
Andrew,goodnight
Andrew,i mean both are about the same if you ask me?
Andrew,i mena people die
Andrew,shit ahppens
Andrew,Yeah but not always purposefully
Andrew,That's like saying it's alright if I murder my neighbour so who cares?
Andrew,well an unborn baby =/= your neighbour
Andrew,your neighbours is like actually a person
Andrew,"""people die all the time"""
Andrew,max said 5 year old vs 100 year old
Andrew,idk where that argument was going but i was answering it
Andrew,look i dont wanna argue about it cause nobody is gonna change their opinion about anything and itll just end in people being grumpy so ima drop it
Andrew,I mean we don't really get grumpy from political debates here but I understand why you don't wanna argue
Andrew,i cant tell tone is this like an offhanded roast or a genuine comment
Andrew,Genuine comment
Andrew,I don't know if everyone already knows or not but plup got into summit
Andrew,You are denying those people the opportunity to exist
Andrew,There is the potential for a life full of wonderful conscious experiences
Andrew,@Sak von Sak
Andrew,@SWIRL GIRL
Andrew,pls join
Andrew,
Andrew,I'm
Andrew,At work
Andrew,O
Andrew,Kay
Andrew,@SWIRL GIRL come play big gai
Andrew,In like 10 minutes
Andrew,Jk more like 25
Andrew,Fuck you
Andrew,
Andrew,jk tho
Andrew,
Andrew,since no one knows what time human becomes a human it's safest to assume that they are a human at conception so you can't abort anything if you could determine at what time a person becomes a person you wouldn't have this argument when we have something as valuable as life on the line i would rather be safe then sorry that's my position. @Max @Sak von Sak @Eric Working From Home @The Rona
Andrew,I think abortion should be legal up to 2500 weeks
Andrew,Yo that's 48 years
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,exactly
Andrew,Also I agree with Zain
Andrew,But in all seriousness I agree with Zain as well
Andrew,"Considering that your brain is pretty much one of the first things that begins development, I would argue you ""become a person"" pretty early on"
Andrew,i mean even if you are arguing that it is a person and not an anomaly (im probably using that word wrong) the value of a life isnt that high imo
Andrew,"An anomaly would be something that isn't standard, so I don't really know what you mean by that?"
Andrew,A fetus is a pretty normal thing
Andrew,uhh
Andrew,hello boss?
Andrew,considering a zygote contains all the information necessary for a complete human to form I think that is when you are human
Andrew,If there was a completely painless and cost free way to remove a zygote from the womb and grow it externally without harming the mother I think there becomes no moral arguement for abortion
Andrew,change my mind
Andrew,@SWIRL GIRL
Andrew,@Bitmin
Andrew,are you guys still here?
Andrew,I got yoted?
Andrew,i mean what would even be the point of going to those lengths to create a person
Andrew,That's what plan B does right?
Andrew,Because it is better to live than to never have the chance to exist
Andrew,there are so many people in the world and we are so insignificant that to think we actually matter is narcissistic and delusional
Andrew,And creating more concious minds is the moral imperative
Andrew,like if i died tomorrow would it matter
Andrew,no
Andrew,Yes it would
Andrew,Because you matter
Andrew,i care about u dober
Andrew,thats the poiont in tryna make
Andrew,nobody matters
Andrew,u matter to me
Andrew,But that's not true
Andrew,^
Andrew,Thats not true
Andrew,Every life matters. Conciousness is the only thing that matters. Maybe the universe doesnt assign us any meaning at birth
Andrew,"If you have the mindset that you don't matter, then you probably won't ever do anything that matters. But if you live your life with the mindset of doing something that matters and had an impact somewhere, you probably will achieve that to some scale"
Andrew,But it could be said that humans and more generally conscious creatures are the ONLY thing that matters

Andrew,so in DnD spiders have a strength of 2
Andrew,meaning they can life 30 pounds (reduced to 15 due to their size)

Andrew,owl
Andrew,"on friday, we had an office lunch thing where our manager took us all out for lunch, I ended up sitting next to the manager and one of the full timers and got to listen to them spend the entire lunch talking about weed"
Andrew,Is weed legal where you live?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,its legal in all of canada
Andrew,it's legal canada-wide
Andrew,but you need a license to sell it and only a tiiiiiiny handful of places have gotten some yet
Andrew,so most available weed is still illegal
Andrew,well illegal to sell not illegal to be in possesion of right?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,you can also grow your own
Andrew,how many plants?
Andrew,but only up to a maximum of like 4 plants or something
Andrew,I think in Oregon its 5
Andrew,Why would there be a plant restriction?
Andrew,my family almost ended up growing weed for one of my mum's friends who is basically incapable of not killing houseplants
Andrew,"it's basically to make it so you can't grow and sell easily, you have enough for a household who are all using but not really enough to sell it"
Andrew,or at least I think that's why
Andrew,plant restriction so the entire population of canada doesnt get addicted
Andrew,but 5 plants if a fuck ton lmao
Andrew,weed's not addictive tho
Andrew,^
Andrew,i know but
Andrew,How big is a weed plant?
Andrew,sketchy dealers will sometimes lace it with addictive stuff but if you grow your own it's just weed
Andrew,"I honestly have no idea, but I think they grow pretty low to the ground so I'd assume not big"
Andrew,"they're closer to, y'know, weeds than regular plants"
Andrew,i thought the idea is that individuals mass growing weed doesnt screw with the price
Andrew,that makes more sense honestly
Andrew,I mean oregon has too much weed now lmao
Andrew,oregon has to grow it for the other states 
Andrew,You are allowed to plants per person over 18 in a household
Andrew,oh damn not bad
Andrew,we might have been growing 6-8 plants then
Andrew,Oh the age is probably 18 to smoke there huh?
Andrew,"I would have thought 19, same as drinking age, but I dunno"
Andrew,Eief way still better than 21
Andrew,You can't even vape or smoke tobacco products till 21 in Oregon now

I've been sleeping with no clothes on for the passed few nights because it feels better and my grandpa doesn't come into my room much, so he wouldn't know. But this morning I accidentally slept in so grandpa came in to wake me up. I had morning wood (an erection in the morning that is caused in your sleep) and I had kicked the covers off during the night so I was laying there naked, with a hard-on (how embaressing!!). Grandpa quickly went out of the room and we weren't talking because it was awkward. Then later on today I was wanking off in the bathroom (which doesn't have a lock) when I thought my grandpa was outside. He walked in just as I was ejaculating and groaning with . One day doesn't get much more embaressing than that!! How unlucky. My grandpa and I haven't talked for seven hours now. What should I say to him?"

Andrew,pfft nice
Andrew,Can confirm that puff dittos are still really boring

Andrew,TAHNK YOU
Andrew,I kinda like the water one tho
Andrew,Nobody here likes my boy Grookey 
Andrew,water and fire are aight but grookey is so bad it drags htem down with it
Andrew,he's second best but not really particularly notable
Andrew,fingers crossed for kameron liking the fire one and then if we do gen 8 we all get the starter we want
Andrew,He's literally a baby monkey
Andrew,So cute
Andrew,I the the fire one too

Andrew,Report: Amazon will pay $0 in federal taxes this year
Andrew,"Amazon won't pay a cent in federal taxes this year, according to a report by a watchdog group.  The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy(ITEP) reports that Amazon, in fact, is getting a $129 million rebate, meaning they will effectively pay a negative one percent tax rate."
Andrew,Yikes
Andrew,Big business privilege
Andrew,Have not read a ton on this but I think they helped write the tax laws that made this possible
Andrew,Why do we let this happen
Andrew,Cause we don't want them moving to a different country and losing jobs
Andrew,But it's still really not a good way to go about it
Andrew,i mean it's free speech dude the speech that says heres 10 million dollars lets write some laws deff not a bribe btw
Andrew,lol

Andrew,@Homies @Eric Working From Home Just found out that tabletop simulator has a bunch of full magic the gathering sets on the workshop and I want to play the game again. Feel free to @ me if anyone wants to play.
Andrew,That'd be fun we could play like with the battledecks or have a draft/commander night
Andrew,im not huge on draft tho
Andrew,not a fan of commander but I would be down for draft or sealed
Andrew,haha
Andrew,oh lol
Andrew,We could do 6 packs from an old set
Andrew,if people play draft ill play dont get me wrong
Andrew,prerelease style
Andrew,ah okay
Andrew,never been to a prerelease
Andrew,they are fun
Andrew,I went to the magic origins one
Andrew,i liked that set
Andrew,I think that this format would be best because I doubt we will get enough for draft.
Andrew,Prerelease format works with any player count
Andrew,fair
Andrew,We could pick an old classic set like Innistrad or Zendikar
Andrew,innistrad best plane with best planeswalker as its guardian dont @ me
Andrew,My favorite set personally was Khans of Tarkir

Andrew,Will you have mega free time tomorrow?
Andrew,I'll have a computer then hopefully
Andrew,yes
Andrew,Not sure if you are interested but I would be super down to play some Magic the gathering on tabletop
Andrew,Any amount would work for sealed but we need at least 6 for a proper draft
Andrew,I don't think playing a constructed format would be a good idea
Andrew,The way magic works on tabletop would make it complicated and inconvenient
Andrew,@Zain Do you know how to play magic or would you be learning?
Andrew,I would play sealed or draft
Andrew,@deleted-role anyone down?
Andrew,"@Homies We are playing magic the gathering on tabletop simulator tomorrow. Feel free to come and join whether you have played before or are new to the game as anyone who has played can teach you before we start. For those who know what this means, we will be playing either sealed or draft as constructed is inconvenient to play on tabletop."
Andrew,why dont we just play rn
Andrew,I guess I could try on my laptop
Andrew,he has his laptop
Andrew,tabletop sim is not too resource intensive
Andrew,which is better than his pc anyways
Andrew,We could at least teach Zain tonight
Andrew,not sure if everyone would want to play on this short notice

Andrew,@Mr. Airplane of course you wanna play rivals now that I'm not at home
Andrew,I could play keyboard kragg on shitty wifi though 
Andrew,JED
Andrew,FOCUS ON YOUR PAPER
Andrew,!!!!
Andrew,Nah I'm about to finish my project
Andrew,Then the paper
Andrew,I'm also writing a paper
Andrew,The alternative energy paper
Andrew,"After researching it, I'm not really sure why people like to hype up wind and solar, as they seem like the two worst options."
Andrew,Nuclear >
Andrew,Solar efficiency has a moores law and will be superior in the coming years
Andrew,Because they are renewable
Andrew,Sure they aren't very good
Andrew,But they are effective in the long run
Andrew,I'm saying that there are better renewables
Andrew,Also solar technology will only improve
Andrew,the basic idea is that it's a one-time cost you can stick pretty much wherever
Andrew,hydroelectric is probably best but you can only stick it in certain places
Andrew,and become cheaper while still harnessing energy at a higher efficiency
Andrew,you can just shove solar panels on a roof and get a decent amount of energy
Andrew,Utilities companies will never accept that
Andrew,They will lose a lot of revenue
Andrew,they can't entirely stop you as far as I know
Andrew,They can lobby against it
Andrew,I wrote another paper on that
Andrew,even on personal property and stuff?
Andrew,damn that's dumb
Andrew,If you have solar pannels you have to sell the energy back to the grid
Andrew,"Or if you use the power yourself, and don't use the grid"
Andrew,You have to pay for the power that you would have used
Andrew,well
Andrew,that's dumb
Andrew,indeed
Andrew,I am fairely sure that is how it currently works atleast in Ontario
Andrew,Hooray for lobbying
Andrew,"I know at my house we just pay for an alternate provider who gets their stuff from renewable sources, which is an option but I don't think they generate enough total energy to supply a particularly large number of people"
Andrew,"basically we just take energy and they pump that much more into the grid (and pay a bit extra, so we also pay a bit extra)"
Andrew,lol marss camera tricked himself
Andrew,To me it looked like he did neutral B instead of down B

Boomer: lv48 Wailord (died to a crit)
Snek: lv46 Dragonite (got ice beam'd)
(also brought 3 garbo pokemon)

Progress: Agatha three mons down"
Andrew,Will Chris finally win one?
Andrew,almost certainly
Andrew,we introduced some new rules for elite four to prevent stalling and it kinda depends on how far kameron makes it
Andrew,aight chris just won
Andrew,Why would you ever want to stall in a race?
Andrew,"if everyone else loses, winning strat is to just grind till you're overleveled and then make it further"
Andrew,so we changed the rules so the first person to reach the elite four doesn't have to make it as far to win

Andrew,seems mega stupid
Andrew,Yeah but you said it took like 20 gb per hour or something crazy right?
Andrew,Supposedly
Andrew,I didn't look too deep into it
Andrew,But its supposed to stream the game from the cloud
Andrew,Which I think means it runs the game from the cloud
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,SO I think the  idea is you dont need a device to process it you can just play from anything that can stream it
Andrew,or rather you dont need a good device
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,So I found a little more

Andrew,everytime he gets a haircut it looks like its only cut back by 1cm
Andrew,kameron likes his hair long because he loses 1 cm of pingo for every 1 cm of hair
Andrew,^
Andrew,its a 1:1 hair to pingo reverse relationship
Andrew,"f(p) = p * -h
Where f(p) is a function of the relationship between
p (pingo length)"

Andrew,The open A.I bot that could produce extremely realistic written text did a debut on reddit
Andrew,It would respond to everyones comment with a paragraph of text
Andrew,"Heres what it said to me saying 
""In the beginning man made memes."""
Andrew,"OUTPUT:
The internet was meant to let us enjoy those memes because we saw them. In their mind man made memes was as much an expression of man's self to be seen as any other. This is a sad state of affairs and we see it again and again in the work of art.When a new art forms is created men take what they need to reproduce the original. They put in what they can, this will bring the art back, and this will lead to new art forms. This works like ""We need to love something and enjoy it"" but it is an extension of the original. It is the same with art.> 
This process creates new forms of artistic expression. This is what the ""songs of history"" are all about. It creates new forms of expression. I would much like to hear about these great works that are being created through this process. They are all in this world. People like you that love art will listen to the work of these artists and create a great work of work. I would like to hear about some of these great works through your community. Here's what you can do to help. Take a look. A man made meme> 
This is how the creator of these works came to get his name. This is an interesting thing. If you don't know this guy, the Internet is really the most amazing thing ever to happen to the internet. People have created a new art form to be reproduced in and around our public spaces. Now all we see is this guy being made a poster and that's it.> 
You know this meme is great and you just want to help a few people. Here are some links to help you out. This is why we are so hard at work to create the memes we deserve. If you want to know more on this and more great works about this we're here to help.> 
The Art of Making> 
And this is a must get for everyone at work. If you are one of the lucky few you will get a copy of The Art of Making. We've put together this guide to help you make sure everyone has a copy of The Art of Making. We hope it helps you too!

Andrew,I found a no kap in the wild
Andrew,safe now
Andrew,?
Andrew,spoilery things in another channel
Andrew,@Neurotic you a bitch
Andrew,jk u a nice guy
Andrew,i never understand these sentiments
Andrew,it seems like every person on reddit agrees with and spouts this garbage
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,This isn't even true
Andrew,like yeah you CAN do well with low tiers
Andrew,People be dumb
Andrew,but it PROBABLY WONT BE FUN
Andrew,Falco laser spam is arguably better at low level for example
Andrew,YOUR CHARACTER LITERALLY HAS LESS OPTIONS
Andrew,= LESS FUN
Andrew,also most people probably consider winning kinda fun
Andrew,the second part of this post just isn't even true
Andrew,"most people can identify what makes a character good pretty easily, even people who don't understand the game"
Andrew,"ie chrom kills early and is fast, ylink has projectiles"
Andrew,But Kirby cant die 4Head
Andrew,I built a machine learning pipeline that can predict with 70% accuracy how many defects one of the parts we are going to produce will have
Andrew,Feelsgoodman
Andrew,Whats everyone up to these days>
Andrew,?
Andrew, 
Andrew,Wrote a lab report on the BMR of mice
Andrew,We is BMR?
Andrew,Big Mega Roast?
Andrew,Basal metabolic rate
Andrew,What were the conclusions of your lab results?
Andrew,Basically how much energy your body needs to run at rest
Andrew,A mouse uses about 7.625cal/hr/g
Andrew,So 7.625 calories per hour
Andrew,per gram of body weight it has
Andrew,How does one calculate these metabolic rates?
Andrew,In laymans terms please
Andrew,❤
Andrew,"I'll tell you later, I'm in my lab now"
Andrew,@here how do i get rid of this bullshit in the corner
Andrew,No idea it seems like a new 'feature'
Andrew,hover over it
Andrew,and there should be an X
Andrew,in the corner
Andrew,THERES NO X
Andrew,then you lost gg
Andrew,guess im just gay
Andrew,problem solved guys
Andrew,its a bug
Andrew,not a feature lol
Andrew,Too bad you have the gay now
Andrew,@SWIRL GIRL ive got that shit too
Andrew,howd you fix
Andrew,prob just restart ?
Andrew,i didnt fix it
Andrew,waiting on discord to fix it
Andrew,Results from survey
Andrew,n = 91 (so far)
Andrew,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot surgeon to perform a critical surgery. (Heart Transplant, Gastric Bypass, Spinal Poliomyelitis Surgery, Surgical Ventricular Restoration ETC...)"
Andrew,
Andrew,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot to perform basic Nursing duties (pre-post operational care, taking: pulses, temperatures, blood pressures, monitoring and administering medication and intravenous infusions)"
Andrew,
Andrew,Do you feel an Artificially Intelligent Robot could provide emotional support during recovery?
Andrew,
Andrew,Do you think a ban should be placed on Artificially Intelligent Robots preventing them from entering the healthcare workforce to prevent medical professionals from being ousted from their jobs?
Andrew,
Andrew,Would you trust the diagnosis of an Artificially Intelligent Doctor?
Andrew,
Andrew,Looks like I was in the minority for those last three
Andrew,It appears the general consensus (If this sample is representative at all) is that a reasonable portion of people are comfortable with SOME form of A.I assistance in healthcare
Andrew,same
Andrew,for what chrius said
Andrew,@Trapezoider I think a resonable interpretation of this data would be if A.I assistance in healthcare was proven to be a benifit based upon evidence people would be comfortable in using it on themselves that's why a mojarity would say maybe i think
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,What
Andrew,There isn't really enough data on this for people to have informed opinions
Andrew,"For me, as someone who knows how far the academic research has advanced, I can see how application of A.I is superior in many different medical domains  when compared to the best human Doctors. For the layman however, they don't have knowledge of the ground breaking developments  to answer these questions knowledgeably"
Andrew,yea i think the reason there are so many maybes is because either the data is not there or people don't know enough about the data
Andrew,yea exactly
Andrew,that's why i think if people knew what maybe you did there would a lot more yes's rather then all the maybes but i could deff be reading a lot more into the data then i should be
Andrew,I think the sample size is too  small to be too confident in our answer
Andrew,"As far as sample sizes go, this is pretty good"
Andrew,i mean this is deff not a good representation of the population my dude at least not this server
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,Im gonna see if I can send it to people at work
Andrew,I could easily get 800 responses from this plant alone
Andrew,I think of all the questions a consensus should be reached about the first question. Human Surgeons make mistakes and some of those mistakes are sometimes fatal. It would be universally better to have ai or nano bots or whatever performing that part of the medical process. Thats the part people fuck up the most on lol\
Andrew,Agreed
Andrew,Now the A.I community needs to figure out how to explain to the public the work they are doing
Andrew,It should be simple lol guess not
Andrew,It's not simple to explain this stuff in a way that people trust
Andrew,unfortunately the reason for that is cause generally people are uneducated on the subject
Andrew,Even though I'm demonstrating empirically superior analytics at my Internship (compared to our business analyst team) I am encountering strong opposition to Machine Learning
Andrew,Precisely
Andrew,It's gonna take a lot of time to shift the zeitgeist on this issue
Andrew,Thanks Alot Stephen Hawking scared everybody in the 90s
Andrew,@Trapezoider stop using big words u stupid idiot
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,ya dumb
Andrew,^
Andrew,but like unironically using words like that makes you sound like you carry around a pocket thesaurus
Andrew,He does
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,Its some fucking r/iamverysmart shit
Andrew,I think that was an appropriate use of the word for the actually meaning that would not have  a good substitute to get his point across
Andrew,"""zeitgeist"""
Andrew,how bout popular opinion
Andrew,actually zeitgeist does not even make sense in that context
Andrew,because it refers to something from the past
Andrew,and this is the present
Andrew,so popular opinion actually makes way more sense
Andrew,^
Andrew,
Andrew,It doesnt only apply to the past lol
Andrew,Did you read the definition at allÉ
Andrew,?
Andrew,well we don't know what the zeitgeist of the current time is until the current time is over so it kinda does
Andrew,I cant read
Andrew,
Andrew,"also the word is usually used to refer to historic timeframes, example ""the 60s"""
Andrew,Reading hurt my pee pee
Andrew,"""demonstrating empirically superior analytics"""
Andrew,this just word salad
Andrew,I dont wanna get hung up on semantics but and im not saying the way he said things was good or bad but i think it is fine to use big words to describe specifics if it makes sense
Andrew,im just saying that if you talk that way dumb people are gonna think you're smart and smart people will probably think you're dumb
Andrew,Fair
Andrew,"I just hate the negaive look on ""big words"" use them if you can and they make sense"
Andrew,i would change that to use them if you need to for it to make sense
Andrew,'big words' typically will have very specific use cases
Andrew,Or just don't overuse them in everyday speech
Andrew,using them whenever you can will make your speech more confusing
Andrew,Like an essay or a paper etc.
Andrew,even then
Andrew,But it real life its like trying to up the word count
Andrew,you shouldn't use big words in a essay just to sound smart
Andrew,you should use them if they're meaning aligns with the message you are trying to convey
Andrew,In an essay big words can be used effectively to describe the 'seriousness' of the situation
Andrew,eh
Andrew,But again there's a limit to that
Andrew,i dunno about that
Andrew,Just don't overdo it
Andrew,Hey Kameron
Andrew,How about you eat cock
Andrew,there is a difference between big words and formal language
Andrew,Zeitgeist was the appropriate word
Andrew,Literally false
Andrew,it clearly wasn't
Andrew,
Andrew,Read it and weep
Andrew,It clearly was
Andrew,"""Current believes and ideas of the time"""
Andrew,of the time
Andrew,i.e.
Andrew,The past
Andrew,2010's is a time period
Andrew,I am conducting this survey now to see how things evolve over time
Andrew,"yeah but its not even a ""defining spirit or mood"""
Andrew,10 years from now the zeitgeist around A.I and A.I in healthcare will be entirely different
Andrew,fear of ai is not a defining spirit of the 2010s
Andrew,Yeah but we as people in the present have a poor understanding of the majority consensus on topics
Andrew,It is in my circles
Andrew,Fear of A.I is one of the most discussed topics of the people I work and hangout with
Andrew,My intellectual life is dominated by this topic
Andrew,Man andrew you're really smart
Andrew,Man Kameron you're a really big asshole
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,Ill make that asshole gape a little wider
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,"But Kameron, what I was saying about big words in an essay was essentially the idea you said"
Andrew,"I'm sorry if you feel I'm tossing together a word salad, but this is the world I live in. Bullshit meetings and emails and fucking retarded standardization of everything"
Andrew,I just didn't know how to express it
Andrew,hence the quotations around the word seriousness
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,Everyone at work ACTUALLY emails and talks like that
Andrew,Andrew have you heard of the theory of great filters as connected to the Fermi Paradox?
Andrew,Yes I have
Andrew,I think it is entirely likely that surviving AI could be the final filter that nothing passes
Andrew,Maybe A.I is the bottleneck that prevents most civilizations from becoming intergalatic
Andrew,This is why I'm entering the field. I want to ensure we build safe A.I and don't destroy everything we care about
Andrew,I think that's the idea
Andrew,We develop alternate realities
Andrew,That we live in entirely
Andrew,i.e. they are so advanced that we think it's reality
Andrew,eg. the Matrix
Andrew,That we kind of just forget about progression and stuff
Andrew,Who knows where all this is going
Andrew,All bets are off the table
Andrew,"Go read Perfect State by Brandon Sanderson, it's basically that idea"
Andrew,Sorry let me phrase that in words kameron will like
Andrew,Also its only like 60 pages
Andrew,I think that finding and increasing the genetic basis for IQ in humans would be a far safer approach to increase our scientific progress then creating AI.
Andrew,all gambling activities have after careful consideration been labeled not available as actionable items in the workplace environment
Andrew,?????????????????????????????
Andrew,That's what I call a fucking word salad
Andrew,much better
Andrew,holy shit
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,I disagree
Andrew,It's an interesting take on how a matrix-like system could work in a way beneficial to the happiness of mankind but at the cost of other stuff and all around its a solid story
Andrew,"Andrew, what is your view on transhumanism?"
Andrew,I don't think you can get enough of an increase in intelligence from using CRISPR to edit genes. Brains are about as big as they can be due to birth canal size. I think the way to go is high bandwidth brain interfaces. A third neo-cortex in the words of Kurzweil
Andrew,"I think transhumanism is dogmatically adhered to too much, especially by silicon valley type people. Transhumanism is a good goal to aim for, but with some asteriks* to ensure we don't accidentally destroy ourselves (genetically engineering superhumans---->super bug that wipes out everyone etc..)"
Andrew,I'm off lunch break boys. Have a nice day. Thank you for keeping my mind busy with fun discussions ❤
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane @The Rona  I think that when ever your trying to communicate with people it's probably more importent that the people you're communicating with understand the message you want to convey over saying it as efficetly as possible. If we work off this premise then the best way to communicate is to use words that almost everyone will understand thus making your message hopefully easier to understand for the people your communicating with agreed?
Andrew,zain ur late we already finished this discussion

Andrew,wow the voices in this game are actually obnoxious
Andrew,"these are probably the worst characters, voice-wise"
Andrew,or maybe I'm just used to being annoyed at them cause I play both of them
Andrew,"Whenever I play ultimate with Ava or with her in the room, she always comments on how annoying Ike is because he makes so many war cry type noises."
Andrew,ike's voice is way better than this
Andrew,that is true
Andrew,^
Andrew,i think if I had to listen to those voices for 5 minutes i would blow my brains out
Andrew,they're not that bad
Andrew,they're like the two worst anime voice archetypes
Andrew,true
Andrew,extremely squeaky little girl and edgy man child
Andrew,@Homies come chill
Andrew,there was some debate in the queen's fgc discord over who the edgiest character in the game is between that guy and this dude:

Andrew,2 hours of sleep over the last 36 hours. Check in isn't till 4 so we are derping around
Andrew,"Should we go to universal studios, SeaWorld,  or disneyworld"
Andrew,??
Andrew,Universal studios is also pretty sick
Andrew,They got some nice rides
Andrew,Universal is the best of those three options
Andrew,"You gotta go to adventure Island though, that's where the better rides are (it's a part of Universal studios)"
Andrew,Also it's the one with Hogwarts
Andrew,^
Andrew,adventure island is really cool
Andrew,the main park is more movie focussed while adventure island is more ride focussed
Andrew,^
Andrew,but I agree its probably the best of the three
Andrew,honestly disney is kinda boring and its usually mad crowded
Andrew,If you like roller coasters
Andrew,Adventure Island has probably one of my favourites
Andrew,in the Hulk ride

Andrew,it's really good
Andrew,?
Andrew,eaten raw whipped cream
Andrew,What is the difference between that and regular whipped cream?
Andrew,it hasnt been cooked
Andrew,"I'm pretty sure he either means
a) non-whipped cream that you're supposed to whip, or
b) just straight whipped cream without putting it on anything"
Andrew,
Andrew,I have done both of these things
Andrew,the first was honestly much less exciting than the second
Andrew,i think @Trapezoider was referring to whipping cream which is hella gross to drink and is not the same as whipped cream
Andrew,whipping cream > raw buttermilk
Andrew,especially if you're not expecting the buttermilk
Andrew,So
Andrew,Did you drink whipping cream
Andrew,just a bit
Andrew,or just whipped cream by itself
Andrew,stop drinking things alone that are supposed to be ingredients in other things
Andrew,I have done some terrifying things with whipped cream
Andrew,

Andrew,"Zack should be happy, Mewtwo is probably the most buffed character of the patch."

Andrew,"so yesterday at work I was talking about danganronpa with one of the other interns, and I tell him that I've been taking a bit of a break from danganronpa 3 cause I'm pretty sure at least one of my favourite characters is gonna die and I don't feel like going through that right now, he asks me who my favourite characters are, I tell him my two favourites, and on the second one he literally goes

""Oh I remember when he dies!""

I'm now playing again and man just died."
Andrew,i bored
Andrew,I'm down to do stuff once I'm through this bit of danganronpa
Andrew,that'll probably be at least an hour though
Andrew,You favorites always die
Andrew,"yes, they sure do"
Andrew,I still have one left
Andrew,and they are extremely suspicious
Andrew,This is why you don't tell people who your favorite characters are
Andrew,If your favorite doesnt die then you cant pick good characters to favorite
Andrew,Sylki that's so bm of that guy what the heck !! So much for a spoiler alert
Andrew,yeah kinda
Andrew,"it totally is, I'd be mad"
Andrew,oh I am
Andrew,"but also that whole chunk of the game I played today was really, really good"
Andrew,so I'm less upset than I was before just cause it put me in a better mood
Andrew,even though one of my favourite characters died
Andrew,ooh that's a nice way to look at it
Andrew,also I would have been more upset if the character hadn't been raising death flags left and right for 90% of the game
Andrew,I just kinda assumed he wasn't gonna make it and honestly I'm shocked he survived this long
Andrew,haha just don't get attached to characters like that
Andrew,you can't just not get attatched to characters
Andrew,danganronpa's good at what it does
Andrew,no I'm joking I feel ya
Andrew,i should probably play that at some point

1) I should just run back instead of shielding all the time, running backwards is really good
2) I need to focus more on not getting hit
3) I think when I am at mid percents I go  for risks thinking I won't die but characters in this game can kill at like 0 so I should stop doing that"
Andrew,All solid points
Andrew,@Ultimate anyone down?

Andrew,"find something that suits the mood you're looking for - a lot of people go for intense stuff to hype themselves up, I go for more chill stuff to keep myself from getting titled or overly aggressive, it kinda depends what you're looking for"

Andrew,Just become a teacher
Andrew,Factz
Andrew,Summer for the rest of your life
Andrew,"maybe, but also no"
Andrew,
Andrew,kids are terrible
Andrew,No money lel
Andrew,If teaching payed better I totally would do that
Andrew,it pays well in canada
Andrew,I really enjoy teaching people things
Andrew,Maybe in the states you don't make a lot
Andrew,I would totally do adjunct professor ship
Andrew,"not obscenely well, but pretty damn well"
Andrew,Canada is real good
Andrew,But getting tenure is hard AF
Andrew,you can also teach grade school
Andrew,easier to get into
Andrew,kind of
Andrew,I would want to teach highschool
Andrew,cause at least in toronto the teacher's union is a mess
Andrew,Fuck elementary
Andrew,I remember I once wanted to teach english
Andrew,and then I started editing people's essays
Andrew,Gg
Andrew,and I realized I could not look at high school-level essays for the rest of my life
Andrew,I also realized that basically no one cares about english in high school
Andrew,Gotta hit up that math / science
Andrew,I've peer proofed some of my friends work before and holy hell some people don't know how to write/spell
Andrew,"we got to choose from a huge number of damn good books to read and do a few essays on, including Oryx & Crake and Watchmen, I think other than a few people who read Watchmen because comic book I was the only person in the class who actually read the book"
Andrew,which our teacher was well aware of and kinda roasted people for which was funny
Andrew,but they can't actually do anything about it
Andrew,and I think as a teacher I wouldn't take that very well
Andrew,"In my English class, we have to do peer review for every essay and after peer reviewing 6 essays I can agree that most people don't know how to write. What amazes me is when people don't even properly follow the assignment instructions."
Andrew,yup
Andrew,most people consider english a filler course and don't bother putting in anything more than the minimal required effort
Andrew,What's funny is how much they are gonna get fucked for that poor skill
Andrew,More than math I have to write so many proposals and emails
Andrew,Well I try to get an A in everything. Both because it makes getting in to the school you want more likely and I'm just a tryhard at everything by nature.
Andrew,Not being able to take control of the written word is such a burden
Andrew,2 years into college and I still have a 4.0 
Andrew,I've ended up being saddled with handling like all the writing for all the interns at my office
Andrew,As long as I get above a b I don't really care but when it comes to my job I'm a tryhard
Andrew,I don't even understand half the stuff I'm doing write ups for
Andrew,"That is with a math every year, 2 Biology courses, and 1 chemistry course."
Andrew,If only jobs check GPA
Andrew,he's going for actual college tho
Andrew,which sure as hell check gpa
Andrew,"I also am going to try for a scholarship to save my parents $25,000"
Andrew,that too
Andrew,man US college is pricy
Andrew,FactZ
Andrew,that's almost as much as my 4-year degree plus four years of housing (including the very pricy year in residence with a meal plan)
Andrew,Yaw bruh
Andrew,actually since it's in USD it's probably more
Andrew,Im lucky I got 2 years free
Andrew,My community college is like $900 as semester though so that's pretty cheap
Andrew,yeah but it's community college so you kinda get what you pay for
Andrew,"Professors are a mixed bag. I've had some great ones and some terrible ones. Student body is what you would expect from the price, most people seem far below my social class."
Andrew,Lmao imagine having your parents paying for your college
Andrew,They planned on doing it so why would I complain?
Andrew,technically my grandpa's basically paying for my education cause he left a ton of money for it in his will but he's still alive so he's just kinda paying most of it now anyway -_-
Andrew,I'm not planning on going to a 4 year school anymore
Andrew,also most people can't afford to put themselves through college on a part-time job
Andrew,especially not in the US
Andrew,"What are your plans, Jed?"
Andrew,Too fucking expensive even with a bunch of scholarships
Andrew,"Prolly community college, I'm not sure if I'm gonna stay at home or move somewhere"
Andrew,just come to canada for school
Andrew,although we do charge extra for foreign students so it's probably not much cheaper
Andrew,I might try and learn a trade or something not totally sure yet
Andrew,I could have a job with John deer in Montana if I wanted to move out there
Andrew,ok I just checked and international students pay like triple the domestic tuition
Andrew,maybe don't come to canada for uni
Andrew,at least at queen's
Andrew,"it's like:
one year of eng degree, domestic: 7k
one year of eng degree, international: 23k"
Andrew,That's about as much as my future school I think
Andrew,the domestic or the international?
Andrew,Yeah that's about the same as gcu before scholarship
Andrew,International
Andrew,^
Andrew,oof
Andrew,Gcu was gonna end up being 11k a year
Andrew,Too many people go to college anyway
Andrew,"that's eng tho, which is one of the pricier ones"
Andrew,I think that only smart people who care about learning should go
Andrew,"If you are just going to go, get C's, and skip class a lot why bother?"
Andrew,C's get degrees
Andrew,"cause the degree makes it easier to get a job, and as the saying goes, ""C's get degrees"""
Andrew,dammit chris
Andrew,you beat me
Andrew,Maybe post-acceptance they do
Andrew,For me I still need the A
Andrew,What do you call the guy who got a C in medical school?
Andrew,A doctor
Andrew,Doctors
Andrew,Exactly
Andrew,Why get an A when I can get B's and C's and earn money while going
Andrew,Being in Machine learning means I have to keep up on scientific papers and research constantly
Andrew,My education doesn't end in college
Andrew,I was mainly saying I wish college was less essential for life so it could be an option for smart people to specialize in a technical field.
Andrew,I mean it's not gonna matter in 30 years
Andrew,None of us are likely to be better than computers at anything
Andrew,Good luck getting a science job on a high school degree
Andrew,max that's what non-undergrad degrees are for
Andrew,I know
Andrew,College is still a minority pursuit
Andrew,The average person doesn't attain higher education

Andrew,Big protein
Andrew,Large aminos
Andrew,I hope you all are doing well
Andrew,:-)
Andrew,Today is kind of a work mess
Andrew,"At like 5 my manager gives me a task, passes me over to another guy to get more details. From the details I realize any solution like what he wants is gonna be extremely gross code. I do a bit of experimenting and realize there is no way to do it without rewriting a huge portion of the backend, so I ask both the guy who explained what I should do and my manager for clarification. Both had since left the office and gone offline on slack. In desperation, I reach out to the other guy who knows about the bit I'm working on (who is literally on his way to the airport) to ask for help, he suggests a less awful solution, I go ""great, but I don't have access to that code, can you give me access?""  That was fifteen minutes ago. He is presumably busy doing real life things and will not be getting back to me. This was implied to be a somewhat urgent task."
Andrew,-- Tldr -- I'm kinda fucked because I got an urgent convoluted task and i don't have access to the code and everyone who might be able to help is gone
Andrew,Pinned a message.

Andrew,marss loss to mkleo was very sad bois

Andrew,Is the stream lagging a bit for you guys?
Andrew,not really
Andrew,nairo what
Andrew,you just won with wolf
Andrew,what are you doing
Andrew,wat
Andrew,WHAT IS GOING ON?????!?!?!?
Andrew,nairo how did that just work
Andrew,this is gonna be a wack vod
Andrew,"Marss (ZSS) vs Nairo (ZSS, Wolf, Robin)"
Andrew,HOLD THE FUCK UP
Andrew,HE WENT DARK PIT
Andrew,RANDOM SMASHER
Andrew,how does he look so serious
Andrew,MARSS IS LOSING STILL??
Andrew,my best guess is he's feeling like mars figures out his characters later in the game but he's winning cause he gets an early lead so he's just swapping every game?
Andrew,but like wtf nairo
Andrew,you go down 0-2
Andrew,fucking
Andrew,500 iq
Andrew,"switch to wolf, win"
Andrew,"switch to robin, win"
Andrew,switch to dark pit for game 5
Andrew,NO WAY
Andrew,lol
Andrew,what was that
Andrew,aight marss figured it out at the end
Andrew,but honestly whaaaaat
Andrew,Pit is so bad
Andrew,alright marss is my favorite player but.......
Andrew,he still almost got it tho
Andrew,NAIRO IS INSANE
Andrew,like that was still really close
Andrew,this tourney is mega hype
Andrew,salem beating dabuz with shulk
Andrew,real question tho
Andrew,like
Andrew,why no palu
Andrew,mkleo's sick joker
Andrew,marss is very up vs nairo's palu
Andrew,tweek vs mkleo winners finals
Andrew,hot damn this man's joker is nuts
Andrew,mkleo is crazy
Andrew,I'm loving the fast fall upair regrab shenanagins
Andrew,well i guess this tourney isn't hype anymore
Andrew,mkleo's pretty nuts I dunno
Andrew,mkleo just gonna stomp peeps
Andrew,tension = 0
Andrew,true
Andrew,unless somehow marss gets into grands
Andrew,but it's still hella nice
Andrew,i dont think anyone else can beat leo
Andrew,samsora always loses to leo and tweek just got bodied
Andrew,I feel like tweek could try some other characters and he might have a chance
Andrew,dunno how matchups gonna work
Andrew,
Andrew,loving these town and city games
Andrew,
Andrew,stage variety 4head
Andrew,lets just remove all the interesting and distinct stages
Andrew,ike pog
Andrew,I'm focusing so hard on this match
Andrew,Have to study both sides
Andrew,the best players of max's two characters
Andrew,except leo i guess
Andrew,they're actually both playing super well
Andrew,this is a great set
Andrew,I'm better at down throw follow ups then mars lol
Andrew,He missed some easy ones
Andrew,"roy might be a wacky weight for it, I'm not sure"
Andrew,he's a weird weight for a lot of things
Andrew,tweek is getting demolished
Andrew,That was brutal
Andrew,if only marss beat tweek so that this set could have been close
Andrew,nvm
Andrew,im loving the dynamic between the top players in ultimate

Andrew,JP
Andrew,I assumed so
Andrew,What a cool that man is

Andrew,Bruh
Andrew,:-(
Andrew,Wait if that was the whole conversation then he totally in the wrong

Andrew,@Homies How is website? http://pathtoneuralink.com/
Andrew,Pretty sure this is an error
Andrew,
Andrew,????
Andrew,THAT IS STRANG
Andrew,I am seeing that too
Andrew,
Andrew,@Zain
Andrew,What is causing this
Andrew,is it the '
Andrew,it happened on the bottom too
Andrew,that is so weird
Andrew,Its wherever I use apostrophe or quotes
Andrew,Hmm
Andrew,Let me bugfix
Andrew,I've seen this before on my poorly designed home school website. I'm not sure how to fix it but I'm pretty sure that its replacing non-letter characters like ' with stuff.
Andrew,Looks like I have to use the unicode character for apostrophe's and quotes
Andrew,@Sak von Sak Is that my problem?
Andrew,it shouldn't be a problem but it depends how you've put together the non-html parts of the website maybe
Andrew,it can't hurt to unicode it
Andrew,I have no backend
Andrew,Its all shiny sauce
Andrew,is your front end just raw html & css?
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,weird
Andrew,Bootstrap for the navbar and footer
Andrew,Font awesome
Andrew,Simple stuff
Andrew,"something weird is going on with the formatting, I'm looking at it in chrome dev tools and there's a lot of weirdness"
Andrew,No don't roast my code
Andrew,does this happen locally?
Andrew,
Andrew,no like the way chrome is interpreting it is weird
Andrew,What am I looking for?
Andrew,"just, if you test this code not in the site does it have the same problem?"
Andrew,no
Andrew,Well
Andrew,I don't know now
Andrew,Because I unicoded everything
Andrew,it might be something weird with whoever's hosting it
Andrew,Dreamhost
Andrew,They are freaky
Andrew,but also I don't know why you have quotes in your <p> tags
Andrew,it shouldn't be necessary
Andrew,uhh
Andrew,I dont
Andrew,That is weird
Andrew,Wait
Andrew,"<p """">"
Andrew,"or <p>

STUFF
""""

</p>"
Andrew,the second
Andrew,oh
Andrew,"<p>
""
stuff
""
</p>"
Andrew,"should just be
<p>stuff</p>"
Andrew,I wrote all the P tag content in a word document and probably put unecessary quotes
Andrew,Any other tips for formatting stuff?
Andrew,I can't tell for sure cause what I'm seeing isn't your actual code
Andrew,just how chrome is parsing it
Andrew,Problem has been resolved
Andrew,Thanks unicode
Andrew,it's still weird that it was happening in the first place
Andrew,Yeah I looked in my code
Andrew,I didn't put quotes inside my p tags
Andrew,Chrome is weird
Andrew,or dreamhost has HIV
Andrew,probably dreamhost

Andrew,losty by 1
Andrew,It was
Andrew,rip
Andrew,106-105
Andrew,wow close
Andrew,The raptors missed 9 points in the last minute
Andrew,Then the last shot of the game that could have one it
Andrew,Was nowhere near the basket
Andrew,Literally hit it off the backboard
Andrew,Why don't they just split the game into 5 quarters instead of 4 and play best of 5 quarters. That would make more of the game feel impactful.
Andrew,Too bad these sports are too established to ever make a common sense change like this.
Andrew,i was tryna trade with some guy in PoE but he was speaking korean so i got my korean speaking friend to help me

Andrew,Got
Andrew,a god damn
Andrew,shift
Andrew,we all said yes
Andrew,@Homies Road Trip! we getting the whole gang together to go fight @Zain
Andrew,What a great idea to spend time with the boys
Andrew,And fuck @Zain
Andrew,what did he do
Andrew,"We start with picking up me then we cross the border to get kameron then we cross the border to pick up schlef then we cross the border to get jed and andrew then we cross the border to get chris then we cross the border to get smithy and karina then we cross the border to get zack then we cross the border to get max and ava then we cross the border to fight fusion then we cross the border to go to LAX to all fly home, we're leaving hte car there"
Andrew,That is the worst route lol
Andrew,it is optimal for border crossing
Andrew,What do you mean?
Andrew,Why are we doing this
Andrew,Can you come up with a better one?
Andrew,Also come get me
Andrew,Me and chris are basically next to each other
Andrew,because zain is a raidboss so we need to get the entire party together to combine our strength
Andrew,maybe they want a long road trip for fun uwu
Andrew,okay because zack complained i have cleaned up the route
Andrew,Yes that's much more sane
Andrew,okay but why in the first place
Andrew,why are we fighting zain
Andrew,i need to throw hands with zain
Andrew,he knows what he's done
Andrew,and i need my team to back me up
Andrew,
Andrew,It's only like 3.5 days of continuous driving
Andrew,So practically about a week
Andrew,i prefer the 2 weeks of continuous route
Andrew,oh then we gotta get back
Andrew,so double it
Andrew,What happened to ditching the car at LAX?
Andrew,witht he optimal route we dont do that
Andrew,Ah
Andrew,So it's time & distance efficient but not cost because we lose the cost of the car
Andrew,Probably a van actually
Andrew,We are taking Mike's 5 seater
Andrew,Its gotta fit like ten of us tho
Andrew,we will strap yall to the top
Andrew,
Andrew,Are we doing this?
Andrew,I am so down
Andrew,I'll help pay for gas 
Andrew,
Andrew,Guys can we please do this
Andrew,even distribution its about $500 a person
Andrew,Uhh
Andrew,uh
Andrew,
Andrew,4200 miles / 300 miles per tank = 14 fillups
Andrew,we but we renting an rv
Andrew,to fit everyone
Andrew,14 fill ups x 12 gallons  per gillup = 196 gallons
Andrew,4 dollars per gallon x 196 gallons = $784
Andrew,/ 7people = $74 per person
Andrew,How much is an RV rental?
Andrew,yeah but we renting an rv so at 100 a night figure 3 weeks thats 2100 plus its not as fuel efficient as your estimate
Andrew,all these numbers are calculated with the route where we ping pong across hte country and go over hte border 9 times btw
Andrew,Lol No!!!
Andrew,XD
Andrew,Don't use that route
Andrew,Take the optimal one
Andrew,nah
Andrew,What's even the point if we don't use the non-optimal route
Andrew,I CANNOT AFFORD THE SUB OPTIMAL ROUTE
Andrew,sub optimal route or we walk
Andrew,Bet

The reason for this will become apparent once it begins. For now, all you need to do to help me prepare for this event is to post the names of things you like (probably around 5-10 things would be the best number) in the submissions channel. You can post anything, from something as vague as ""history"" to as specific as ""pizza""."
Andrew,@The Rona I'm down for OoT randomizer

Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,@Meetup Created a role for @ing meetup related people. I gave this role to everyone who will possibly be there. The official days for the meetup were decided yesterday as July 19th (Friday) to July 29th (Monday). The airport Chris's dad would like people to fly in to is Toronto Pearson (YYZ). If anyone has a problem with these days please let us know soon so we can possibly make slight adjustments before I buy my plane tickets.
Andrew,is it okay if i fly into Hamilton Regional (HAM)?
Andrew,You literally live there dude
Andrew,You can but you would have to walk over
Andrew,F
Andrew,ac work
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,Fighting Game Controller Tier List
Andrew,I almost agree with this
Andrew,"But I would at least put the power glove up to A, maybe even S"
Andrew,maybe swap the power glove and the vive?
Andrew,Due to how easy it is to control
Andrew,N a h
Andrew,just
Andrew,bump the glove to A tier
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,Like top of A
Andrew,
Andrew,Ok looks good now
Andrew,I would reverse this and move the wii remote and it would be perfect
Andrew,you really think fighting your opponent IRL should be 2nd bottom tier?
Andrew,tbh I had no idea what that picture meant
Andrew,it means clocking your opoonent in the jaw so you are the only remaining fighter
Andrew,honestly that strat is pretty foolproof
Andrew,and its a controller cause you control who actually is able to play
Andrew,s tier free
Andrew,Yeah but the one drawback it has is that it only works during lan
Andrew,Because of that I think it deserves the A spot
Andrew,Mmmmm you could just swat them
Andrew,Would that count as it's own thing though?
Andrew,Or an extension of fighting them
Andrew,I would
Andrew,i would
Andrew,"@Meetup Tickets purchased! People Currently confirmed: Max, Chris, Zack, Benson, Devon. Pending: Andrew, Kameron, Jed. Definite NO: Zain, Smithy, Ava. Toronto Frostbite meetup 2019 is looking to be very good."
Andrew,Anyone in need of a passport should take care of that as soon as possible
Andrew,
Andrew,Excited
Andrew,take me off hte list
Andrew,i aint going
Andrew,oh okay
Andrew,im starting my own meetup
Andrew,
Andrew,with blackjack and hookers
Andrew,you know what
Andrew,forget hte hookers
Andrew,ill be in devon's pool
Andrew,the meetup is exclusively in my pool
Andrew,once you enter
Andrew,you cannot leave
Andrew,put me down as a definite yes for dober's sick pool meetup
Andrew,
Andrew,Aw hell yeah
Andrew,
Andrew,How are you going to play Blackjack in the pool though
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,already got it covered
Andrew,Fuck
Andrew, flight would only be $500
Andrew,And passport is like 100 I think
Andrew,@Max what other things would I need to account for costwise
Andrew,uhhhh
Andrew,It'll probably depend on if I can take a week off work
Andrew,We are staying at Chris's house
Andrew,Food/activities?
Andrew,I'm not really sure how much of that we need to buy
Andrew,Chris should tell us how much his planned activities cost
Andrew,@Jed Want the meetup role for regular updates and access to the meetup planning channel?
Andrew,Yee
Andrew,I'ma try and make this work
Andrew,Work will be my only problem I think
Andrew,I'll go and revise my earlier message
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane if I end up going to the Meetup and you don't I'll fly to Maryland and tell you that I'm disappointed in you
Andrew,Oh shit
Andrew,Jed coming now too hopefully
Andrew,
Andrew,I have the money it's all about my work
Andrew,Try to book it off right now
Andrew,Cause I just started last week and I'm already taking a week vacation this week
Andrew,oh
Andrew,You can do it
Andrew,I believe
Andrew,Sending positive vibes in your direction
Andrew,I'm not a super essential part of the farm yet like I'm just an extra pair of hands
Andrew,So hopefully 
Andrew,farm?
Andrew,And honestly this Meetup is probably more important to me than this job
Andrew,Yeah I work on a farm now
Andrew,what kind of farm
Andrew,like whats growing
Andrew,the devil's lettuce
Andrew,
Andrew,Yeah we grow hemp
Andrew,But it's also a dairy and other crops
Andrew,oh shit dawg
Andrew,Literally every farm in Oregon is growing hemp cause it's the only place you can
Andrew,Also there's a chance I'll be able to get a day or two off during the meetup bit I'll have to ask pretty far in advance so if we could figure out which days would be best ahead of time thatd be good
Andrew,The meetup has been decided as July 19th to 29th
Andrew,@Max cs?
Andrew,^
Andrew,Sure be there soon
Andrew,@Sak von Sak We should probably be able to work around whichever days are easiest for you
Andrew,They'll all be about equal except some Wednesdays and Thursdays
Andrew,@Cs:go
Andrew,@Max join up dork
Andrew,I meant more for events that I normally wouldn't be able to join cause they'd be during work
Andrew,
Andrew,Joined the server.

Andrew,@The Rona that's your house right
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,I might be fucked passport wise
Andrew,Just get it now
Andrew,
Andrew,It can take like 2 months to get though

Andrew,I have a valid passport card
Andrew,So idk if I just need to renew and get a book or apply for a new one
Andrew,NO passyport here :/

Andrew,chris when down?
Andrew,cause i ain't staying up late anymore
Andrew,don't think I want to
Andrew,why not 
Andrew,The amount of time required to be good enough at a game to have fulfilling speedruns of it is time I would rather spend doing other things.
Andrew,i dunno about that tho
Andrew,i feel like once you pin down the necessary tech runs should be pretty fulfilling
Andrew,I ain't staying up late anymore either

Andrew,Yeah learners permit maybe not ok but the other stuff on the list is
Andrew,Just get your license idiot
Andrew,Also I don't think in gonna be able to make it @Max it's a little too last minute
Andrew,
Andrew,The passport would cost like 250-300 to get on time
Andrew,you could also just go without
Andrew,it'll take a little longer but iirc they just ask you questions
Andrew,also if you were tryna fly to toronto i thought you needed ur passport anyways

Andrew,@Homies games?
Andrew,
Andrew,@Ultimate I did a thing
Andrew,
Andrew,By popular demand
Andrew,dont agree with g&w especially with that frame three upb out of shield
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,

Andrew,=
Andrew,
Andrew,"For those who didn't know, Ally (28) has been exposed for being in a gay relationship with Captain Zack (a MINOR) and has now retired from smash. Let him never return and hopefully go to jail."
Andrew,"Uuuh you're missing some important parts, cause I'm pretty sure it was technically legal age-wise (just extremely, extremely sketchy), the real issues from what Ive heard of the situation involved physical and sexual assault"
Andrew,"So yes, hopefully he ends up in jail"
Andrew,But hey at least this isn't like the Nightmare situation where it was technically legal and he had tons of people on his side
Andrew,But he'd basically forced a 16 year old to date and sleep his 24-year-old self
Andrew,At least people are pretty universally against ally
Andrew,(Also tbh it's weird to me that you focused on the gay part rather than most of the actual problems)
Andrew,(Most people already knew that they're both gay)
Andrew,"Aight I looked into it a bit more and apparently the assault stuff was exaggerations and theorizing, so that's less bad at least"
Andrew,Still creepy borderline pedophilia and I'm glad its come out and that ally is retiring
Andrew,But he's not gonna end up in jail cause it was technically legal
Andrew,Max doesnt care if it was legal
Andrew,pride month is over
Andrew,     
Andrew,that makes me sad. ally was such a good player
Andrew,"I wouldn't say I focused on the gay part at all, I just mentioned it for those who might be unaware. I literally capitalized the word minor to avoid this problem and show the area I was emphasizing. But I guess people would read it that way anyway because its me. Just to clarify, no, I do not think gay people should go to jail. I was referring to the fact that he was dating an underaged person."
Andrew,yeha i agree with max there it didnt really seem like he focused on it more like an offhand comment
Andrew,"I mean a) you started with gay, which is usually an emphasis thing, and b) it has no bearing on it being problematic and the phrasing makes it sound like you're giving it roughly even billing with everything else. I get that it wasnt intentional but also given your general opinions it doesn't necessarily come across as such."
Andrew,"Well, sorry if you took it the wrong way. Maybe I should have left out that detail entirely given my history."
Andrew,Also there's a bit of an issue with people who do equate homosexuality and pedophilia so its definitely somewhere to watch your phrasing for potential misinterpretation
Andrew,"I definitely see a difference considering one is consensual and I only object for religious reasons, which you may not agree with but I hope you at least understand. While the other is taking advantage of a difference in intelligence and being a predator."
Andrew,"Was basically making sure there wasnt a misunderstanding, and also at the time I thought there had also been assault which I thought was more important to mention"
Andrew,gamers rise up and join vc im lonely
Andrew,In short: poor communication kills and we both didn't do a great job

Andrew,Isn't that the guy Zain always mentions?
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,his whole brand is debating dumb people
Andrew,which as a concept is already pretty trashy
Andrew,Mob Psycho 100 season 1 finished. Totally not for me but I get why its popular. 6/10
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane many people today believe in some pretty crazy ass shit he does debate these crazy people. If he or other people like him waren’t to do this they could and would push there agenda and make more “crazy” people and so thats why its good that he can will and has debated these crazy people. On the topic of likeabilty this is entirly subjective so if you don’t like hin alright cool i guess.
Andrew,wow dude i didn't realize that destiny was so heroic
Andrew,truly the savior of our generation
Andrew,"hi man i'm just addressing the points you brought up. i wake up and i see my lord and savior destiny chan being insulted can't believe this, but in all seriousness he's not a nice person to any extent but the reasoning you brought up for not likeing him is pretty week"

Andrew,The old testament or the Torah as the Jews call it.
Andrew,the asnwer was exodus
Andrew,Oh you meant like that
Andrew,I thought you meant more generally
Andrew,wouldn't that make the bible the bible part 2
Andrew,and the book of mormon the bible part 3
Andrew,That would be the case if a Jew is the one answering

Andrew,NEURALINK UPDATE [OFFICIAL]
Andrew,"This is not a Path To Neuralink episode. This is my take on an official announcement from Neuralink. At around 6:50pm 7/10/2019, Neuralink announced via Twit..."
Andrew,Alright question time
Andrew,Is it rude to make a phone call on a bus
Andrew,Not is it allowable but is it impolite
Andrew,It depends on how loud you are being
Andrew,Like if you are asking everyone on the bus to quiet down so you can hear
Andrew,That's rude as hell
Andrew,But if you've got earbuds in or something
Andrew,You good
Andrew,???
Andrew,How do earbuds change anything
Andrew,I don't know how to explain that any other way
Andrew,Also obviously emergencies are exempt
Andrew,I think talking on the phone on a bus is obviously rude
Andrew,People just don't understand the concept of public spaces
Andrew,What's the difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you?
Andrew,I don't think that talking to someone next to you on the bus is polite either
Andrew,But...
Andrew,I mean
Andrew,Just don't be loud
Andrew,One could argue that talking on the phone is more avoidable
Andrew,I mean for you to be heard in a bus or metro you gotta talk kinda loud
Andrew,This is why earbuds are effective
Andrew,You should be able to hear them without problem
Andrew,And you don't have to talk as loud if you speak directly into the microphone of the earbuds
Andrew,"I feel like if you try to keep the conversation to a minimum we good, but if you're voluntarily entering a conversation that's pretty rude"
Andrew,It's a matter of respecting public space
Andrew,I guess
Andrew,Ok both of you are wrong how is talking to the person next to you rude and how is talking on your phone rude and obviously I'm talking about at a respectable volume
Andrew,if you think talking on the bus is rude ur a bitchass
Andrew,Dude that's literally my argument at the beginning
Andrew,Just keep it at a respectable volume
Andrew,if someone on a bus talks so loud to the point of a problem someone will tell them to shut up
Andrew,Bro if you guys don't understand the significance of the discussion you're so obviously part of the problem
Andrew,My argument is that people fail to respect public spaces
Andrew,our argument is that the discussion has no significance
Andrew,Yes if you just circumvent the entirety of my argument obviously I appear to be wrong
Andrew,if youre bothered by people talking in a public space then you have the problem not the speaker
Andrew,public spacws arent inheritly silent
Andrew,Respect public spaces people can still talk to each other and respect the people around them
Andrew,I agree with boi Greg
Andrew,yes zain that's true but again that's not really my point
Andrew,also greg
Andrew,'s argument is actually braindead
Andrew,YOU CAN'T CHOOSE TO BE IN A PUBLIC SPACE OR NOT ITS NOT YOUR FAULT IF ITS UNCOMFORTABLE
Andrew,???
Andrew,that actually makes zero sense to me
Andrew,BRO IF YOU DONT LIKE  RACISM JUST MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE
Andrew,4HEAD
Andrew,
Andrew,I gotta say this is a mess
Andrew,thats not a good comparison tho
Andrew,racism is a real issue people talking on a bus is a mild annoyance at best
Andrew,I don't see how talking in a public space is a problem
Andrew,i mean the conversation was fine until these two bozos just lack the understanding of what's being discussed entirely
Andrew,ok does people talking in class bother you
Andrew,what about a library
Andrew,not really
Andrew,If I'm riding the bus with a friend are we both supposed to just sit there in silence?
Andrew,Kameron
Andrew,^
Andrew,also just because it may not bother you it can bother others
Andrew,Wait stop those are completely different spaces
Andrew,That's what I said
Andrew,Those are terrible examples
Andrew,that too
Andrew,Both with existing expectations of quietness
Andrew,A bus is not a silent space
Andrew,Those comparison are so bad'
Andrew,ok but there aren't many other public spaces
Andrew,the park
Andrew,Cause in a class you're supposed to listen to a teacher
Andrew,the street
Andrew,"its not a matter of does it bother me, its about respecting the wishes of others"
Andrew,And all libraries have rules against it
Andrew,In a public space that has no predetermined rules of being quiet
Andrew,But how do you know it bothers them
Andrew,u can talk as you like
Andrew,the street does not fit into the way we are using 'public space' here
Andrew,This clearly something you think
Andrew,BUSES ALSO HAVE RULES AGAINST TALKING ON THE BUS YOU MORONS
Andrew,???
Andrew,they literally do
Andrew,Not the buses I'm on
Andrew,Likewise
Andrew,if you really are causing serious trouble for someone then they have to notify you to stop or just deal w it
Andrew,Also ive never heard of a bus with talking eules
Andrew,its not a matter of serious trouble its a matter of respect
Andrew,Kameron I want your source
Andrew,What the fuck kind of buses do they have where you live???
Andrew,its not a rule as in if you break it you're removed
Andrew,Respect towards who
Andrew,i can confirm busses here have no such rules
Andrew,but a lot of busses have signs that say to keep noise to a minimum
Andrew,bro where
Andrew,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/bus-commuters-hold-all-calls-or-else/
Andrew,"Bus Commuters Hold All Calls, or Else"
Andrew,"On some New Jersey commuter buses, cellphone use is banned. But some passengers defy the rules and make business and personal calls, which leads to confrontations with drivers and other riders who demand quiet."
Andrew,"Yeah there's a difference between a conversation and what they're talking about, which is stuff like yelling or blasting music"
Andrew,Ok that's wack
Andrew,Thats siper weird lmao
Andrew,2008
Andrew,why new jersey gonna have some rule like that when like
Andrew,And I've never seen anything like that anywhere I've been
Andrew,proper cities with populated transport dont
Andrew,That's interesting by that I mean retarded
Andrew,There's literally no difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you
Andrew,Again
Andrew,Just keep it respectable
Andrew,yes chris I agree
Andrew,Also this article is from 2008
Andrew,ok ill admit its the first thing i found
Andrew,but you guys were like: 'this doesn't exist'
Andrew,it definitely exists
Andrew,but you probably have not looked for it
Andrew,well everything probably exists but a exception does not make the rule
Andrew,this is the same argument as sniffling during a test
Andrew,it simply demostrates a lack of understanding that your actions may impact others around you
Andrew,Sniffling is uncontrollable tho its totally not
Andrew,false
Andrew,you can
Andrew,Wait what
Andrew,bring a tissue
Andrew,wipe your nose on your shirt
Andrew,Sniffing is deffinitly controllable
Andrew,Just wipe your nose
Andrew,ask to go to the bathroom
Andrew,if a tissue isnt provided or if you forget then what
Andrew,wipe your nose on your shirt
Andrew,thats actually nasty
Andrew,imagine getting upset at people sniffling
Andrew,
Andrew,Mike
Andrew,"Shut up, whore"
Andrew,
Andrew,so mad
Andrew,realize that you are sick and then should bring a tissue for your test
Andrew,Just dont be sick
Andrew,
Andrew,plus a test still has an expectation of quiet so sniffling is still.more severe than talking on a bus
Andrew,its not a matter of severity my guy
Andrew,A bus has no expectation of quiet
Andrew,ok that's just raw false
Andrew,so there is no reason to assume people want quiet
Andrew,if someone wants quiet then its their job to ask for it
Andrew,if someone played their music on the bus without earbuds would people be annoyed
Andrew,NO ITS NOT
Andrew,in a library its different
Andrew,you shouldn't have to ask others to be respectful
Andrew,if someone plays music such that its annoying then just tell them to stop
Andrew,yes but that doesn't mean its rude in the first place
Andrew,Its not disrespectful to not assume people want quiet
Andrew,*not rude
Andrew,Greg is totally wrong here
Andrew,^
Andrew,You just shouldn't blast music out of your phone on the bus
Andrew,well no you shouldnt
Andrew,Nobody wants to hear that shit except for you
Andrew,because loud music is always annoying
Andrew,It is though
Andrew,"but talking on a bus isnt usually annoying, especially at a reasonable volume"
Andrew,yes we all agree
Andrew,If it doesnt cause problems in general then why is it suddenly disrepectful
Andrew,that makes 0 sense
Andrew,because using the condition reasonable volume inherently means that what you are doing isn't disrespectful
Andrew,"again, your example is unrelated to the argument"
Andrew,If you want silence in a place that does not demand silence then its not everone elses job to know you want solence
Andrew,??????
Andrew,Ur arguement is also totally related
Andrew,im actually done discussing this with someone who clearly doesn't even understand the issue
Andrew,breakfast time
Andrew,You cant just say theres an issue and assume i will accept that
Andrew,you have to establish the problem first
Andrew,he said no and left
Andrew,bruh i told you its breakfast time
Andrew,i already said why its a problem
Andrew,I dont assume everyone is going to be quiet unless its a place like a library
Andrew,I dont think its rude for people to play music in public
Andrew,Kameron your argument is actually retarded. People pointed out a valid flaw and you moved the fucking goal post
Andrew,@Homies game time
Andrew,@The Rona 
Andrew,Certified gamer moment
Andrew,@Trapezoider i see what you mean and ur probably right i think how i phrased the initial question was not what we ended up discussing tbh
Andrew,but yeah my initial take was overly spice
Andrew,im gay
Andrew,yikes
Andrew,thats pretty gay
Andrew,also chris apparently investigations have a better chance of the odogaron gen
Andrew,I already got the gem
Andrew,Also Gavin was the one who typed that message

Andrew,Highly recommend

Andrew,Money joon
Andrew,@Max agreed I finished it like two weeks ago
Andrew,h e c k  y e s
Andrew,1000000/10
Andrew,Rise up gamers
Andrew,Shows fucking excellent
Andrew,Can't wait for season 4
Andrew,
Andrew,Its labeled as the final season if you were not aware
Andrew,No
Andrew,Not facts
Andrew,I looked into this
Andrew,
Andrew,Straight from myanimelist
Andrew,https://www.google.com/amp/s/screenrant.com/attack-titan-season-3-game-thrones-mistakes/amp/
Andrew,Attack On Titan Is Making The Same Mistake As Game Of Thrones
Andrew,"Game of Thrones rushed its ending, now Attack on Titan is doing the same."
Andrew,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1148984/Attack-on-titan-season-4-release-date-cast-trailer-plot-when-is-attack-on-titan-out/amp&ved=2ahUKEwjN6YPQhK7jAhVGIDQIHUifCbEQFjALegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw0J1Soh4WbfKnbZkWHLrajo&ampcf=1

Andrew,You are wrong
Andrew,There's still like 50 chapters of manga
Andrew,
Andrew,I don't think that matters
Andrew,This season could be long
Andrew,also manga chapters are short
Andrew,MAL only posts verifiable information
Andrew,like most manga I've read where I've also seen the show it's usually like 2-5 chapters per episode
Andrew,(5 is usually for fights where the action that takes up a lot of panels takes not a lot of screen time)
Andrew,Wow so that wouldn't even be a full 12 episodes at 5 per episode
Andrew,(it's usually closer to 2-3)
Andrew,@Ultimate ultimate?
Andrew,Max season 3 part 2 is over
Andrew,I know that
Andrew,The show has another season coming
Andrew,Next summer
Andrew,Yes that is what I was saying
Andrew,Omg
Andrew,4head
Andrew,Also its October
Andrew,WHAT
Andrew,no tis july
Andrew,its october
Andrew,YO THATS WAY SOO ER
Andrew,@Feral Nebula FACTZ?
Andrew,yes
Andrew,NEXT October
Andrew,^
Andrew,at least for now
Andrew,2020
Andrew,because AOT has a track record of changing plans
Andrew,so don't count on it one hundo percent
Andrew,They may want to time the manga and anime to end at the same time to maximize sales
Andrew,@Max @Sak von Sak ultimate?

Andrew,I made the comeback though so its fine
Andrew,last few minutes of D&D then sure
Andrew,I'll join after getting some food
Andrew,I also discovered a really cool pika edgeguard where you drag down with fair and then footstool. I have no idea if I could repeat it consistently but it was so cool. Gimped a mario at like 60%.
Andrew,lol fiction's DI is so bad
Andrew,melee looks so much worse without slippy
Andrew,
Andrew,He is using all the wrong moves
Andrew,"Max, you didn't deserve that GSP anyways, Pika is annoying
~ Benson probably"
Andrew,Pikachu is so much fun
Andrew,i dont hate max that much
Andrew,to say shit like that
Andrew,I like Pikachu too
Andrew,tweek game 5 vs a brawlhalla player monkaW
Andrew,Who?
Andrew,sandstorm
Andrew,Wrenched
Andrew,Oh
Andrew,
Andrew,Who does the brawlhalla guy play?
Andrew,he's playing ken
Andrew,ken is busted
Andrew,Ken seems pretty good
Andrew,I've always been a Ken believer
Andrew,Ken got buffed
Andrew,He used to be terrible
Andrew,I stand by what I said
Andrew,Imagine wearings knee wraps when squatting less than 135
Andrew,I don't even know what analogy to give to explain how stupid this guy is
Andrew,It's like spending $1000 on a custom GameCube controller for your first tournament
Andrew,Smh
Andrew,Maybe he has weak knees
Andrew,Nonono
Andrew,Not those type of knee straps
Andrew,I'm talking knee wraps that apply so much force on the lower half of the squat that your legs can do nothing BUT GO UP
Andrew,
Andrew,Meant for guys to squat 800 lbs
Andrew,Very bad for the knees
Andrew,
Andrew,Maybe he's just weak as fuck
Andrew,And needs those to lift
Andrew,4head
Andrew,That's not how dis work
Andrew,@Master Memers TF2

Andrew,because twitter sucka da large pp
Andrew,Nestle’s children companies
Andrew,@Master Memers TEAM FORT LATER
Andrew,Yes Sir
Andrew,Wizzy just won the smash 64 major
Andrew,Zain 4 stocked Hbox
Andrew,zain 4-stocked hbox
Andrew,woah
Andrew,
Andrew,If you watch Leffen's restream he is pointing out all the stuff Hbox is messing up. Its actually really funny how much stuff he gets wrong but doesn't get punished for because he is puff.
Andrew,hbox bad
Andrew,leff man real good
Andrew,Hbox's DI is actually so bad
Andrew,'dreamland isn't a free win for puff' is such a pepega opinion
Andrew,alright puff is the best character in the game im down
Andrew,especially in b05
Andrew,Welcome to the club
Andrew,marth #2
Andrew,b05 actually favors puff and marth so hard
Andrew,Having a free win is nice
Andrew,It sure would be good if we had a ban... 
Andrew,it actually makes viewing melee so much less fun
Andrew,Ultimate is over an hour late lol
Andrew,Puff is so interesting
Andrew,I'd never thought id see the day where i was waiting for another smash game bored outta my mind watching melee
Andrew,The ruleset needs to be updated to reflect the new meta
Andrew,Make Melee Great Again
Andrew,"Ban wobbling, ledge grab limit, bans in bo5"
Andrew,100%
Andrew,At least ultimate nerfed Olimar
Andrew,Olimar being not as good makes the game so much better to watch
Andrew,ultimate meta is kinda neat
Andrew,the problem is that the boring matches in melee are also alot longer than the hype ones are
Andrew,Banning puff would make the game more interesting
Andrew,so like 3 boring matches in a top 8 takes up half the time
Andrew,... or more
Andrew,unfrozen stadium 
Andrew,Why are they good for bo5?
Andrew,"anyone: lands 1-2 hits
toph: THATS BIG DAMAGE"
Andrew,Bo5 has no stage ban. Puff and Marth each have a stage they are massively favored on vs most characters.
Andrew,I dont like toph
Andrew,hbox di lol
Andrew,Pepelaugh
Andrew,sad
Andrew,pillowpet guy pog
Andrew,DALLAS LUCKY
Andrew,I feel like I'm listening to a conversation of exchange students ^

Andrew,twitch chat can probably claim to be a proper dialect at this point
Andrew,4 people on commentary is too much
Andrew,especially when 3/4 aren't very good
Andrew,alright scratch that it's 3 commentators the 3 not good ones

Andrew,is 15 all there is? I don't want a repeat of yesterday
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,get devon to send the picture at some point before i finish if you guys want it in the video
Andrew,So my parents are selling our house
Andrew,And the real estate agent came over
Andrew,but I didnt know that
Andrew,So I walk out of the bathroom
Andrew,Oh pog they are moving in with you
Andrew,In nothing but my undies
Andrew,
Andrew,Thats a way to meet someone
Andrew,Nah
Andrew,They arae moving north
Andrew,@Trapezoider you got an apartment already?
Andrew,yessir
Andrew,when are you moving into it?
Andrew,also I'm sorry to disappoint but I just can't do the daily vlog today
Andrew,i can throw it together if you want but I seriously can't take anymore of this meme editing right now
Andrew,or maybe not even that why is this taking so long to accomplish nothing
Andrew,I'm so irritiated
Andrew,I don't want to do this anymore
Andrew,Don't blame me when there is no vlog today
Andrew,
Andrew,hey
Andrew,don't be mean to me
Andrew,you guys are putting pressure on me to spend hours of my day everyday making dumb memes
Andrew,it's starting to stress me out
Andrew,
Andrew,get devon to do it like he originally was
Andrew,Devon is here though
Andrew,We have no way to edit
Andrew,uhghdughudfhgksjdfskldjf
Andrew,maybe I'll try again later
Andrew,I still need that photo of the bathroom and the video from Benson
Andrew,"but probably no more memes tomorrow. Don't expect too much, it really does take a lot of time. (also I might be busy all day the 24th and 25th)"
Andrew,okay well this one is done. I'm rendering it rn. I didn't do either of Benson's requests both because the first one took too much editing and the second one bc I never received the clip for it.
Andrew,Just to make a statement if you guys really need me to I can continue editing the clips together if for whatever reason none of you can but the fancy editing and memes will be minimal from here on out because this is taking upwards of two and a half hours everyday and it's really draining. glad you guys enjoyed the memes while they lasted though.
Andrew,i enjoyed it for the first two days but its just too much im sorry

Andrew,how much does fighter pack cost?
Andrew,25 dollars yikes
Andrew,That's for everyone though
Andrew,yeah but i thought that hero only costs 6 dollars
Andrew,so it'd be cheaper to buy 4 characters
Andrew,and then not buy banjo cause he looks dumb
Andrew,
Andrew,real talk you'd probably still save money cause most tournaments give you a discount for bringing a setup
Andrew,and not having all the characters means they can't use your setup
Andrew,Yeah but Kameron dumb
Andrew,i dont really want tournies to use my setup cause then i'd have to stay there after going 0-4

Andrew,then we play mhw
Andrew,but then the day after i get back i go to new york for a splat lan
Andrew,We can play tonight tho
Andrew,"Random idea: Settlers of Catan could be made into a more consistent game by replacing the dice with a deck of cards with the numbers 1-12 on them. The deck would have the same number of each number as that number has dots on the board. For example, there would be one card with ""2"" and one card with ""12"" while there would be five cards with ""8"". The deck would be completely drawn through before reshuffling. This would ensure players get the exact return they should on their investments into certain tiles and would eliminate a lot of randomness from the game."
Andrew,doesnt that give a totally unfair advantage to the person selecting second
Andrew,since the second person geenrally had the best choices overall for picks
Andrew,I don't think this change would give an unfair advantage. There will be games where the person who picks good tiles will get an even bigger advantage if they get lucky with rolls and games where they do very poorly because of bad luck. The first scenario is unfun because that person is highly likely to win and the second is unfun because that person is just losing to luck. My rules change would just balance out the outliers and make the game more dependent on skill.
Andrew,"Ultimately managing resources based on luck is a type of skill, vs knowing ""oh i have a sheep coming so I dont have to do anything"""
Andrew,It also makes player trading worthwhile

Andrew,"just sorta show up whenever, Kameron's finishing an OW game"
Andrew,"I really dislike the design of the Hero. Random crits, random down B, random move on the down B, instant kill. Whyyyyyyyy"
Andrew,@The Rona WOAH I HEARD U WAS TALKING SHIT
Andrew,the hero sounds lit
Andrew,what are you talking about
Andrew,random crits?
Andrew,that's my jam
Andrew,DansGame
Andrew,i love being rewarded for being bad
Andrew,"Max, you listed the same point twice"
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,ima be back in 10
Andrew,ima leave in 10
Andrew,"@The Rona Those are two different reasons. The down B is inherently random by selecting 4 moves. One of the possible moves to get is a move that does something completely random, even potentially harmful to yourself."
Andrew,I forgot about that one
Andrew,But also
Andrew,Just don't pick that one
Andrew,
Andrew,Guys I lost my gf and I'm scared
Andrew,There's a homeless person yelling next to me
Andrew,Hlp
Andrew,where are you ??

Andrew,Mewtwo buffs
Andrew,
Andrew,also the fuck is this
Andrew,world's least relevant nerf
Andrew,LOL
Andrew,Actually useless
Andrew,Another patch of my characters not being changed
Andrew,Works for me
Andrew,What projectiles even do 50% ???0
Andrew,Probably items/already reflected projectiles
Andrew,I'm just greatful that they didn't destroy him
Andrew,it might just be cause it lasts so long that you can double reflect with a single input?
Andrew,but that's still... kinda dumb
Andrew,Tetracon last long but not that long though
Andrew,mebe
Andrew,"still, I'm hyped about zard getting buffs to ftilt, fsmash (like it wasn't already hella strong when you hit it??), longer-lasting nair, and a stronger fthrow"
Andrew,i can confirm that hero is retarded
Andrew,but super fun
Andrew,imagine slower robin with killpower
Andrew,i think hero is mid high tier
Andrew,once people learn the matchup
Andrew,joker still best character in game
Andrew,watching more gameplay of zero kicking ass
Andrew,i no longer think he's mid high tier
Andrew,i think he's high high tier

Andrew,ok i made this cause im bored
Andrew,you are underestimating accelerate
Andrew,but good tier list
Andrew,9/10 would agree
Andrew,i also think snooze is A
Andrew,accelerate just too fast
Andrew,speed is usually good but you simply go too fast for it to be useful
Andrew,snooze is mega slow
Andrew,and thus more situational
Andrew,snooze gives you free kill and you can throw ppl into it
Andrew,because its slow
Andrew,"also, if you can control accelerate it scary"
Andrew,Yeah but Hero's grab sucks ass
Andrew,"""if you can"""
Andrew,not sure if its really even feasible
Andrew,7/10 times i see kameron use snooze it does something stupid
Andrew,also i can control it
Andrew,That's because it is almost never the correct option to use it
Andrew,it's not that hard
Andrew,And the times where you do use it
Andrew,It was the correct situation to do so
Andrew,Conformation bias
Andrew,"yea, yea, conformation bias with kameron's tierlist too"
Andrew,i mean in all fairness
Andrew,the reasoning behind all of the a and s tier spells is that they are consistently very useful in most situations
Andrew,except for magic burst which is just ridiculous in certain situations

Andrew,also meetup japan 2020? we goin to evo japan boys
Andrew,anyone wana watch top 8 with me?
Andrew,boys boys boys boys
Andrew,circular television. my new latest idea.
Andrew,TV's used to be round
Andrew,
Andrew,are you saying like miniature imax?
Andrew,boys boys boys boys
Andrew,spherical television my grand newest idea
Andrew,no
Andrew,terrible idea
Andrew,^
Andrew,come watch evo with me
Andrew,top 8 starting
Andrew,I don't know if I've ever seen a smash tournament do winner's side top 8 before loser's side
Andrew,they've been doing it all day
Andrew,it is a bit weird but it's an evo thing I guess
Andrew,This is the first I've watched of evo
Andrew,this year
Andrew,Last 2 days were lan night + practice for it
Andrew,i want raito to lose because duck hunt is lame
Andrew,duck hunt is so interesting
Andrew,he's not lame
Andrew,eh I kinda like raito's duck hunt
Andrew,he's got super neat setups
Andrew,also this is some hella mediocre commentary
Andrew,basically nothing but play-by-play
Andrew,yea this commentary is trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Andrew,imagine having evo top 8 and not bringing in the full blast zone 
Andrew,What is the full blast zone?
Andrew,"ee, tk, coney"
Andrew,tricast
Andrew,they have better commentators for the in-arena stuff
Andrew,tk d1 ee
Andrew,"not the best there is, but still better than this"
Andrew,like both cinnpie and coney are good commentators
Andrew,but they fill very similar roles
Andrew,eeeeeeeh they're not great
Andrew,but yeah definitely part of the problem is that they're both doing nothing but play-by-play commentary
Andrew,"no analysis, nothing about player mentality, etc"
Andrew,i'm so bored
Andrew,by this commentary
Andrew,it's great if you want to do something else and just listen tho lol
Andrew,not for top 8
Andrew,it was a joke
Andrew,that you don't need to watch cause you can just listen
Andrew,r/woosh
Andrew,and they'll tell you everything that happens
Andrew,fuck it im watching evo in japanese
Andrew,ok japanese commentators are so much more entertaining
Andrew,especially when you can make out a few words
Andrew,thank you anime
Andrew,tweek's PT is so nice
Andrew,^
Andrew,his zard looks so awkward tho
Andrew,but then it goes so hard with the baits
Andrew,his baits are so good with zard
Andrew,how are they more entertaining when you can only understand like 5 words
Andrew,"1, i can consintrate on the game more
2, the commintatiors react better"
Andrew,ah
Andrew,ayy smash 4 combos still works with fox? i thoiught they removed thoes
Andrew,"some do, some don't"
Andrew,i thought fair to upair didnt work anymore
Andrew,no idea
Andrew,it might be a 50/50 now
Andrew,also lucina lookin clean
Andrew,rip light
Andrew,proto's looking super good tho
Andrew,zackray leo for 7th monkaW

Andrew,yeah
Andrew,those were super fun
Andrew,speaking of we should also play rivals more
Andrew,Would we include a nerf mechanic like character banning to encourage less skilled players to attend?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,that's what I meant by like our old RoA stuff
Andrew,thumb wrestling tourney
Andrew,
Andrew,if I can get my adapter working with RoA I'm totally down to keep playing it

Andrew,lmao
Andrew,Japan is west of the US
Andrew,"yes, but it's still called the east"
Andrew,don't ask
Andrew,These terms are from Europe
Andrew,Max likes Japan better than the USA
Andrew,the east is just extra west 
Andrew,
Andrew,The terms are from the perspective of Europe
Andrew,lol
Andrew,Nope
Andrew,"Japan west, change my mind"
Andrew,do you guys wanna all watch together?
Andrew,thats why im in here
Andrew,Japan is an honorary western country
Andrew,no one is joining pepehands
Andrew,I would rather watch alone
Andrew,same personally
Andrew,"I'd be down for stuff after, but also I'll probably just pass out cause it'll be late"
Andrew,i see how it is q.q
Andrew,zard's so gross I love it
Andrew,he was at like 45%
Andrew,he was at 50
Andrew,close to 70
Andrew,so 60
Andrew,i can math
Andrew,i'm asian
Andrew,ayo commentators not knowing how many jumps zard has
Andrew,this is why im watching the japanese dub
Andrew,do you know why tweak dropped wario?
Andrew,He thought wario struggled too much at approaching and thought PT fit his style better
Andrew,ah
Andrew,i can see that with wario
Andrew,I just remembered I got 13th at a brawl major
Andrew,what a game
Andrew,Out of how many entrants?
Andrew,39 lol
Andrew,and I got a bye cause one of my opponents DQ'd
Andrew,"still, 13th at a major that was my first brawl tournament, with the second worst character in the game"
Andrew,also I love how all these 'blast to the past' clips are just a great reminder of how much better of a spectator game ultimate is
Andrew,Also just a better game
Andrew,"yeah, but especially from a spectating perspective"
Andrew,the gap there is bigger than the gameplay gap imo
Andrew,imagine looking at smash 4 with rose tinted glasses
Andrew,Smash 4 summarized
Andrew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJfLLhnvrWE
Andrew,Super Smash Bros. - Bayonetta Victory Theme (HQ)
Andrew,The victory theme for Bayonetta in Super Smash Bros 4. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS. IT BELONGS TO NINTENDO.
Andrew,doesn't rose-tinted imply I'm looking at it as if it was better?
Andrew,r/woosh
Andrew,Just counted and apparently I've mained 12 characters throughout my time playing ultimate.
Andrew,Benson being unclear and then doing r/woosh when I'm confused is not clever
Andrew,This grands should be cool
Andrew,i'm rooting for tweak only because he's the underdog
Andrew,I like Leo's style better so I'm for him
Andrew,and yes zack it's implying that smash 4 was better
Andrew,leo's style is closer to mine
Andrew,so i might pick up joker and learn some stuff
Andrew,I'm rooting for tweek cause PT
Andrew,WHAT
Andrew,"neither has an evo yet, right?"
Andrew,pt tmight be the best character
Andrew,"""PT isn't top tier"" ~Zack"
Andrew,lol
Andrew,I'm reconsidering that position
Andrew,lol
Andrew,I still think PT isn't the best
Andrew,but I'm not as sure as I used to be
Andrew,"top tier is something like peach joker pika lucina PT, no idea about the order"
Andrew,at least prepatch
Andrew,we'll have to see how things shake up postpatch
Andrew,You forget Palu and Snake
Andrew,i dont think palu is top 5
Andrew,He said top tier not top 5
Andrew,oh
Andrew,tweak is so fkin good
Andrew,YO
Andrew,*leo
Andrew,LEO'S NUUUUUTS
Andrew,What a come back
Andrew,mk is so fkin good
Andrew,also joker busted
Andrew,cabbage dog
Andrew,reverse 3-0
Andrew,tweek looked bad that game
Andrew,I think he's shook from the three stock comeback
Andrew,shit lookin like me vs zack when i read all his tricks
Andrew,poor tweak
Andrew,OHHHHHHHHHHHH
Andrew,if that hittttttttttttttttt
Andrew,TWEAK
Andrew,Tweek not tweak
Andrew,"he went too deep and basically got hit with the ""well I guess I'm fucked eithe way, might as well"""
Andrew,benson pls
Andrew,what max said
Andrew,I don't think that was intentional
Andrew,tewwk
Andrew,It was totally intentional
Andrew,I mean the sideb was
Andrew,but I don't think he wanted to be in the position where he had to go for it
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,its over
Andrew,yea leo has momentum
Andrew,tweek won two games
Andrew,then mkleo's on five straight
Andrew,I saw that
Andrew,yeah yeah
Andrew,also I'm gonna crack up if the last game of the biggest smash tournament ever is to the tune of route 209
Andrew,ill be a miricle if te\wk
Andrew,fkit
Andrew,typing is hard
Andrew,twerk
Andrew,joker's recovery is stupidly good
Andrew,the japanese commentators ask what happened to tweak
Andrew,tweek*
Andrew,he was doing so well
Andrew,poor tweek
Andrew,ggs
Andrew,hot damn
Andrew,that was nutty
Andrew,tweek almost stole it lol
Andrew,Great grand finals
Andrew,that was a good grands
Andrew,wow dude he looks so emotional 
Andrew,can we talk about that loser's run from mkleo tho
Andrew,that was like eight or nine sets
Andrew,wow that was a good guess
Andrew,"it was literally 8 people, 9 sets if you count grands as two sets"

Andrew,some beef went down
Andrew,it basically went down like this
Andrew,Game 1 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is behind the whole time but makes a comeback with vine whip) Game 2 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is winning but chokes and loses) Game 3 (PT vs Hero: Leffen wins fairly convincingly)
Andrew,sasuage man went to go say hello to the big leaf

Andrew,no meme
Andrew,also zain just looked so defeated after game 2 ended
Andrew,man poor amsa has to fight falcon right into peach
Andrew,that said he did 3-0 s2j so we'll see how this goes
Andrew,there are too many lame characters in melee
Andrew,matches like yoshi peach and puff marth are too slow for a top eight
Andrew,yoshi vs floaties is fairly boring
Andrew,yoshi is boring when amsa is losing and is thus forced to camp
Andrew,he honestly does the same stuff hbox does but amsa is more likeable so people dont care
Andrew,also it looks cooler
Andrew,in all fairness tho llod is the one camping
Andrew,llod zain losers semis maybe
Andrew,none is sick

Andrew,tier 2 is shit tier
Andrew,It's in reverse
Andrew,"6 is higest, 1 is lowest"
Andrew,you buffoon
Andrew,Who tf counts up
Andrew,These people
Andrew,the game is designed so you can play multiple heroes aslong as their tier adds up too 6 or less
Andrew,
Andrew,I just played better then I think I ever have in Ultimate. I was 3 stocking or nearly 3 stocking everyone I met in elite smash.
Andrew,pog
Andrew,"@Ultimate After years of research, I present to you my Ike matchup chart. Note: I've only played some of these matchups a single digit number of times so they may be wrong."
Andrew,Ike doesn't have a plus 1 against cloud
Andrew,I just suck at edge guarding
Andrew,Plus i have blade beam
Andrew,That can kill you at zero
Andrew,On top of that i have a better neutral
Andrew,Cloud has a plus 1 against ike
Andrew,I also think ike loses to pit
Andrew,Eeeeh I dunno about that
Andrew,Nair oos hits ike
Andrew,That can lead to fair and boom offstage
Andrew,Plus arrows
Andrew,Dead ikr
Andrew,Nair oos wont hit unless crap spacing by ike
Andrew,It can also antiair him
Andrew,Also that combo only works at low percents
Andrew,Also only preemptively cause he outranges and outspeeds pit
Andrew,If you can get him off stage its doable but its super hard to win neutral at all
Andrew,And he gets more off any given neutral win
Andrew,Ike pit is such a fun mu.
Andrew,Idk bout dark pit
Andrew,It's worse cause bad arrows
Andrew,So he kinda just has no place where he can wreck ike
Andrew,He just sorta loses all the time instead of just most o the time
Andrew,Im pretty sure fair beats his quickdraw
Andrew,Imo pit ike is 55 45 respectfully

Andrew,lightning fast rounds
Andrew,You will need to refresh the page each time the round advances
Andrew,"@Homies @Master Memers @Advanced Memers My voting bracket is finally here, featuring all of your finest submissions! I will be posting a link to the bracket both here and in the voting bracket channel. A challonge account is required to vote so make sure you get one of those. Don't worry, they are really easy and quick to make. Each round will be available for an indeterminate amount of time, so make sure you vote whenever you can. I will advance the round whenever it seems like everyone who would vote, has voted already. I have given a new role to everyone who gave suggestions in the submissions channel that I will use to update you guys on the progress of the voting bracket. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, remove the role from yourself. Alternatively, if you want the role and didn't get it, feel free to add it to yourself or ask a master memer to do it for you. Have fun everyone!"

Andrew,
Andrew,"Goodbye, free time"
Andrew,I may be getting it as well in a few weeks
Andrew,you should at least try a different fire emblem game a little bit first
Andrew,"just to see if the gameplay is at all up your alley, cause three houses is pretty pricy"
Andrew,I just dropped ninety canadian pesos
Andrew,(tax included)
Andrew,"aight boys and possibly girls who have three houses, how's the difficulty in this game? ie should I play on normal or hard"
Andrew,Hard pussy
Andrew,
Andrew,(I don't own the game)
Andrew,naw I ended up doing normal+classic
Andrew,Bro
Andrew,You didn't even wait for a response
Andrew,I waited like five minutes
Andrew,you waited 3
Andrew,shhh
Andrew,maybe less
Andrew,It was 2 minutes since my message
Andrew,I'm impatient okay
Andrew,jeez
Andrew,Normal is too easy
Andrew,From everyone iv talked to
Andrew,welp too late now
Andrew,Just restart
Andrew,although I'm still on the prologue
Andrew,so yeah
Andrew,anyways if you think hard is too hard you can downgrade later
Andrew,but you can never upgrade
Andrew,"also side note, if I'm restarting I want to know the name of that weird chick who asks what my name is"
Andrew,"so that I can give myself the same name and see if she still goes ""all y'all humans got some wack ass names"""
Andrew,Sothis
Andrew,I highly doubt you'll get away with it but you can try
Andrew,also it'll definitely make dialogue weird eventually
Andrew,I feel like its just gonna be like
Andrew,"""No"""
Andrew,but w/e I'll figure stuff out with pronouns cause I'm gonna be a dude
Andrew,"pfft she still goes ""I shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names"""
Andrew,come on nintendo
Andrew,Wait are you actually allowed to do that
Andrew,What is she if not a human?
Andrew,wacl
Andrew,wack*
Andrew,based on her appearance and a few little details I've picked up Imma assume she's a dragon
Andrew,also I'm 90% sure she automatically has the same birthday as you
Andrew,cause she definitely comments on that one
Andrew,"also, don't tell me, but if she's eventually a playable character and romance option I'm gonna crack up"
Andrew,just for the theoretical
Andrew,"""Do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded wife?""
""I do.""
""And do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded husband?""
""I do."""
Andrew,aight they don't even change sothis' lines if your name is also sothis
Andrew,"maaaaan it made my weird friendship counter thing with Sothis decrease because I took the ""guess I'll die"" dialogue option"
Andrew,this has now made me afraid of choosing all the snarky options
Andrew,gg everyone gone
Andrew,i keep falling asleep in ma chair

Andrew, @Mr. Airplane
Andrew,2 bird 1 stone
Andrew,bruh wrench'd won shine
Andrew,good shit
Andrew,"leffen vs moky's about to be on, this should be good"
Andrew,or leffen's gonna slaughter him
Andrew,jesus moky is fast
Andrew,he's nuts
Andrew,side note who the hell is Kevin Maples
Andrew,and why is he in top 8
Andrew,everything moky does is a clip
Andrew,that game was so spaghetti
Andrew,"mostly leffen, but a little moky too"
Andrew,game five tho
Andrew,MOOOOKY
Andrew,YOU'RE NUUUUTS
Andrew,    
Andrew,LETS GO
Andrew,he SD'd super low and still went nuts
Andrew,that second last stock was unreal
Andrew,THE MENTAL
Andrew,leffen's already tweeted lol
Andrew,that was so fast
Andrew,all around that might have been the best fox ditto I've seen since armada retired
Andrew,can leffen ever complement his opponent
Andrew,that'd be nice
Andrew,https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439331114397698
Andrew,Played like shit but still better than I expected with no warmup. Very unlikely I'm playing losers tomorrow. Ggs all
Andrew,what a child
Andrew,he's been super salty all day
Andrew,
Andrew,Bruh
Andrew,"also, it's gonna be hbox vs ibdw, and moky vs winner of sfat s2j"
Andrew,I win my first top 16 match
Andrew,moky could make grands winner's side if ibdw wins
Andrew,i think ibdw would win a fox ditto
Andrew,if sfat beats s2j i could see ibdw winning the whole thing
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,"I wasn't saying moky would be favoured to make winner's side grands, just that it's not improbable"
Andrew,like 1/3 maybe
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439884292743168
Andrew,"Don't get me wrong, mokys sick and has been putting in work, he def deserves winners top 8 way more. Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"
Andrew,
Andrew,i mean gave him credit after giving like 8 johns and threatening to dq himself
Andrew,he's been threatening to DQ himself all day lol
Andrew,like several days actually
Andrew,"""Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"" and its an underhanded complement"
Andrew,I mean they both SD'd a bunch
Andrew,and I don't think that's so bad honestly
Andrew,like it's a bit john-y but w/e
Andrew,and I think it's fair given his SDs game 4
Andrew,I'd be hella salty
Andrew,I personally have no issue with the way leffen talks. It seems he uses a variant of the Max mindset.
Andrew,eh he's been really salty in general at shine
Andrew,"like zero respect for anyone who beats him, puts all the blame on stuff that... he controls, at least to a degree"
Andrew,every ult bracket he blames matchups he doesn't know
Andrew,and like yeah he's trying to learn stuff but at a certain point you just gotta suck it up
Andrew,"You've just described the Max mindset. In short ""Its always my own fault""."
Andrew,That is a great mindset for a winner
Andrew,yeah but I'm saying he's not doing that
Andrew,"he's blaming it on other stuff, like lack of sleep, or bad scheduling, or not knowing the matchups"
Andrew,Blaming SD's or playing bad or lack of matchup knowledge are all things that you did wrong
Andrew,he's putting the responsability on everything but himself and his opponent
Andrew,bad scheduling is the only thing you listed that is not his own fault
Andrew,okay but the sleep thing is a huge john
Andrew,Have you tried flying 6 timezones or so away and then having to play 13 hours in one day with no sleep
Andrew,yes but he chose that
Andrew,Seems hard and like a legitimate excuse
Andrew,it's like blaming that you're playing a low tier
Andrew,"like yeah, it's a disadvantage"
Andrew,but you chose the disadvantage
Andrew,he didn't have to play both games
Andrew,You can choose to switch mains. You don't choose to be born European.
Andrew,fly in earlier
Andrew,only play one game
Andrew,he was considering it
Andrew,"and he doesn't get to both decide he's in the position to play both games despite everything else, then when he loses blame those things"
Andrew,Its better than people dropping our constantly to preserve a reputation. Imagine a world like that.
Andrew,I'm glad he entered both games
Andrew,but that's not what I'm arguing about
Andrew,"I don't think the move to preserve his reputation would have been to only enter one, it would have been to not bitch about things that were at least partially under his control when things don't go his way"
Andrew,By reputation I mean ranking and future seeding
Andrew,but that's not what we're talking about
Andrew,we're talking about his behaviour and mentality
Andrew,I'm saying I would rather people stay in bracket and john when they lose instead of drop out whenever they think they are not playing their absolute best to preserve their ranking.
Andrew,"I'm normally on his side for a lot of things, but I think that the sequence of events of:

1) call out flaws with tournament
2) suggest how he could handle them better
3) not follow his own suggestions
4) bitch about the things he didn't avoid

is not a good look"
Andrew,"once you've reached 3), you're not really in a position to complain about it"
Andrew,I really don't even understand how his actions could be interpreted as points 2 and 3 but whatever.
Andrew,"he goes ""I should drop out of melee so that my sleep schedule and all that is intact cause I'm not really feeling it, plus fuck shine for making such a dumb schedule so their tourney should suffer for it."" That's #2. Playing anyway at the cost of his sleep and proper warmup for either game is #3. Blaming the tournament structure and his lack of sleep and warmup for his losses is #4"
Andrew,"my point isn't that he shouldn't have entered both games, it's that once he's committed to that, knowing full well all the issues it would cause him, I don't think he's entitled to complain about it"
Andrew,"again, it's like choosing a low tier. Yes, playing a low tier disadvantaged you, but you knew what you were getting yourself into, so suck it up or change characters. Don't blame the game for not making your character good"
Andrew,Welcome to 2019 everybody. A world in which a minecraft parody song by Captain Sparklez is the top trending song of the month. Lol how did this happen.

Andrew,
Andrew,I don't see him being any better than bottom 10 characters

Andrew,It's wack cause everyone on Reddit is like wow his recovery is so good

Andrew,Forever
Andrew,Evil
Andrew,I had the weirdest discussion with my housemates today
Andrew,we spent like 45 minutes discussing one question
Andrew,"""Can a person be taller than they are old?"""
Andrew,any baby
Andrew,done
Andrew,it spiralled off into like four hours of weird random stuff and it was a great time
Andrew,"Chris, explain"
Andrew,because the deeper you get into the specifics the more insane this conversation can become
Andrew,babies are 0 years of age
Andrew,babies are taller than 0 of any measurement for length
Andrew,Therefore yes
Andrew,A person can be taller than their age
Andrew,yeah that was me and one other guy's argument
Andrew,"but it got into a convoluted discussion of the meaning of age, weird semantics, and we eventually ended up talking about quantum physics"
Andrew,Interesting
Andrew,...
Andrew,...
Andrew,"basically one guy's point was that age cannot be zero, since its the amount of time that has passed since something came into existence, and if no time has passed, its age just flat out doesn't exist rather than being zero"
Andrew,"Well okay, even if you are one year old, you are probably taller than one of any significant form of measurement"
Andrew,Or once it does begin to exist after itnhas been born
Andrew,yeah but no kind of measurement was specified
Andrew,It's age will be somewhere between 0 and 1
Andrew,Therefore my original statement holds true aswell
Andrew,"also the fact that time and distance aren't really comparable, regardless of unit"
Andrew,which is how we ended up in quantum physics
Andrew,I mean I guess but in the context we can assume we are just comparing absolute values
Andrew,can we though
Andrew,do you even know the context
Andrew,the context was wack as hell
Andrew,
Andrew,it came from a badly translated article about yao ming's daughter
Andrew,how we got to that is another story
Andrew,but also it's late and I should sleep
Andrew,so gnight all
Andrew,Goodnight
Andrew,I was typing periods to test my lag since I wasn't able to send messages
Andrew,Those periods took several minutes to actually register as sent
Andrew,alright played a banjo online

Andrew,imagine needing fingers
Andrew,smh
Andrew,"i still got 17th because i won in winners, but i coulda done much better"
Andrew,"had my first kingston weekly since april 2018 yesterday:
ultimate (https://kingstonsmash.challonge.com/KU33): 38 people, I got 9th, but only because I lost to 4th seed (who won the whole thing), and then immediately got the top seed cause he sandbagged with banjo in winner's. Looking at who I would have had to fight if I he hadn't sandbagged, I would have had three people I've never lost to, so I probably should have gotten 4th. Also Lucas is a super wack matchup that I've never played so I'm glad I beat both the ones I fought.
melee (https://challonge.com/raw0xlb4): smaller tournament because there's a bigger event today, got 4/17, lost to 1st and 2nd, and all close games (0-2 for both, but still mostly last-hit games). Also, my marth is not ready for sheik. Beat a pr'd sheik where he jv3'd my marth and then I double two-stocked him with samus. Got 2 PR wins so I think I'm well on my way to this season's PR.
various traditional fighters that didn't have brackets: I'm nutty at unist even on a controller I'm not used to. Guilty gear is really fun but also really fucking hard, and I'm gonna be really upset if I end up with yet another fighting game where I hate the visual design of my best character."
Andrew,"now today I've got a bigger melee tournament that should have more of the PR (yesterday only had half the PR), and more people in general, and a proper unist bracket that I think I'll be able to place in the money for, so long as I can stay somewhat consistent with a weird control scheme"
Andrew,When my life is crumbling apart but it’s my birthday so I gotta play it cool 
Andrew,
Andrew,@Ultimate Someone fight me
Andrew,I can't seem to join voice in here so I'll be in frostbite 1
Andrew,tfw you dont have frostbyte 1
Andrew,@Galf
Andrew,Going to a tournament wish me luck. Also what character should I play @Ultimate ?
Andrew,Banjo Kazooie @Max
Andrew,No
Andrew,Pokemon trainer
Andrew,Then why ask
Andrew,
Andrew,Welp I did terribly in melee
Andrew,"Between pools and bracket, 1-4"
Andrew,Mostly respectable losses but I feel like I should have won 3 of them
Andrew,"On the flip side, second in unist"
Andrew,Got the reset bracket into get 3-0d classic
Andrew,well zack
Andrew,looks like its time to come back and play me in ultimate instead
Andrew,i lost to two pts so gotta grind 
Andrew,I'm 1-1 right now. Likely fighting a Samus next
Andrew,ya boi made five entire dollars from UNIST today
Andrew,and only spent 14 on the tournament and food
Andrew,and honestly I'm more happy that I didn't get 3rd than that I got 2nd
Andrew,because getting 3rd would have involved losing to someone who started playing unist last night
Andrew,he brought me to game 5 last round
Andrew,Basically double 3 stocked the Samus. My Palu is looking clean.
Andrew,Next match is the winner of an inkling ditto. Anyone got any tips for this matchup?
Andrew,@Max just play bowser 4head
Andrew,@Sak von Sak wanna jame jamer?
Andrew,Beat the inkling but lost to the same wolf player I lost to round 1 rip.
Andrew,Went 3-2
Andrew,Got 7th
Andrew,Got seeded terrible since no one knew who I was so I'm satisfied with my performance. Aside from 1 game of ike I went all Palu.
Andrew,i think
Andrew,bowser is actually bad vs heavies
Andrew,10/10 would recommend abandoned 1800s Masonic cemeteries
Andrew,Bro
Andrew,Bro
Andrew,We deadass were leaving and heard laughing around us
Andrew,We looked it up later and it's common for people to be chased out and get scratches from a witch who was hung and buried there
Andrew,And we all thought we were good but we got home and one of my friend checked his back and he had a long scratch mark down his back
Andrew,That cemetery is the #1 most haunted place in oregon
Andrew,Are you sure he didn't just get scratched on a tree branch or something?
Andrew,It was 3 scratches going sideways across his lower back
Andrew,It didn't look like a scratch from a bush
Andrew,And one of our other friends refused to go because he had gotten a deep scratch the last time he went
Andrew,MonkaW
Andrew,We were chilling and my stomach just dropped and I told them we had to get out of there before 12
Andrew,I had a feeling bad shit would happen if we were in there when it hit 12
Andrew,It was wack
Andrew,Just checked yesterdays bracket and I actually got 5th not 7th
Andrew,nice
Andrew,Guy who double eliminated me got 2nd

Andrew,This game is really fun
Andrew,I like the rabbit character
Andrew,Well come play
Andrew,
Andrew,I'm home in 1.5 hours
Andrew,The game is not fun but the art on that particular character's cards is rather amusing
Andrew,@Max
Andrew,I'll play poker
Andrew,Poker?
Andrew,Ayy
Andrew,Let's go
Andrew,Max I read a short book on poker
Andrew,What @Trapezoider ?
Andrew,So I don't suck now
Andrew,I mean I still suck just not as bad
Andrew,I've done a fair bit of reading on poker so I like to think I'm pretty decent when I'm full tryharding
Andrew,But doing that means folding like 70%+ of hands so I rarely do
Andrew,It just becomes boring for everyone
Andrew,Pls play
Andrew,You're just folding most of the time anyways
Andrew,What the heck
Andrew,truth
Andrew,Chris I'll play as soon as I'm home
Andrew,Your game then poker
Andrew,I mean is that not pro poker anyways
Andrew,foding 70% sounds about right
Andrew,"Like I said, that is the correct way to play if you want to win, it just is more fun to play a lot of hands."
Andrew,according to my dad i'm weird in that i play the same whether or not money is involved
Andrew,I would never play poker for real money
Andrew,i mean even for somehting liek 5 bucks
Andrew,I am opposed to gambling
Andrew,fair enough i suppose
Andrew,@Trapezoider we playin poker soon or wha t
Andrew,Did y’all end up actually playing poker
Andrew,Hello
Andrew,No we did not
Andrew,I thought I would be home sooner
Andrew,But repairing my window took longer than expected
Andrew,Smh
Andrew,@Zain Can you use your mode powers to get me a massive CSV of every message sent in chillin ?
Andrew,I'm not sure that is possible
Andrew,This is so sad
Andrew,I'm learning about language models
Andrew,and I wanted to train a net to generate text that is basically the average of frostbite
Andrew,
Andrew,Just go highlight everything
Andrew,
Andrew,I would also like to see some data science with the chat
Andrew,you could probably make a bot that would just scrape the entirety of a channel
Andrew,Like who has sent the most messages etc.
Andrew,"I'm not positive cause I""ve never worked with discord's api 'n stuff, but it should be doable"
Andrew,Its totally possible i recalla  friend of mine doing something similar
Andrew,not for frostbite obvs but
Andrew,Can you reach out to him and find out how
Andrew,I could train something by the end of the day
Andrew,It would be like the olive garden commercials
Andrew,sounds neat
Andrew,@Trapezoider just ctrl+a

Andrew,
Andrew,oh god
Andrew,what have they done to discord light theme
Andrew,
Andrew,I don't use that shit
Andrew,they made it so ugly
Andrew,like soooo ugly
Andrew,Insinuating that it wasn't already ugly
Andrew,What did they change?
Andrew,they removed the darker parts and just made everything the lighter version so now there's no more contrast and logical grouping of things that go together and everything just sorta blends together and looks awful
Andrew,and I don't know why they thought it was an improvement
Andrew,my best guess is they've just decided to drive the last holdouts over to dark theme and then delete light mode
Andrew,OH ITS AWFUL

Andrew,"Millennials, also known as Generation Y (or simply Gen Y), are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted definition. Millennials are sometimes referred to as ""echo boomers"" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The characteristics of millennials vary by region and by individual, and the group experiences a variety of social and economic conditions, but they are generally marked by their coming of age in the Information Age, and are comfortable in their usage of digital technologies and social media."

Andrew,He's cool but he's no beghoul
Andrew,
Andrew,"bored between classes so I made a tier list, come give me shit for my shit opinions"
Andrew,why does it only go to C tier
Andrew,because the game's well enough balanced that it doesn't need to go further down
Andrew,"I've seen games that don't go below B tier (shoutouts to UNIST, although technically it has Enkidu tier, containing just Enkidu, because he is terrible. Still got 5th at evo though.)"
Andrew,I'll have my tier list out in a few days
Andrew,So I will refrain from commenting for now
Andrew,cloud needs to be lower
Andrew,he's in b- tier
Andrew,there's a reason why the 2 best cloud players are dropping cloud and why i'm taking a break from smash
Andrew,"eeeh I don't think he's that low, but I might have put him a bit high. He's still got good tools and I feel like he mops up a solid chunk of the characters below him"
Andrew,but there's just characters who are more or less better cloud
Andrew,what tools? when all his moves have 0 priority and trade with almost anything
Andrew,"they aren't that bad, and they're pretty safe, if not plus. Also he has solid juggling and deals hella damage, and always has a comeback/blowup factor because his callout tools (fsmash, anything with limit) are really strong"
Andrew,UPAIR LOSES AND TRADES WITH BOWSER NAIR
Andrew,FUCKING BOWSER NAIR
Andrew,you can't tell me cloud has good shit
Andrew,when i've played him the most
Andrew,bowser nair is amazing what are you talking about
Andrew,everything loses to bowser nair
Andrew,barring insane disjoints
Andrew,hense my point. cloud sucks
Andrew,"which cloud doesn't have anymore, he only has moderate disjooints"
Andrew,losing to something that almost everyone else also loses to does not make your character bad
Andrew,^
Andrew,Benson your point there made no sense
Andrew,my point is that cloud's juggling game isnt great
Andrew,he struggles to kill
Andrew,and his disjoints suck
Andrew,his moves have no priority
Andrew,and his recovery is bad
Andrew,I'd like to point out that everything you just mentioned except the recovery thing applies to the entire chunk immediately above him
Andrew,"duck hunt,  the links, g&w, shulk"
Andrew,shulk at least has decent disjoints but also his juggling sucks
Andrew,and the poor boy can't kill without putting himself hugely at risk
Andrew,he has smash art
Andrew,at least that helps
Andrew,"which puts him hugely at risk as well, it's terrible for closing out games or making comebacks"
Andrew,also a great way to lose leads
Andrew,"but yes, he's a better character than cloud, which is why he's near the top of the tier as opposed to the bottom"
Andrew,cloud has a hard time dealing with people who constantly run away + sometimes can't kill until he lands a unstale move or throw at 220%
Andrew,on top of that his grab sucks balls
Andrew,yeah he's got issues
Andrew,but so does everyone at this point in the list
Andrew,"and he's able to safely poke with kill moves, which is a big deal"
Andrew,unless it's perfectly spaced in which it only hits the shield and not aimed at the opponent then yes
Andrew,but other than that
Andrew,no
Andrew,his bair is safe only if you spot dodge
Andrew,and his fair loses to fast oos options
Andrew,also parrying is a thing
Andrew,which makes bair unsafe
Andrew,which is his safest move
Andrew,yeah but parrying makes... basically everything unsafe
Andrew,so it's not a super valid issue
Andrew,@Max @Sak von Sak @TheRainbowpixelz @The Rona anyone down for some smash
Andrew,wanna play some ike
Andrew,"got another lecture in 20 minutes, I'd be down after that tho"
Andrew,just got back from class
Andrew,so in like an hour and a half or so
Andrew,i have class later 
Andrew,at 5
Andrew,also kameron come shit on my tier list
Andrew,I'll play
Andrew,your tier list trash
Andrew,or join the argument about how I placed cloud
Andrew,cloud sucks and is bottom of mid tier
Andrew,"you put mega man, zss, chrom, ness, gren, pac, shulk way too low"
Andrew,"I don't think zss deserves to be any higher imo, and the rest might be a bit better but I feel like results on them are all dropping off (except shulk)"
Andrew,imagine thinking mega man and pac results are dropping off
Andrew,I may have just not seen any
Andrew,kameme won an s tier 
Andrew,oh
Andrew,solo mm?
Andrew,p much
Andrew,mostly megaman
Andrew,hm might move him to like around pac then
Andrew,bowser being above pac and mega man is a joke
Andrew,megaman is better than bowser
Andrew,not sure about pac
Andrew,well :/ it depends  on the mu
Andrew,they are not characters I know a ton about
Andrew,it wasn't exactly an extensively researched tier list
Andrew,most of megaman and pac is theory crafting
Andrew,judging the megaman placing by japanese players at evo megaman and duck hunt have gone up in my tier lsit
Andrew,but there's still not enough information via games to justify if they are actually good or not
Andrew,"we'll see, my assumption is that like most not-super-popular characters that are being labbed out, there'll be a bunch of new tech found, their results will shoot up, then people will start figuring out the matchup and the results will drop a bit, but still be noticeably higher than initially"
Andrew,"so it's hard to say at what point any characters like that are, especially if you're me and haven't even noticed the good results"
Andrew,you've seen that duck hunt and how much safe pressure it can put out
Andrew,with pac-man ive already seen people learn how to play around his neutral b galiga
Andrew,we just have to wait and see more to fully get a grasp on these zoners

Andrew,thoughts?
Andrew,Melee might be more fun with only battlefield tbh
Andrew,id be down to ban puff
Andrew,That would be even better
Andrew,Banning things to make the game more fun is perfectly fine in my opinion
Andrew,Like TF2 6s does
Andrew,tf2 6s wasnt really banning things
Andrew,it was building a competitive game from the ground up
Andrew,If heavy had GRU and his slowing minigun legal he would have seen play
Andrew,it was a 'constructive ruleset'
Andrew,"When hungrybox is in attendance, Ultimate top 8 probably has a faster average game speed. How depressing that one character can slow down an entire game."
Andrew,Just ban Hungrybox
Andrew,when he is maybe gonna lose he plays lame
Andrew,
Andrew,puff encourages non-interaction
Andrew,Characters should not have multiple jumps
Andrew,Meta knight had the same issue of air camping

Andrew,"It depends on what the fitness challenge is. Maybe its ""Who can achieve the highest proportional increase in weight lifting"" or ""Who can keep the highest average heart rate over the month??"" IDK

Andrew,this is some wack gamer mouse design
Andrew,but it's apparently a crazy good mouse and only $50
Andrew,p sure its to reduce weight by using less material
Andrew,could be wrong tho
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,but it looks so gamer
Andrew,I bought it
Andrew,(current mouse is dying)
Andrew,which is weird cause my mouse i can put extra weights in to make ti heavier
Andrew,which i do
Andrew,I actually like lighter mice
Andrew,doesn't have the same heft but also it just feels super free and easy
Andrew,idk for me it feels like i can be more accurate with a heavier mouse
Andrew,prob cause im adjusted to it now tho
Andrew,also I do a lot of my mousing with my fingers and wrist rather than my arm
Andrew,so light is a lot easier
Andrew,I say as i just overshot a program on my taskbar and opened steam
Andrew,lol

Andrew,Okay the ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion is wack
Andrew,
Andrew,Are you talking about the TV series or the movie?
Andrew,Theres a movie?
Andrew,:0
Andrew,Im talking about the TV series
Andrew,"There is a movie ""End of Evangelion"""
Andrew,That fixes the ending
Andrew,FR???
Andrew,yes
Andrew,THANK GOD
Andrew,I was kind of dissatisfied 
Andrew,you should still watch the zero budget TV series end though because its funny
Andrew,Thanks for letting me know buddy
Andrew,It was really zero budget?
Andrew,no
Andrew,I thought this was supposed to be intentionally artsy
Andrew,but they did have some problems
Andrew,it was not meant to be like this
Andrew,Thats good to know
Andrew,yeah they flat out ran out of money
Andrew,oof
Andrew,which is hilarious to me since it ended up being one of the most profitable anime franchises ever
Andrew,just... not during production
Andrew,it's weird how iconic that show is
Andrew,like I bet if you played the theme song
Andrew,most people would recognize it and go
Andrew,hmmm I know this song but not where it is from
Andrew,"There is a video called something like ""Can you live entirely off Evangelion Merchandise?"". There is so much of it that you basically can."
Andrew,spoilers
Andrew,I'm reading online
Andrew,"and people are saying ""They ran out of money"" is a myth"
Andrew,can someone source this please?
Andrew,They had problems with the original ending being too similar to a terrorist attack and thought it would be in poor taste to release it is the long answer.
Andrew,"honestly it's not that weird that the show ended up being as iconic as it was, at least within anime. It kinda revolutionized an entire genre and brought a ton of new ideas and directions into the medium and is a huge part of why anime is the way it is, but despite that no one's quite managed to replicate what made it work. The weird thing is that it's so recognizable to people who don't know much of anything about anime"
Andrew,facts
Andrew,"I didn't know what the show was until gigukk made the ""Basically, Netflix's Evangelion"""
Andrew,But before seeing that I had inadvertently seen tons of references to the show around the internet
Andrew,It was a good watch
Andrew,Time for the film
Andrew,dayum I've got the ESL new york finals in the background and apparently EG just beat Astralis 16-3 on Astralis' pick?
Andrew,let's go NA
Andrew,"Honestly, I didn't even know EG had a CSGO team."
Andrew,they bought NRG's roster
Andrew,"like, a week ago"
Andrew,I only know about it because they keep mentioning it on commentary

Andrew,@Ultimate ?
Andrew,There's a common concept that to be really good at something you first have to suck at it and fail a bunch
Andrew,However usually people who end up really good at something start fairly good at the thing
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,So it's a dumb and ultimately harmful concept
Andrew,You are only getting half of that right
Andrew,"Your ability to master any skill is pretty much directly related to your IQ. 

Two dudes start learning a game for instance. Jim's IQ is 130 while Bob's is 100. 

If they both practice 8 hours a day, by the end of the month Jim is pretty much guaranteed to be way better than Bob. 

When they started they both sucked and failed to play the game well. What differentiates them is the Jim was able to learn and reduce his failures/attempts WAY faster than Bob."
Andrew,TLRD: To be good at something you do have to fail... BUT your number of failures will be vastly lower than someone with a lower IQ and you will master the skill quicker.
Andrew,Okay get the fuck out of here. You did not just start typing the MOMENT I open discord @Mr. Airplane
Andrew,
Andrew,MonkaW
Andrew,
Andrew,I am watching you
Andrew,I mean uh
Andrew,D:
Andrew,monkaS
Andrew,@Trapezoider so because I picked up melee quicker than you I have a higher iq right?
Andrew,jed actual 
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,Apparently reaction time is indicative of higher IQ as well
Andrew,I wouldn't be surprised if you have more brain points
Andrew,Oh wack
Andrew,

Andrew,How will he sruvive without his assistant
Andrew,The Baron is on vacation in Fiji
Andrew,Ah understandable

Andrew,try not to die
Andrew,I will
Andrew,Skydiving is idiotic in my opinion
Andrew,Why
Andrew,cause I was like hey what if I went skydiving
Andrew,It's probably safer than driving a car
Andrew,oh
Andrew,Not you
Andrew,lmao yeah I said that to my mom
Andrew,I mean is true
Andrew,Just cause something seems scary
Andrew,Doesn't mean it is scary
Andrew,I feel like you should do things you think are scary

Andrew,I've never had an open book test
Andrew,Is that normal?
Andrew,depends
Andrew,it's fairly common in courses like this one where there's a ton of formulas to memorize that aren't as important as actually knowing how to apply them

Andrew,yep hard work and a lotta time dedication can get you pretty far

Andrew,Yeah but I mean for really skilled artists like me our talents just develope naturally

Andrew,"So as many of you know I've started a new campaign and for this one i wanted to have an introduction so that there could something in between starting situation and when the players actually started to play. When i was going about writing this i said to myself it would really suck if i were to fuck this up when i have to read it so why not just record it and play it for the players over some music. I decided ultimately to not do that and it went perfectly fine but while i did not put into practice my recording idea i did however record 30 clips of me trying to record this introduction and on all of the 29 clips i failed. I ended up getting pretty mad the last one in this video was perfect, but all the rest are just me raging so i asked some people if they wanted to see it and they said they did so here for your enjoyment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YFx7qlhq0&feature=youtu.be"

Andrew,month at the most

Andrew,like do they give you books to read or something
Andrew,nope
Andrew,at least for the most part
Andrew,so do you just sit there
Andrew,yes sir
Andrew,i wouldnt do it for more than like a week then
Andrew,i think i would start going insane after that

Andrew,yeet
Andrew,sheik is so bad in melee
Andrew,actually awful recovery
Andrew,m2k beat hbox
Andrew,hype
Andrew,Plup beat Salem lololol
Andrew,he took game 1 vs tweek
Andrew,ohhh
Andrew,Is it on stream?
Andrew,no
Andrew,he lost 3-1 lol
Andrew,plup and armada both placed 17th
Andrew,mew2king really is the coolest marth
Andrew,Did leo not got to big house
Andrew,no
Andrew,Melee saved
Andrew,Praise almighty Mang0
Andrew,Zain is so good what the heck
Andrew,that girl sceaming in the background fucked over leffen
Andrew,i would be hella tilted
Andrew,That's the mang0
Andrew,Long live melee
Andrew,
Andrew,Yes
Andrew,ay I broke my 9th place ultimate curse
Andrew,by getting 13th
Andrew,still counts
Andrew,I was about to type a congratulatory message...
Andrew,(also in all fairness this was a monthly with a bunch of out-of-town people)
Andrew,(so there were like twenty more people than usual)
Andrew,King's Court?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,Big House melee was great to watch because Hbox got eliminated early
Andrew,"I did maintain my UNIST 2nd place curse though, so I got $5"
Andrew,which failed to cover the $17 I spent on entering four tournaments
Andrew,also yeah I'm sad I missed top 8
Andrew,from looking at the bracket it looks nuts
Andrew,What other two did you enter?
Andrew,"melee singles, ult singles, ult dubs, unist"
Andrew,"also tekken, which was free"
Andrew,game is wack
Andrew,"""So I jump into the air, you see? and then I fly down at you?""
""Yeah.""
""It's an overhead. But technically it's unblockable. But it can be blocked low."""
Andrew,???
Andrew,ayo what
Andrew,zackray's playing corrin
Andrew,he lost
Andrew,yeah he got pretty booped
Andrew,but not much more on corrin than on joker
Andrew,nairo's playing DK what is this tournament
Andrew,Zackray in summit
Andrew,Game and Watch looks super annoying to play against
Andrew,Up B and his smash attacks are so spammable
Andrew,And up air
Andrew,alright boys
Andrew,Im hype
Andrew,I just spent an hour
Andrew,Trying to find a copy of this textbook that is $300

Andrew,optimaaaaal
Andrew,
Andrew,Uhh
Andrew,My game is fucked
Andrew,Guys is it just me or are kamerons drawings getting better? 
Andrew,how dare you. Kameron's art is already at peak perfection. It cannot ascend any higher.
Andrew,Honestly
Andrew,every time kameron draws the bar for perfection simply moves up

Andrew,Dolphin Emulator 2019.10.08 - 00.34.37.03.DVR Trim
Andrew,oh hey indivisible came out today
Andrew,must... finish.... assignment... first
Andrew,"bleh I'm strongly considering just not handing in this assignment. It's only worth ~6% of my mark, and as far as I've been able to tell I'm following the instructions to a T and it's not working (so I assume I'm misunderstanding something, but I have no idea what). Went for office hours and the TA just never showed up. I could go in for a different TA's office hours tomorrow (it's due tonight so I'd be taking late marks but I'd still get most of the grades), but with all the other stuff I have on my plate I honestly think it might not be worth it."
Andrew,That sucks dude
Andrew,this course is such a nightmare
Andrew,What class is this?
Andrew,neural nets
Andrew,the content is really interesting
Andrew,but the prof sucks
Andrew,and 2/3 TAs suck
Andrew,"and the lecture slides suck, and the assignments are missing like half the information you'd need to do the assignment, and there's zero feedback on anything"
Andrew,every time this year you've seen me complain about a course it's been this one
Andrew,Is there a department head that you could talk to about this?
Andrew,This honestly sounds really annoying
Andrew,"probably, but they're notoriously backed up one everything"
Andrew,@Ultimate yall wanna do some fun ultimate thing later
Andrew,like a character crew battle?
Andrew,I'd be down if I can get all my stuff done
Andrew,that's why im working rn

Andrew,Do you understand implicit differentiation?
Andrew,"I don't remember what implicit differentiation is, but I know how I'd solve this normally"
Andrew,Mostly
Andrew,so I dunno how much help I'll be
Andrew,I can help
Andrew,I know what the rules are but sometimes Isolating y' is very hard

Andrew,Uhhhhh
Andrew,Please tell me whippets are something else in canada
Andrew,Isn't that a drug?
Andrew,lol no
Andrew,It's nitrous oxide in canisters and you huff it
Andrew,But I assume it's something else
Andrew,Unless Canada has some lit grocery stores
Andrew,
Andrew,Ah
Andrew,I see
Andrew,they are very addicting though
Andrew,but usually more expensive than I would pay for
Andrew,but it was 2 boxes for $5 as opposed to one box for $3.50
Andrew,oh i thought whippets were dogs
Andrew,they are that as well
Andrew,two boxes of dogs for $5 would be pretty amazing
Andrew,although that'd be a lot of dogs to take care of
Andrew,but I could probably sell them at a reasonable markup
Andrew,i wonder how many dogs comes in one box
Andrew,@Ultimate anyone downs?
Andrew,thats a little personal of a question dont ya think

Andrew,you fought the spirit of my frustration at this neural nets assignment
Andrew,yoshi link might be 100 0
Andrew,that matchup feels very impossible
Andrew,@Trapezoider @The Rona Rocket launched

Andrew,Kingston Smash Ultimate 2019 - Weekly #39 - Challonge
Andrew,"(also got 7th in melee, was one stock away from beating #3 in the city too but then I choked, and continued my unbroken string of 2nd places in unist, although I took a game off the best player in the city this time)"
Andrew,Nice losers run
Andrew,thanks :)
Andrew,I played such a weird mix of characters
Andrew,but like 2/3 incineroar and it worked really well
Andrew,I made one guy soooo mad and ended up getting my first PR win for the season
Andrew,"he won game 1, I took game 2, then he swapped off his main (dedede) for roy which was hilarious cause of all those incineroar-roy games I played against max where I learned to cheese the poor boy (runoff lariat), then he pulled a PT and I showed him why you don't try to zone out incineroar"
Andrew,I feel bad for him. Incineroar would be in gouge eyes out tier of my annoying tier list.
Andrew,yeah a little bit
Andrew,I played some Bowser today
Andrew,oh no
Andrew,man is easy
Andrew,are we gonna have three
Andrew,no
Andrew,yeah he's pretty straight forward
Andrew,I just wanted to prove a point
Andrew,have I ever pretended like he's not easy?
Andrew,That wasn't the point. I was proving that he is good.
Andrew,I always thought he was pretty good too?
Andrew,he's at worst upper mid tier
Andrew,These points were not directed at you
Andrew,fair
Andrew,I learned some new ledge trapping tricks with Palu as well in my session today against Benson.
Andrew,I also finally hit this one unist combo in a real match for once
Andrew,the one and only time I get to feel like mika actually has good damage
Andrew,"costs half my meter as a starter though, and the other half as the ender, but it does like 50% of most characters health"
Andrew,"was also the first time I didn't feel totally outmatched against harley (he did still 3-1 3-0 me between winner's and grand finals, but most of the games were really close)"
Andrew,Have you lost to him for every 2nd place finish?
Andrew,"naw, the weeks he wasn't there I lost to different people -_-"
Andrew,but he is responsible for most of them
Andrew,ay I just found that discord has a setting that puts light theme pretty much back to how it used to be
Andrew,it's not quite as good but now I have a better alternative to dark mode so I'm going for it
Andrew,dark sidebar pog
Andrew,yup
Andrew,although the old light theme had a lighter grey for the sidebar
Andrew,it also had a darker bit for the users sidebar
Andrew,but it's still better than all dark
Andrew,but new light theme kinda nice tho

Andrew,Easy one that people will like is a call for more environmentally friendly behavior.
Andrew,"You can talk about the importance of participating in a democracy. Cite low voter turnout percentages, and encourage voting in the next election."
Andrew,yeah but im pretty sure that the person right before me is doing that already
Andrew,the environment one
Andrew,oh snap voting could be good
Andrew,except that i dont do it
Andrew,Do they know that though

Andrew,i am watching stuff
Andrew,"weekly summary:
7th in melee, lost to 1st and 2nd place, had pretty close sets against both of em (last stock game 3 with 2nd, two last hit games with 1st)

5th in ultimate, lost to 1st and 4th. Got bodied by the guy who won, game 5 last hit with the 4th place guy (who I kinda sorta hate as a human being and he said he'd quit if he ever lost to incineroar, so I'm real sad about that)

2nd in unist as always, but probably featured the ""highlight"" of the weekly, where between the last game of winner's finals and first two games of grands, I landed one hit. In those three games (six rounds) I was perfected 5 times. I have never been so completely destroyed in any game ever. Not playing melee against Ryan Ford or Moky, or ringing for plat 6s when I was in steel. Holy fuck I got completely and utterly shredded."
Andrew,I also ate an excellent burrito that was far beyond my capacity for spiciness but it was so damn good that I kept taking these huge bites and then dying for the next five minutes then being really excited to take another bite

Andrew,                                                                                                                              
Andrew,
Andrew,Man imagine playing  cowboi game when you arent even american
Andrew,smfh
Andrew,Game fun as fuck though
Andrew,imagine buying rdr2 twice
Andrew,literally spending 120 dollars on a video game
Andrew,Literally didn't buy it the first time
Andrew,My dad bought it for himself
Andrew,I just mooched
Andrew,Kameron out here thinking we pay 120 dollars for 2 video games
Andrew,
Andrew,TRUE
Andrew,not in canadian schmeckles my friend
Andrew,my b i meant 400 chuck e cheese coupons
Andrew,^
Andrew,there you go
Andrew,@Trapezoider where'd you find my dpotg vods?
Andrew,@Cs:go any1?
Andrew,Youtub
Andrew,Can yousend me the link I couldn't find it
Andrew,@Cs:go
Andrew,need a fifth
Andrew,Someone just sent me a pic on Snapchat of them holding a pumpkin spiced latte and saying “still holding onto those fall vibes”
Andrew,Like ofc you are it’s still fall you dumb bitch
Andrew,"I think theyre saying that the ""fall vibes"" have become tangible through the latte that theyve had for a while"
Andrew,kinda deep if you think about it
Andrew,Ok push guy
Andrew,Ok now I go this way
Andrew,People in r/smashbros don't understand how balance work
Andrew,Actually neither do blizzard tbh
Andrew,Whenever you talk about the general public
Andrew,They generally have no idea how to balance a game
Andrew,you aren't supposed to buff bad character's weakness or nerf good character's strengths
Andrew,you buff bad character's inherent strengths and nerf good characters inherent weaknesses
Andrew,that keeps characters different and interesting
Andrew,like people on r/smashbros are saying to buff incineroar's speed
Andrew,but that would not make any sense with how incineroar works as a character
Andrew,he's slow because his moves are really good and cover a lot of space
Andrew,same as people who wanted to nerf roadhog's hook but make him more tanky
Andrew,the tradeoff for roadhog was that he can have a high burst damage output but you risk dieing and feeding ult charge
Andrew,oh god fast incineroar would be horrifying
Andrew,but hurr durr he a tank he shouldnt do damage but he should have damage resistances like every other tank that already exists but have more utility than hog when you remove his hook's usefullness
Andrew,also yea fast incineroar would be stupid
Andrew,just let PT play as any three pokemon
Andrew,he'd just be better bowser
Andrew,why would you want that r/smashbros
Andrew,not pt incin
Andrew,becasue r/smashbros is not a particularly smart environment
Andrew,but like these are core concepts of game balance
Andrew,also that was a suggestion for a different dumb change
Andrew,it would be funny
Andrew,like preschooler level stuff
Andrew,but also wack as fuck
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,you only nerf a strong character's strengths if you didn't actually mean to make it a strength/overdid it
Andrew,you dont remove characters weaknesses when they bad or every char is gonna feel the same
Andrew,^
Andrew,true
Andrew,like it's good that sm4sh took out diddy down throw up air up air up air
Andrew,and made bayo stuff less consistent (for all the good that did)
Andrew,like the only change I would make to pika is make him bigger or make his moves do less damage
Andrew,but in general if you take away both strengths and weaknesses you end up with a bland cast
Andrew,because fast safe moves and an insane recover are supposed to be pika's strengths
Andrew,imo I'd make him upb on stage more punishable
Andrew,but being small and doing a lot of damage are not
Andrew,it's kind of a dumb neutral tool
Andrew,yea mayb
Andrew,but that would fall into your thing of a strength being too strong
Andrew,like joker for example is a fundementally broken char
Andrew,"but yeah his whole point is that he's small, fast, and has high-execution stuff that's really good"
Andrew,because his strengths and weaknesses do not adhere to the design of the game
Andrew,yeah he's a weird one
Andrew,I can't really think of a good way to fix him without totally redesigning him as a character
Andrew,so he should be changed entirely imo
Andrew,also some parts of his kit are just crazy overtuned
Andrew,like down gun
Andrew,I mean really you just gotta change how arsene and down gun work
Andrew,and side b doing like 17
Andrew,and his arsene moves having hitboxes the size of bowser
Andrew,but yea arsene coming from taking damage makes no sense
Andrew,and hitting him with arsene should make it go away very quickly
Andrew,"I'd say just make it so that if he eats a certain number of attacks he just loses arsense automatically, so if you hit him with like four moves (not four hits, four moves) he's back to normal"
Andrew,or just like
Andrew,yea
Andrew,make him more in line with the game he's from
Andrew,and just have arsene for his specials
Andrew,and his normals are his normals
Andrew,or maybe 25 damage and arsene goes away
Andrew,he'd still be really good but not as dumb
Andrew,but he gets arsene by dealing 30 damage
Andrew,or make it time based idk
Andrew,or go the p4a route of if you hit him with arsene out enough times he just has no arsene for the whole stock
Andrew,meh characters changing based on stock stuff like that is kinda dumb imo
Andrew,eh maybe
Andrew,like lucario
Andrew,or krool
Andrew,krool?
Andrew,his belly can break
Andrew,oh right
Andrew,or wonderwing
Andrew,but banjo is just lame tho
Andrew,also I gotta say I hate that arsene is such a bad mechanic because the visual design for arsene is so damn cool
Andrew,but in smash it's such an anti-fun mechanic
Andrew,and also you can barely see him
Andrew,it really be tho
Andrew,zack why dont you play joker
Andrew,cause he's not all that fun imo
Andrew,I don't like having to rely on arsene or tricky setups for my kills
Andrew,I really wanted to like him
Andrew,Only big losers play joker
Andrew,Wrong
Andrew,Only big winners play joker
Andrew,Also
Andrew,Only cuties
Andrew,
Andrew,whens kameron 5
Andrew,soon
Andrew,brother
Andrew,"Zack: 15
Kameron: 8"
Andrew,@SWIRL GIRL @Bitmin @Mr. Airplane csgo
Andrew,yes
Andrew,10 minutes
Andrew,then me and matt play
Andrew,@Cs:go need 1 more
Andrew,i can come in 10
Andrew,Paradise Lost might be up there as one of the works books I've ever been forced to read
Andrew,By Milton?
Andrew,No the other paradise lost
Andrew,They buffed incineroar's neutral b a bunch 
Andrew,Spin move time
Andrew,Spin move!
Andrew,patch notes?
Andrew,also WHY did they buff incineroar neutral b
Andrew,move's already mad good
Andrew,Also Terry is out already
Andrew,We play later tonight lads @Ultimate
Andrew,Time to pick up another character
Andrew,lol they buffed incineroar neutral b... third hit
Andrew,just specifically the third hit
Andrew,of like five
Andrew,They buffed the rest of the move too keep reading
Andrew,(oh wait that was jabs I'm dumb)
Andrew,that is a big yikes
Andrew,and revenge lasts longer and has less end lag
Andrew,fair got a bit nerfed though? hard to tell
Andrew,either they added a weak hitbox or they really extended the weak hitbox I can't tell
Andrew,Terry appearantly is kinda nice
Andrew,No Palu nerfs
Andrew,I'm satisfied
Andrew,I'm definitely a little upset they buffed Incineroar though
Andrew,I mean he doesn't have any new goofy stuff
Andrew,just some of his old goofy stuff is better
Andrew,I still don't think it's enough for me to solo main him
Andrew,"(also, probably won't immediately be joining ultimate stuff tonight, some of my housemates who play traditional fighters want to learn, and also I'm gonna be learning some soul caliber, so I probably won't be around until pretty late)"
Andrew,I have a test tomorrow so I will be trying Terry offline for like 5 minutes but won't be here to play online games.
Andrew,
Andrew,just study now and we can play later
Andrew,I have to go to class now
Andrew,I just woke up
Andrew,
Andrew,oh dear terry has double quarter circle inputs
Andrew,and also what appears to be ghetto qc back half circle forwards
Andrew,this is what we get for KoF characters
Andrew,Kinda hype for Terry not gonna lie
Andrew,@Ultimate fite me
Andrew,I'll play for 30 minutes

Andrew,ill play but gonna bathroom first
Andrew,"""Let's say you want to play poker. Let's say, hypothetically, you want to get a group of friends and play poker. Ok, and if you did play with friends, you would want to play with the homies right? Then hypothetically speaking, there would be a frostbite poker night. Now, let's say its tonight.

Now that we have established that there will be a poker night and the homies are invited, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that it would be fun. Am I not correct? A group of the homies deserves poker night, so I suggest that we play poker."""

Andrew,I had such a lucky bracket lol
Andrew,able dq'd?
Andrew,"able DQ'd, and while I've brought him to last hit both times I've fought him he's always won, then Lungs upset Boo who I probably would have lost to again"
Andrew,and then dog was playing luigi instead of his usual sheik
Andrew,and his usual sheik fucks me up
Andrew,made $10.50 from a $2 entry fee
Andrew,did not cover the cost of entering two brackets and buying a giant burrito

Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,"Got 33rd (3-2) at an ultimate regional, which I'm okay with given that both players I lost to finished 7th. I couldn't plausibly have done better given my seeding and I feel like I played pretty well. Also I made another campy player really mad about Incineroar which is always nice. Didn't even need revenge, just knowing that a) dash attack picks up banana and you're diddy so I don't care about the tiny punish you might get from that, b) while holding banana I still have access to sideb, lariat, and upb, and c) banana -> sideb is a thing Incineroar can do."

Andrew,Good one
Andrew,"“I don’t think I’ll have kids”
- Boring
- Invites argument

“My bloodline dies with me”
- Assertive
- Metal as fuck
- Implies you’re taking on a great noble burden which allows no arguments"
Andrew,ty devon very cool
Andrew,Me and Joan were discussing antinatalism and my 7 month pregnant boss walked in
Andrew,I’ll keep y’all posted if I still have a job next week
Andrew,Antinatalism is super toxic
Andrew,It's up there with the death acceptance movement as one of my least favorite philosophical positions.
Andrew,"Holdup why is the death acceptance movement one of your least favourite positions, I’m genuinely trying to find anything somebody could object to about it"
Andrew,I have no idea why anyone would want to die given the alternative.
Andrew,Suffering?
Andrew,Eternal life is the ultimate goal of all medical research. Death and aging cause so much suffering that to end it would be a triumph unparalleled for all time.
Andrew,Death acceptance is not a debate on medical suicide if that's what you were thinking
Andrew,It means opposing eternal life
Andrew,If that’s your stance then I don’t see how you can be antinatalism if you think living forever is the end goal then obv once we can live forever we need to stop having kids
Andrew,No
Andrew,We need to expand to other planets
Andrew,So I understand the death acceptance movement and given the opportunity to have eternal life I would decline
Andrew,There’s no point in living without dying imo
Andrew,That is so contrary to my own belief I cannot comprehend why anyone would ever think that.
Andrew,Eternal life is cool but if eternal life means an eternity of floating in the middle of space aimlessly while i lose my mind id rather not
Andrew,"Would you ask the grim reaper to bring you blindness, weakness, ugliness, and an end to your relatives and yourself if he were a real entity. Why not just ask for nothing and lead a more enjoyable existence."
Andrew,Eternal life doesn't mean you literally exist until the end of the universe
Andrew,@Rotomotorz
Andrew,"Watch CGP Grey's video ""why die"" for a great overview of my position"
Andrew,?
Andrew,Floating in the middle of space aimlessly
Andrew,i.e.
Andrew,just you floating in space
Andrew,no ground for you to stand on
Andrew,no like in a shuttle
Andrew,not literally just you
Andrew,The concept of one day you will die gives life more purpose and meaning IMO
Andrew,"Also  @Max , does your idea of eternal life also include eternal youth?"
Andrew,Yes of course. The research of the two go hand in hand.
Andrew,"Okay, that's what I thought"
Andrew,One will be a natural result of the other
Andrew,But I wanted to make sure
Andrew,"Also @Eric Working From Home , you will still eventually die"
Andrew,In your uptown world is capitalism abolished or are human wage slaves for eternity
Andrew,It's just about delaying that for as long as possible
Andrew,Would you beat your child to make the days you don't beat him more enjoyable?
Andrew,Utopian**
Andrew,@Max that is so far from the point it’s mind boggling
Andrew,Death giving life meaning is analogous to what I said
Andrew,wait yeah thats definitely not analogous
Andrew,I mean it bigly ain’t
Andrew,If you think so then you don't understand my position
Andrew,The concept of dying means your days are numbered and gives motivation to enjoy you days as you can
Andrew,If you could live forever you’d have no motivation to accomplish anything
Andrew,Maybe if you are lazy
Andrew,I think it would lead to even greater progress since humans would never have to reset their knowledge pool
Andrew,what gives people motivation during endless life
Andrew,tho
Andrew,Life is meaning in itself
Andrew,I guess if you don't share that position none of my others make any sense
Andrew,I have to go to class now
Andrew,Perhaps but what do you plan to do with the people who view otherwise
Andrew,Let them die obviously
Andrew,so then endless life is a choice?
Andrew,Why wouldn't it be
Andrew,or is it given to only select individuals
Andrew,And if its a choice what do you do with those of no ambition that choose to live forever
Andrew,Not many people instictively wabt to die
Andrew,People should have the option of death should they choose
Andrew,I can consent to dying I couldn’t consent to being born
Andrew,Like what if everybody all stopped having kids and humanity just lived in this utopian society until we all eventually died out and then the earth can try again in 1000000 years once primates evolve to our level
Andrew,That’s the dream right there baby
Andrew,Why would we not want ourselves to evolve?
Andrew,Why would we want to end as homo sapiens?
Andrew,When we could become homo superior?
Andrew,What you propose is literally the opposite of what life tries to do
Andrew,Life doesn’t take ethics and morality into account
Andrew,Life doesn’t care if it’s ethically and morally wrong to have a child
Andrew,I don't think it needs to
Andrew,It just wants you to procreate and die
Andrew,It supercedes all things
Andrew,ethics and morality are mere concepts that we as humans have come up with
Andrew,Life is a concept not an entity
Andrew,Aren’t ethics and morality what we view and making us different and superior to non sentient races
Andrew,Living != surviving
Andrew,Life doesn't need to be an entity to supercede other concepts
Andrew,If you are of the opinion that we should be slaves to the machinations of life then why oppose death
Andrew,One merely exists because of the other
Andrew,I also don't understand how procreation would be ethically or morally wrong
Andrew,"A child can’t consent to being born, a child is burdened by the implications of society without being given a choose and inversely society is burdened by another person to cause damage to others and the world"
Andrew,If you want a kid then adopt one
Andrew,"There’s only three reasons to birth a child: ignorance, narcissism or both."
Andrew,"That is a pretty narrow statement though, don't you think?"
Andrew,What about that is narrow
Andrew,Just because something cannot consent to being born doesn't mean that it is unhappy because it was
Andrew,Also
Andrew,It only takes into account the morality and ethics side of life
Andrew,"We don’t owe life, it will persist regardless of our actions so why should we slave to it"
Andrew,Why shouldn't I owe life? It allows me to exist and be who I am today. Passing on my own genes doesn't mean that I am a slave to life
Andrew,So you want to have children to pass on your genes
Andrew,It also gives others the chance to experience what life has to offer
Andrew,I realize that this could be interpreted as your both statement
Andrew,but so what?
Andrew,Why don’t we just agree to disagree then cause it seems we are at an impasse
Andrew,
Andrew,This is 100% topic
Andrew,But
Andrew,I just got my schedule for next term
Andrew,"and again, I only got 3 of the classes that I enrolled for"
Andrew,Bruh hunt down the guy making the schedules
Andrew,That’s bogus
Andrew,So I went to look at all the class schedules
Andrew,To see what was causing the conflict
Andrew,and
Andrew,There isn't any
Andrew,There is literally no conflict
Andrew,I didn't get put into these classes for reasons unknown
Andrew,These classes are still open by the way

Andrew,"also, at the tourney today we ran doubles, I ended up teaming in melee with a guy who's not all that good (generally goes 1-2 or 2-2, has no PR wins for the season) on the semi-arbitrary recommendation of dayman and we ended up going pretty hard - beat a team of #3 in the city and a guy around my level, and we were the only team to take a game off the team that won

we placed third, which doesn't seem all that impressive given that there were only 5 teams, but we crushed a team with players around the same levels, and beat a team we had absolutely no right to even get a game from"
Andrew,@Homies quick bitta games or naw
Andrew,we had shockingly good synergy
Andrew,and I feel like if we practice we'll be an actual serious dubs threat

Andrew,also the whole chunk that part is from is basically throwing shade at jews
Andrew,"which is really funny because it frequently calls them hypocrites but I sure haven't heard of anyone, no matter how devout, tear out an eye because they saw someone attractive"
Andrew,Yo but if every dude alive nutted at the same time
Andrew,what would happen?
Andrew,
Andrew,A lot of teachers would be fired
Andrew,no but like
Andrew,if all dudes were on a rocket ship
Andrew,and were facing dick down
Andrew,could the nutt blast get you to orbit?
Andrew,OR better yet
Andrew,If they were facing dick up
Andrew,Could they de orbit earth? 
Andrew,unlikely
Andrew,since each man's nut would have to propel their own body weight
Andrew,and adding more people would just make that less efficient

Andrew,ruining everything

Andrew,if you're not sure if you're gonna like it

Andrew,"and then you can decide to stop, or buy it, or do what I did and finish the first game but buy the other two"

Andrew,i ain't heard the word otaku in YEARS
Andrew,idk where you're getting your info from

Andrew,saying youre an otaku is tbh more cringe than saying you're a weeb
Andrew,cause atleast you arent in denail if you admit to being a weeb
Andrew,there's a real dictionary deffiniton of otaku and not weeb
Andrew,Well i just tried to kill myself
Andrew,i'm genuinely unsure if you guys know the difference.
Andrew,if you use a non english term to describe how much of an anime fan you are then you're a weeb
Andrew,"weeb, ottaku who cards they both cringe"
Andrew,you're all gay
Andrew,problem solved
Andrew,
Andrew,^
Andrew,so basically according to that video: Otakus don't exist in the west
Andrew,checkmate
Andrew,the weeb vs weeaboo thing seems to be true
Andrew,"basically otaku is just a cringe-y, outdated term that people in the west don't really say anymore"
Andrew,literally no one cares
Andrew,im just saying rainbowpixel is wrONG
Andrew,and im the more cultured weeb here
Andrew,
Andrew,Seems to fit
Andrew,no ?
Andrew,I mean what you just said now
Andrew,compare your message with his definition
Andrew,i never defined weeb
Andrew,"all it means is someone who likes anime, that's literally it"

Andrew,I've looked over some of the stuff for integration
Andrew,It seems conceptually easier than differential
Andrew,That is so wrong
Andrew,"But the ""shutup and calculate"" bits seem hard"
Andrew,
Andrew,Taking derivatives is pretty easy once you understand all the rules
Andrew,@The Rona
Andrew,Is my second comment correct?
Andrew,I mean
Andrew,It's just plug and chug really
Andrew,But the equations can get complicated
Andrew,so you have to be careful
Andrew,What do you mean by shutup and calculate?
Andrew,Definite integrals
Andrew,You mean using the fundamental theorem?
Andrew,I don't think so
Andrew,Definite integrals are the ones where you have limits of integration right?
Andrew,Definite integrals have a defined boundary
Andrew,yes
Andrew,Shutup and calculate is just another way of saying plug and chug
Andrew,When you have found the antiderivative of a given function
Andrew,and you want to calculate with the given boundary
Andrew,To solve those what I've been doing is integrating and then plugging the 2 limits into the new equation and subtracting one from the other.
Andrew,"It comes from physics land where students get to philosophical about what equations mean so the teachers shout ""SHUTUP AND CALCULATE!"""
Andrew,@Max is your school trimesters or semesters?
Andrew,semesters
Andrew,Ahh
Andrew,That's why you covered integration in calc 1
Andrew,We have 3 calc courses 
Andrew,So should Max
Andrew,I mean my school does have calc 3
Andrew,but I don't need to take it
Andrew,Calc 3 is multivariable calculus

Andrew,"Airheads God Tier, KitKat God tier, Reese dropped to very solid, Candy Cigarette dropped to suck"
Andrew,How the fuck are airheads god tier
Andrew,Airheads actually a tier above god tier
Andrew,Not just saying this to fuck with you guys
Andrew,This tier list is garbage
Andrew,Airheads are #1 candy
Andrew,Puts hot tamales in the pixie sticks tier this doesn’t even make any sense
Andrew,They suck just as much as pixie sticks
Andrew,I can understand why you disagree that it’s god tier but I’m genuinely baffled why airheads is rated as a low tier candy
Andrew,LAFFY TAFFY IS GOOD
Andrew,Unless you’re ranking it low cause like “oh it’s sticky if you hold it”
Andrew,WAY BETTER THAN AIRHEADS
Andrew,SMH
Andrew,Airheads taste good
Andrew,they aight
Andrew,this is the worst tiers list of all time
Andrew,Clearly the people who made this tier list had no hard candy proponents on their board of directors
Andrew,How biased
Andrew,How discriminatory
Andrew,how are dots and health very solid ???
Andrew,calling HR
Andrew,those are both pretty nasty
Andrew,There wasn't much hard candy here anyways
Andrew,Also laffy taffy and airheads suck
Andrew,settle this like civilized men and women
Andrew,fight to the death
Andrew,You have to put way too much effort into eating them for very little payoff
Andrew,LAFFY TAFFY TASTES SUPER GOOD WYM
Andrew,and theyre not hard to eat at all
Andrew,im boutta throw hands
Andrew,Throw them
Andrew,also fun dip is great dont @ me
Andrew,bro square up
Andrew,I'm squared up
Andrew,
Andrew,yea maybe fun dip and laffy taffy are good if you like to suffer
Andrew,Laffy Taffy better than airheads no cap
Andrew,they both trash
Andrew,No
Andrew,they just sugar
Andrew,if i wanna eat sugar
Andrew,i would just eat sugar
Andrew,They solid at lowest
Andrew,yea
Andrew,solidly in the lowest tier
Andrew,Reese's overrated
Andrew,that's patently false
Andrew,No

Andrew,Holy shit this is so bad
Andrew,How the fuck are pixie sticks in c
Andrew,Fun dip in b
Andrew,Holy shit
Andrew,sorry that you're wrong

Andrew,speedrun.com
Andrew,"Speedrunning leaderboards, resources, forums, and more!"
Andrew,This is the greatest disservice I have ever seen for left handed people
Andrew,We only get the left armrest
Andrew,Everyone else has two except for the poor right handed person beside me
Andrew,wouldn't that make it good for left handed people?
Andrew,yea wait hold up
Andrew,“””technically””” in the best (worst?) case where all seats are filled everyone else also only gets one armrest since you ain’t putting ur arm on someone else’s
Andrew,otherwise you get below average armrests
Andrew,oh snap it's elvin
Andrew,just sit in one of hte center seats if you want two armrests so bad
Andrew,the god
Andrew,alvin
Andrew,my favourite chipmunk
Andrew,dab
Andrew,also @Eric Working From Home ur candy tier list is high key awful
Andrew,"your argument that ""its just sugar so why wouldnt i jsut eat sugar"" is the dumbest thing ive ever heard"
Andrew,okay that was a joke
Andrew,but actually
Andrew,pixie sticks
Andrew,are just sugar in a paper tube
Andrew,crutches at school is not the move
Andrew,there is no appeal to that whatsoever
Andrew,also what jed said that too
Andrew,thats why they C tier
Andrew,"pixie sticks have no flavor, they are messy, and they make you want to die after eating them"
Andrew,you put reese way too high
Andrew,ok they arent messy
Andrew,if you make a mess with them you're big dubm
Andrew,reeses are clearly the best candy
Andrew,what if you wanted to die before eating them
Andrew,You literally can't eat them
Andrew,If they get any moisture in them whatsoever
Andrew,im convinced you two are disabled
Andrew,It's game over
Andrew,^
Andrew,dont spit into the tube then??????
Andrew,???
Andrew,You have to put the tube to your mouth to eat it
Andrew,you guys are also way too hung up on the pixie sticks i put them into C tier you monkeys
Andrew,It's inevitable
Andrew,oml how do you function
Andrew,you turn the tube over nd pour it onto ur tongue
Andrew,"Plus, even if you do get anything out of them"
Andrew,like you dont suck the shit outta a tube
Andrew,They don't even taste good
Andrew,the only candy that i would consider being worse than pixie sticks is hot tamales
Andrew,i put them C tier i dont know why you're so hung up on them
Andrew,its not like i put them in A tier
Andrew,In
Andrew,What
Andrew,World
Andrew,Are they better than
Andrew,Resses pieces
Andrew,??????????????????
Andrew,"hot tomales are like someone took mike and ikes and went ""yea these are incredibly disappointing, but i think we could make them worse"""
Andrew,cause reeses pieces are big 
Andrew,its like skittles meets the bad part of reeses
Andrew,Ok
Andrew,I just saw that you put York peppermint patties below them
Andrew,Your opinion on candy is so bad
Andrew,the fact that the bottom tier contained spicy candy is the only thing that saved yorks from bottom tier
Andrew,yorks are actually
Andrew,so
Andrew,fucking
Andrew,bad
Andrew,you know what
Andrew,i'd put them on the same level of hot tamales
Andrew,york peppermint patties are the most vile disgusting shit in hte world
Andrew,like peppermint marshmallow
Andrew,what the fuck
Andrew,youn know what fuck hot tamales im putting york patties in hte bottom tier
Andrew,Looking more into your tier list
Andrew,"bruh i dunno how i can trust anyone's opinion who puts CRUNCH above REECES, TWIX, HEATH, and SNICKERS"
Andrew,You have fundip above twix
Andrew,And twizzlers
Andrew,that might be the worst take in this whole list
Andrew,"hot take, twix bigly not good"
Andrew,twix kinda meh
Andrew,crunch is the worst chocolate bar free
Andrew,Also
Andrew,Skittles below fundip
Andrew,no
Andrew,What planet are you on?
Andrew,twix is a crunchy flavourless cookie pretending to be a chocolate bar by adding in infinitesimal amounts fo chocolate and caramel
Andrew,crunch is good
Andrew,idk whats wrong with you
Andrew,crunch is the kinda chocolate bar that you eat when you have given up on enjoying chocolate bars
Andrew,chris the kinda guy with such shit taste in candy he puts this stuff in S tier
Andrew,crunch is literally just a milk chocolate bar with crunchy pieces
Andrew,idk what you find wrong with it
Andrew,yes
Andrew,you guys also thuroughly did not give milk duds enough credit
Andrew,like unless you're lowering its rank cause its like cement for your teeth
Andrew,cause if you your list loses all credit then
Andrew,that is exactly why we put it lower
Andrew,you guys are goons
Andrew,also it snowing outside widepeepohappy
Andrew,we're not ranking how fucking ergonomic the candy is
Andrew,that is part of the consumption pprocess
Andrew,we ranking how good it tastes
Andrew,you moron
Andrew,you fool
Andrew,yall are some fucking reeses shills might I add
Andrew,when trick or treating I wouldn't even trade my reeses pieces for anything I'd literally give that shit away
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,i should've known Chris' Cnady tier list would be shit cause of that time when he asked what candy i wanted i said gummies and this MF got Sour Cola Bottle Gummies
Andrew,not even normal ones
Andrew,fucking

Andrew,cola

Andrew,@Matt  i got 11 lights
Andrew,9 regular and lux
Andrew,Just got back from a reddit event at the board game café. It was pretty fun. 
Andrew,what does that mean
Andrew,It means people in the Houston board games subreddit said that there would be a lot of people there that day and they invited others to come join them. The store even gave a discount if you mentioned the subreddit.
Andrew,nice
Andrew,
Andrew,I will be distancing myself from the other Zacks after discovering what shit taste they have
Andrew,Literally
Andrew,cereal
Andrew,
Andrew,This cereal tier list is pretty good
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,Much better than the candy one
Andrew,we made it with group think
Andrew,that's why kamerons bad opinions didn't make it to light
Andrew,
Andrew,fuuuuck the internet historian just released an hour long video
Andrew,but I need to write an essy
Andrew,oops
Andrew,N O M A N S S K Y
Andrew,whatabouttit
Andrew,Internet historians video is about that
Andrew,"Corn flakes isnt an ""organic"" ceral tf?"
Andrew,
Andrew,well it is tasteless
Andrew,"Also the ""organic"" tier was a meme"
Andrew,ah like my meatloaf ingredient tier
Andrew,but also i heard feeding people grape nuts is banned by hte geneva convention
Andrew,"and @Rotomotorz corn flakes are tasteless to stop masturbation, its by design"
Andrew,
Andrew,god yall so uneducated
Andrew,"It might just be that your distaste for corn flakes is not by accident though, as Mr Kellogg actually developed cornflakes primarily to stop children from masturbating!  He had particular ideas about masturbation, writing, “if illicit commerce of the sexes is a heinous sin, self-pollution is a crime doubly abominable.” He felt that certain foods inspired ‘self-pollution’, like spicy foods,  meat, and generally anything that tasted too good. One of the biggest fights he had with his brother, and business partner, was over adding sugar to cornflakes. Kellogg’s brother had the (right) idea that sugar would vastly improve the taste of the cereal, but Kellogg stood by his original vision, that of plain and boring, sexual desire killing food, so the flakes remained unsweetened."
Andrew,also hot take
Andrew,french topast crunch
Andrew,not that good
Andrew,That's the hottest take
Andrew,Because it is so wrong
Andrew,undeniably worse that cinnamon toast crunch at the very least
Andrew,atleast the latter has flavour
Andrew,wait this corn flake story is hilarious
Andrew,kellogg is actually stupid
Andrew,well he became very rich and thne very dead
Andrew,@Eric Working From Home your list is bad
Andrew,My list may be bad but I stand by French toast crunch being at most B tier material
Andrew,gamers
Andrew,non-gamers
Andrew,D:
Andrew,daheck the iceborn monster hunter dlc is $40
Andrew,It's a whole new storyline with a bunch of new monsters and more
Andrew,New area aswell
Andrew,so like
Andrew,1/5th of a game
Andrew,theres like 12 new monsters
Andrew,31 total
Andrew,so like 2/5th of a game
Andrew,get it right
Andrew,
Andrew,Joined the server.
Andrew,yo i told you guys french toast cruch was top teir
Andrew,it really aint tho
Andrew,"cheap, tasty, affordable for a broke student living by the paycheck ."
Andrew,
Andrew,the community consistently ranks it B-C tier
Andrew,lucky charms is too sweet.
Andrew,it is cheap and affordable
Andrew,honey nuts is s
Andrew,but it is flavourless
Andrew,It's literally not flavourless though
Andrew,Like what
Andrew,naw. you can taste the honey
Andrew,that's what makes it good
Andrew,Do you have a tounge?
Andrew,must've had a bad box at your place then during meetup
Andrew,also life is really good too
Andrew,cause it was like flavourless cardboard cubes
Andrew,frosted flakes is also way too sweet
Andrew,nah forsted flakes S tier
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,cheerios is tasteless
Andrew,you're saying everything is too sweet
Andrew,i think maybe you just like mild flavours
Andrew,either tasteless or too sweet
Andrew,maybe thast why you like french toast crunch
Andrew,bruh. i never said frootloops was too sweet
Andrew,frootloops is S
Andrew,that we can agree on
Andrew,high A
Andrew,jsut cause hte basis for S tier is frosted flakes
Andrew,if we put frootloops in S we gotta make a new tier above S
Andrew,frosted flakes becomes so spongey after like 30 seconds
Andrew,yeah thats the best way to eat cereal
Andrew,leave it in hte milk for like 1 minute so its no longer crunchy
Andrew,thats my second hot take of the day
Andrew,no
Andrew,This is why we ignore your opinions
Andrew,no. crunchy cereal with the slight taste of milk is the best
Andrew,so you're rather have mini wheats like right as you put the milk in when the inside is still fully dry
Andrew,we fuck mini wheats
Andrew,rather than let the milk permeate it
Andrew,kuz it's disgusting
Andrew,this fucker eats his mini wheats dry
Andrew,
Andrew,mini wheats is disgusting
Andrew,wtfd
Andrew,benson your taste in cereal is so shit
Andrew,at least i have a tongue kuz i can actually taste the honey in the honey nut
Andrew,im aware theres honey in honey nut
Andrew,i jsut still do not enjoy it
Andrew,also. more people here prefer crunchy cereal here.
Andrew,im no longer on hte milky vs Dry cereal debate
Andrew,mini wheats are good
Andrew,they sweetness doesn't go well with the milk. if you're unfortunate enough to have 3% it tastes even worse. at that point you're eating cream with laxities.
Andrew,im like 90% sure your tastebuds jsut finna dont work
Andrew,you out here saying everyhitng too sweet
Andrew,if it has even a semblance of flavour
Andrew,i'm probably more sensitive to sweetness than you are. also not everything is too sweet. plus i never said mini wheats was too sweet.
Andrew,
Andrew,ok maybe that i coulda worded that better
Andrew,mini wheats tastes like frosting. which doesnt go well with milk. it's like mixing mint and chocolate
Andrew,bruh
Andrew,you ever heard of mint chocolate chip
Andrew,or andes mints
Andrew,i have. but mint seems to ruin chocolate for me
Andrew,I think your taste buds are broke
Andrew,this guys taste buds def broke as hell
Andrew,does cilantro taste slightly like mint to anyone here?
Andrew,shit tastes like soap
Andrew,soap* i meant soap
Andrew,link the teirlist website
Andrew,for cereal
Andrew,nvm found it
Andrew,
Andrew,lucky charms i used to like.
Andrew,but i cant eat it anymore.
Andrew,krave is probably my favourite
Andrew,and if the nesquick cereal was here it'd go in A teir
Andrew,wrong
Andrew,so wrong
Andrew,i really like my milk.
Andrew,if i'm gunna eat frosted flakes i'm gunna dump my milk with my unsweetend dark roast coffee
Andrew,"bruh honey nut cheerios definitely ""ruins the milk"""
Andrew,i see your point. but it's not as bad as frosted flakes
Andrew,benson you put raisin bran over corn flakes
Andrew,you opinion literally has negative validity
Andrew,Devon you don't get to speak
Andrew,actually shut up chris your shit taste extends beyond cereals
Andrew,atleast benson kept his terrible taste localized to cereal
Andrew,
Andrew,@The Rona
Andrew,easy as fuck dude
Andrew,all we needed was one less chris

Andrew,fearless ideas now that's a class i wanna take when i come up with ideas the amount of fear that comes along with them is just simply overwhelming. What a visionary but seriously though Kameron do you need to bring something or is it optional. If it's not optional then bring something that you think is cool and come up with a way in witch it effected you.

Andrew,10 mins
Andrew,How's the novel coming along
Andrew,"@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home Just played another game of Agricola, this time with the revised version (the one we played was the original), and thought you might want to hear my thoughts. 
1. The revised version is definitely an improvement upon the original. Everyone at the table had useful cards to play and some decent synergies; card quality just felt higher overall.
2. I think revised version + draft would be even better, as to allow for even better card synergies.
3. Restocking the spaces in the physical version is way less tedious than in TTS (not much we can do about that though).
4. Having a plan for food and getting it setup before the first harvest is VERY important, as having to waste actions on food later is painful when better action cards flip.
5. Overly focusing on one thing is bad. One player went totally in on the farming strategy and ended the game with 11 grain and 7 vegetables (max scoring is at 8 grain and 4 vegetables). While this is impressive, all the excess crops didn't help in the score department and this player didn't win.
6. I overall had a lot of fun and think we shouldn't give up on this game if we can find a way to use the revised edition cards."

Andrew,and if nothing else it's visually amazing
Andrew,"and from talking to people who know more about the current guilty gear and more from people who've played the demo of the new one, it's still looking like a solid game, just not really in the same vein as the previous ones (apparently this one is just gonna be ""better street fighter"" if it continues in its current state)"

Andrew,you have no money
Andrew,when you got locked in the store someone took your wallet aswell
Andrew,then whats he doing there
Andrew,are you dumb
Andrew,I would eat once I was hungry. There is no way they could charge me for a crime if they locked me in. I would win.
Andrew,browsing
Andrew,what are you winning
Andrew, Cops are gone 
Andrew,The court case
Andrew,They would settle it with me. They would have serious bad press to worry about if they locked me in. They would probably pay me to keep my mouth shut and not care if I munched a few chips to keep myself alive.

Andrew,Ike + Bowser would be a fun duo

Andrew,I was gonna have nothing to do all morning but one of my friends was on my flight so we played friendlies for a few hours
Andrew,Nice
Andrew,It was super short it kinda felt like I didn't go anywhere
Andrew,It was like an hour and a half
Andrew,Yea that's not too long
Andrew,It would've taken like 10 hours to drive tho
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,Short flights always feel weird cause the check-in and waiting for the plane always takes longer than the flight itself
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,We had a bunch of smash players I know on the flight
Andrew,Fat Goku sat like 2 seats away from me
Andrew,That's sick
Andrew,Who did you play friendlies with
Andrew,Also I'm mega bored just waiting for my ENT

Andrew,You forgot Google aswell
Andrew,No I didn't
Andrew,i cant believe berkshire hathaway would hire someone who does that
Andrew,also yes Oakland is pretty ghetto be careful
Andrew,it's like 90% very sketchy and after the first time I went there I decided it'd be the bright move to just uber both in and out
Andrew,also like two people were murdered there in the four months I was nearby
Andrew,Yeah I'm not planning on being anywhere other than the bnb and venue after today
Andrew,You forgot Amazon and Netflix
Andrew,i heard there was a round 1 near there

Andrew,Did someone say furry 
Andrew,
Andrew,The Aussie player I'm seeded to play is fucking good
Andrew,But he's in my bnb and I'm getting the download
Andrew,stream it
Andrew,"Just played some more agricola, this time with the school board game club. Really enjoying the game."
Andrew,board game club 
Andrew,More like
Andrew,Board game club 
Andrew,Lmao my sponsor really out here dropping me the morning of genesis
Andrew,Oof
Andrew,Place higher than 16th and show them who they shouldnt have dropped
Andrew,It's only cause I called him out about getting the money he said I'd get in October
Andrew,Hmm that sounds illegal on their part
Andrew,I mean he said that atk doesn't deserve me and doesn't think I'm a good fit
Andrew,Do you have email/message chains?
Andrew,Well he sent me the money today
Andrew,Aight that's not too bad then
Andrew,But it still might be worth going public with provided that's not a breach of contract
Andrew,"Yeah just kind of stupid that he'd just drop me with no discussion, I've literally been with the org for over a year now and joined at it's conception"
Andrew,So here's the funny thing
Andrew,"""They didn't pay me and when I gave them shit about it they fired me for 'not being a good fit'"" is kind of a huge red flag"
Andrew,I never signed a contract so I can say whatever I want
Andrew,"Like, wanting money from your sponsor is kinda how sponsors work"
Andrew,I'd say don't go overboard but it's an important cautionary tale
Andrew,Yeah I'm probably gonna tweet and just say that I've been let go and the circumstances behind it
Andrew,Yaw
Andrew,"Be honest, don't be overly vicious (don't want to alienate potential future sponsors), but also make it clear that there appears to be a correlation between wanting to be paid and not being a good fit"
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,F. Sorry to hear that Jed
Andrew,"It's okay, I was kind of thinking about it anyways cause I was getting really frustrated"
Andrew,It took bemmie almost 5 months to get me the money
Andrew,And I would ask kindly once a month
Andrew,Until last month u started to show I was getting upset
Andrew,Cause he keeps running all these tournaments with thousands of dollars on the line
Andrew,How much money did you get anyways?
Andrew,150 for one event
Andrew,Which is better than what most rivals sponsorships do
Andrew,also do they handle travel fees and stuff?
Andrew,So it was a hella good deal and that's why I wanted to stay
Andrew,They way that they did it was they reimbursed half my flight
Andrew,But I had to buy the ticket and send them the reciept
Andrew,are they still gonna reimburse your genesis travel?
Andrew,I highly doubt it
Andrew,We barely discussed it
Andrew,"I said ""I assume genesis reimbursement is out of the question as I still haven't gotten the reimbursement from heatwave"""
Andrew,yikes
Andrew,That's a big F
Andrew,"although now he has an excuse to be like ""yup not paying for genesis"""
Andrew,"also that's probably something worth mentioning in your post ""so I flew out to genesis while still on the team and they're not gonna be paying my flight"""
Andrew,Yeah I'm gonna write it up after I've thought about it
Andrew,One of my now ex teammates is at genesis and I'm gonna try and find him
Andrew,Not sure if this is real homies but stay safe

Andrew,I just saw an article by a veteran Terraforming Mars player that said building cities is one of the worst strategies in the game. I'm not sure how that could be given that my city spam in the second game we played seemed so effective.
Andrew,I guess we never really understood how to play the game at all
Andrew,Someday I'll probably try it again
Andrew,"Now that I'm thinking about it more, I feel like I actually probably liked the game, but that feeling was overshadowed by the rather negative table atmosphere and how much everyone else seemed to be miserable."
Andrew,"Logically, it has two of my favorite things in a game, drafting and engine building, so I should probably like it."
Andrew,"I think that if I could be shown/show myself with more plays that the game has more viable strategies than city spam like that article claims, I could probably have fun playing the game."

Andrew,hbox has really bad di
Andrew,also marth puff on dreamland looks practically impossible
Andrew,even tho zain is winning
Andrew,he is just way better
Andrew,Hbox is carried by puff
Andrew,I feel like he's just gotten really complacent
Andrew,he dragged puff up for years
Andrew,but now that he's on top he's getting lazy
Andrew,I would say he actually used to be carried by puff even more than now. See his skill with other characters over time as evidence.
Andrew,his secondaries have always kinda sucked?
Andrew,They are way better now
Andrew,but in general I'd say he is the reason he's carried by puff
Andrew,"not only is dreamland busted for puff, but it also kills the momentum of the other player"
Andrew,like he made puff into a character who can carry
Andrew,and then stopped pushing her as a character
Andrew,and now he's letting his past work carry him
Andrew,and now everyone's figuring out how to counter that
Andrew,bro he literally never used the sing punish on marth until like last year
Andrew,thats how little he innovates
Andrew,"wow, one (1) new piece of tech"
Andrew,naw it was evidence for your point moron
Andrew,yeah I was agreeing
Andrew,he stopped innovating after like 2017
Andrew,hbox is honestly so lame
Andrew,I would say that at that point in time he was carrying puff but now he's just letting puff carry him
Andrew,the worst guy to be the best melee player
Andrew,never plays friendlies
Andrew,at least people are figuring him out
Andrew,doesnt innovate or play to the meta
Andrew,camps when he is losing
Andrew,like I think unless he starts working hard again he's not holding onto #1 for another year
Andrew,think about how unstoppable he looked in early 2019
Andrew,and now he's got a whole bunch of frequent losses
Andrew,look how much data he gets by playing games on dreamland
Andrew,"zain, wizzy for a bit, hbox sometimes, especially leffen"
Andrew,i dunno if winning a game on dreamland vs hbox is even a good idea
Andrew,"Go Zain, saving melee"
Andrew,"and he's got hax, leffen, fiction all chilling down there"
Andrew,it'd be fairly insane if he even makes grands
Andrew,dammit I want to make dinner but there's like no sets I don't want to watch
Andrew,I guess I'll wait for hbox fiction
Andrew,fuck which set is next
Andrew,can I just leave during the ad break?
Andrew,but it's probably gonna be leffen hax
Andrew,smash gg says that leffen hax is next
Andrew,darn
Andrew,HAX$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Andrew,tweet incoming 
Andrew,THE ROOM WAS COLD
Andrew,idk if the box should be leagl. in my opinion the set should be replayed?

5th ain't too bad to start my comeback off with I guess. We'll take it all things considered!"

Andrew,"Beating the World’s Best at Super Smash Bros. Melee with Deep Reinforcement
Learning"
Andrew,@solarlight
Andrew,Andrew what is this?
Andrew,
Andrew,Can you read?
Andrew,"One particularly clever player found that the simple strategy of crouching at the edge of the stage caused the network to behave very oddly, refusing to attack and eventually KOing itself by falling off the other side of the stage. One hypothesis to explain this weakness is the lack of diversity in training - since the network only played against old copies of itself, it never encountered such a degenerate strategy"
Andrew,absolutely large brain
Andrew,RIGHT
Andrew,Its a cool paper

Andrew,What
Andrew,?
Andrew,so
Andrew,fuck essays
Andrew,True
Andrew,Settle a debate https://www.strawpoll.me/19347040
Andrew,THe is our high five phrase
Andrew,"Vote Now! [Up high, down low fakes out high five too slow] [Up high, down low, in the middle fakes out high five too slow]"
Andrew,It’s supposed to say the fake out not “the is our” autocorrect
Andrew,Yo wait
Andrew,who the fuck out here saying in the middle
Andrew,Cause Ashley says you don’t say in the middle but I’m saying you gotta day in the middle so that you have proper rhyming sequence
Andrew,Literally never met anybody why doesn’t do in the middle
Andrew,Tf
Andrew,Wait
Andrew,Also Chris don’t vote I want to know what the general populace does and you have time and time again shown you don’t do a single normal thing
Andrew,How does saying in the middle make it a rhyming sequence
Andrew,It literally doesn't rhyme
Andrew,"Cause it it goes 
Up high (not rhyming line)
Down low (setup for the rhyme)
In the middle (additional line to keep the rhymes on alternating lines)
Too slow (Rhyme Payoff)"
Andrew,If you lead a single not rhyming line into two back to back rhyming lines it messes with the flow
Andrew,I guess that makes sense
Andrew,Listen to any song
Andrew,Okay
Andrew,I feel like your thing works better in text
Andrew,I feel like it works better in practice aswell
Andrew,Nah
Andrew,Cause the rhyme part is tacked onto the middle line
Andrew,So it doesn't feel like payoff for the down low line
Andrew,you feel
Andrew,The only additional payoff of not adding in the middle is that if you fake out the low high five it leaves their hand lingering in a downward instead of horizontal motion
Andrew,You don’t need lay-off on every like
Andrew,Payoff*
Andrew,Line*
Andrew,"Like example
Life is old there (spacing)
Older than the trees (setup)
Younger than the mountains (spacing)
Blowing like a breeze (payoff)"
Andrew,There no payoff on the mountains line cause it’s added as spacing
Andrew,I think the clear distinction here is that your example is a song while the high five action is not
Andrew,bruh who be saying in the middle
Andrew,You're trying to turn it into a song
Andrew,probably dumb people
Andrew,But it doesn't need to be
Andrew,It’s not a song it’s a rhyme sequence though
Andrew,Genuinely never met people who didn’t say in the middle until now tf
Andrew,Well here's the thing with that
Andrew,You mostly do this joke to kids
Andrew,So your family probably played it on you using the middle version
Andrew,You aren't exposed to how other people say it because the other people you are exposed to in your life probably realize that you are too old to fall for the joke
Andrew,I feel like the desire for there to be patterns in the rhyming sequence is a natural thing not something you learn like why “tock tick” sounds worse than “tick tock” there’s an actual like psychological reason for that
Andrew,Ergo you never meet anyone that would say it the other way
Andrew,Idk about you bro but I still be pulling the fake out high fives to this day
Andrew,That’s how we got onto this topic of discussion
Andrew,in the middle breaks the rythymic sequence which imo sounds worse
Andrew,though ive heard both
Andrew,That just wrong tho
Andrew,It doesn’t break the sequence the fuck?
Andrew,I think it could be due to kids not picking up on the rhyme the way you propose it though
Andrew,Not adding it breaks the sequence
Andrew,It's more clear that the rhyme is intended when the middle portion is excluded
Andrew,To kids at least
Andrew,What dumbass kids are you dealing with
Andrew,The fuck
Andrew,"yeah ""up high"" ""down low"" and ""too slow"" are all two syllable"
Andrew,If you play a kid country roads are they not gonna notice trees rhymes with breeze
Andrew,"""in the middle"" is 4"
Andrew,It’s the bridging line Greg
Andrew,Cause I was doing it to Ashley and when I said “down low” she slapped my hand with the might of a thousand suns then was like “why didn’t you try and pull your hand away” and I was like cause I pull it away in the middle and that’s how we got here
Andrew,That line is from way back I just had to keep deleting and refusing it cause Greg kept saying some@dumb shit that I had to respond to right away
Andrew,Hence why it doesn’t make sense in the conversation
Andrew,fwiw i’ve always heard it w/ “in the middle”

Andrew,@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home @Rotomotorz Just finished an in person game of Terra Mystica. I played the Fakirs to handicap myself but still got  133. Pretty happy with that score given how bad they are.
Andrew,wow the coronavirus is really getting to max
Andrew,I should have gotten 136 but I forgot to take water 1 for my sanctuary
Andrew,
Andrew,tragic
Andrew,OH SHIT HES SO WIDE
Andrew,network wide asf
Andrew,"Carpet flight, earth 1, and dwelling round meant I scored 44 points in the last turn plus another 8 for passing with the sanctuary stronghold bonus card with both in play."
Andrew,"On another note, I'm even more happy with the score when I consider I had both neighboring colors in play (which the Fakirs especially dislike)."
Andrew,welp I got a new celeste PB but I'm real sad

Andrew,Bro that’s fucked
Andrew,hunt him down
Andrew,How does one manage to hit the side of a car in a driveway
Andrew,These are the people you share the road with everyday
Andrew,"Could of been an animal, or some dude with a bat"
Andrew,bro how an animal bouta do that
Andrew,there aren't like bison walking around in florida
Andrew,Humans are animals
Andrew,
Andrew,Human drive car
Andrew,car hit car
Andrew,i mena a deer could do that
Andrew,^
Andrew,That was my original idea
Andrew,It looks all scratched up though at the bottom so it looks like it was acutally a car
Andrew,how tf did that other car even get onto your driveway tbh
Andrew,like wtf were they doing
Andrew,the funniest thing about it is that I dont have a normal driveway
Andrew,like my car was pretty far from the road
Andrew,Draw a diagram
Andrew,
Andrew,Wow
Andrew,That was really fast
Andrew,and detailed
Andrew,You should be an artist
Andrew,but real talk I was sideways up by the door
Andrew,and even then the road is a good couple feet behind me
Andrew,Damn sucks dude
Andrew,"Okay, theory time"
Andrew,Some guy needed to turn around
Andrew,so he pulls into your driveway to do it
Andrew,hits your car
Andrew,Theory time over
Andrew,nah apparently people heard the guy speeding down the road and slamming into my car

Andrew,Who here has played the Steam version of UNO?
Andrew,I wasn't even aware that there was a steam version of UNO. I've played it on tabletop simulator though.
Andrew,"I think it's only like... $5-10...?
I've seen a few YouTubers play it and it actually looks kind fun."
Andrew,It's got special rules you can enable... And different game settings with special cards.
Andrew,"For example, 7s & 0s
Play a 7, you swap hands with someone
Play a 0, all hands rotate in the direction of the turn order."
Andrew,Frostbite uno night @Tabletop
Andrew,ok

Andrew,jesus fuck what
Andrew,I'm watching dbfz world tour finals
Andrew,grand finals
Andrew,go1 vs fenritti
Andrew,"game one: go1 perfects fenritti
game two: fenritti perfects go1"
Andrew,what the actual fuck
Andrew,was it like 100-0 both games lol?
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,lol
Andrew,do you know how rare a single perfect is in dbfz?
Andrew,insanely rare
Andrew,I don't watch this game that often but I've literally never seen one until today
Andrew,well i mean if you can 100-0 i cant imagine its that rare
Andrew,"""If you can do it, it's not rare"""
Andrew,a 100-0 is a guaranteed perfect
Andrew,
Andrew,you jsut gotta land hte first hit
Andrew,you dingus
Andrew,when i say 100-0 i mean you hit a guy when hes full health and fully kill him without dropping combo
Andrew,"you can only 100-0 with sparking (which is a once-per-game thing, and also often used defensively) and hella bar"
Andrew,and only on one of their three characters
Andrew,most of the time it's 2-3 openings per character
Andrew,so you pretty much need 5-9 straight openings to perfect someone
Andrew,"depending on your team (damage-heavy vs neutral/mix-heavy vs balanced) and meter management (meter for damage vs meter for mixups, sparking for defense vs damage vs pressure)"
Andrew,nerd
Andrew,@Master Memers I have it on good authority that @The Rona is the suck dick man
Andrew,https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/662012908284280853.gif?v=1
Andrew,COCK
Andrew,you're the suck cock man?
Andrew,cheese is kinda insane at sm64
Andrew,
Andrew,oof
Andrew,I got an A so I'm fine but I feel bad for the others
Andrew,(this was a Gen Chem II test)
Andrew,it might get curved
Andrew,I've never seen a math/science test get curved
Andrew,don't you curve by the highest grade tho
Andrew,I remember one of my old housemates calling her parents about getting a 28% on a midterm but that was okay since the class average was 22%
Andrew,lol
Andrew,damn
Andrew,and that was engineering
Andrew,but I guess it might depend on the school for what gets curved
Andrew,"but still, odds are if it gets curved max's grade goes up"
Andrew,I know my school curves business classes like accounting
Andrew,"Also, my grade was 100 so it cannot go up"
Andrew,ah well
Andrew,This was supposedly the easiest test too
Andrew,The class may shrink to a tiny size by the end of the semester if this trend continues
Andrew,my guess is that those 6 people who failed are dragging the average down since most people seem to have done aight
Andrew,they've probably given up on the course but haven't dropped yet
Andrew,"meanwhile, in courses I wish I could drop, currently working on an assignment where this is one part of it:"
Andrew,I have no idea what 'layout 2' is
Andrew,this is the only use of the word 'layout' in the entire assignment
Andrew,hmmm
Andrew,so I've just decided to make my best guess at what they want here
Andrew,"unfortunately, the whole assignment is like this"
Andrew,so I'm making my best guess at like... half
Andrew,this course is terrible but also mandatory
Andrew,What course is this?
Andrew,Software Requirements
Andrew,it's all about how to plan software
Andrew,"with the caveat that this is not, in any way, how anything works at any actual company"
Andrew,sounds useless
Andrew,it's a course about the pipe dream of how we wish people told us to make software
Andrew,and the prof uses the word 'requirements' more than the word 'the'
Andrew,it's 80% common sense and 20% buzzwords
Andrew,I wish I still had classes where I could pass the tests on common sense alone
Andrew,yes but also it's mind-numbingly boring and a shocking amount of work
Andrew,I've been working on this assignment since like 2
Andrew,ouch
Andrew,most of that time has been consulting other people in the class and trying to put together a picture of wtf the prof wants us to do
Andrew,Unclear instructions are the actual worst
Andrew,You seem to get them a lot of the time
Andrew,at this point we've all given up actually figuring anything out and we're just doing going with our best assumptions about what he wants
Andrew,I hope he enjoys the eight pages of BS he's gonna be getting
Andrew,also I hope that he stops doing the thing where whenever he posts the slides for a lecture it's all the slides for the whole course up until that point so you have to scroll through an increasingly long series of slides to reach the new stuff
Andrew,"I may complain about my school a lot, but the one thing I will give it credit for is that the professors are of shockingly high quality on average."
Andrew,mine are usually solid but there's generally one disaster per term
Andrew,I've been told that's because my school attracts people who like the teaching part of being a prof rather than the research part.
Andrew,"and yes, it's usually the researchers"
Andrew,im zack's professor
Andrew,Someone in my chem group chat just says he got a zero on the exam
Andrew,i hate zack
Andrew,I hope he read that one wrong
Andrew,He did indeed
Andrew,he actually got an A
Andrew,the only test i've ever passed was a test on how to fail tests

Andrew,"there were group fuckups and I had to move to another group, they didn't change my group assignment in the system but said they'd match my final project's marks with the new group's"
Andrew,that never fucking happened
Andrew,final project was worth 30% of my grade
Andrew,and with a zero on the system
Andrew,I failed the course
Andrew,thank god I have emails from the prof/TAs saying they'd do it
Andrew,I've probably spent several hours over the last few weeks deliberating on what game to buy (board game) now that I have access to a place to play them weekly. I feel like my inability to choose is killing me but these games are just so expensive.

Andrew,coward
Andrew,
Andrew,
Andrew,"so quick question. Any of you guys know of a kind of sweet candy/chocolate that has cream in the middle? I know it sounds like a weird question, but I'm doing research.

and I want a serious answer......"
Andrew,like a twinky?
Andrew,"maybe, but not quite"
Andrew,I mean I might know the thing you're thinking of but just not immediately connecting the dots
Andrew,"I'm not sure if something like this exists.... but I'm thinking of something that's kind of like the length of a churro, but cream filled"
Andrew,crunchy? soft?
Andrew,
Andrew,maybe more like crunchy?
Andrew,these things?
Andrew,yeah something like that
Andrew,it would be better if they were like a type of candy though.... but I can make this work if nothing else
Andrew,happy to kinda sorta help
Andrew,
Andrew,What is this for??
Andrew,a valentines gift
Andrew,
Andrew,For someone?
Andrew,"yeah, a co-worker"
Andrew,Oooh :0
Andrew,good luck!
Andrew, love is in the air
Andrew,huzzah ya boi is getting the runaround by campus faculty
Andrew,still stuck waiting on that one prof to fix my grade so that I'm not failing
Andrew,found out that half the systems show me failing another course but the other half show me passing it so I'm also waiting on a fix for that
Andrew,found out that my credits from the summer school I took back in 2016 never got transferred so I'm short six credits (equivalent to one full-year course) to graduate unless I can get that fixed and no one seems quite sure how that process is gonna work so I keep getting passed off to new people
Andrew,and now all the faculty offices are closed so instead of shlepping all around campus I have to send emails which are inevitably gonna get ignored for awhile
Andrew,Damn that shit must be fucking infuriating hope you get it all sorted out
Andrew,yeh
Andrew,I've at least done all I can for today until people email me back
Andrew,Zack boi where are you going to work?
Andrew,Where do you WANT* to work?
Andrew,fuckin anywhere at this point
Andrew,but honestly in the here and now my focus is on making sure I can dodge all these weird administrative fuckups and actually graduate
Andrew,"cause it'd be real awkward to get hired and be like ""surprise I gotta do one more term of school cause my credits ain't got transferred properly"""
Andrew,Well just remember you don't have to be honest on your resume. You can put you have your degree then explain the situation
Andrew,IF THEY FUCK UP
Andrew,I might be wrong but I feel like resumes are just ice breakers
Andrew,"And if you are honest but can't even get your foot in the door, you will never have a chance to prove yourself "
Andrew,GOOD LUCK BUDDY
Andrew,I would hire you 
Andrew,Just finished my first calculus 2 test (was an online class so I could have procrastinated in to next Monday at the latest) . Now I can go play terra mystica again tomorrow guilt free

Andrew,"like actual pain, not just cold"
Andrew,Why the fuck is gotta be -22 on the day I wear the distressed denim smh
Andrew,Bro I just saw some mother fucker in shorts
Andrew,ballsy
Andrew,I respect it
Andrew,I knew someone in elementary school who did that
Andrew,killed like 2/3 of the nerves in his legs and he doesn't feel cold anymore

Andrew,but ill sauce you ip and you can join the next time its up 
Andrew,
Andrew,I'll play mc
Andrew,okay I'm back @Cs:go
Andrew,"i would be interested, but I think people are gone"
Andrew,You're dumb
Andrew,is that a yay or nay from you smith
Andrew,"When I ordered something from Amazon it said the delivery would be Sunday. The page was still up and it said it could ""ship by Saturday if you order within the next 6 hours!"" So I cancelled my order and ordered again lol. I have no idea why this happened."
Andrew,The time gap between the orders was like 9 hours
Andrew,"So I'm going to visit my brother over reading week, checked and apparently there was supposed to be a 2-3 hour wait to get through customs"
Andrew,There was no line at all
Andrew,My flight doesn't leave for another two hours
Andrew,F
Andrew,I'm sitting in a very overpriced restaurant staring down this bottle of fiji water they leave at every table and presumably have to pay like $15 if you open
Andrew,go to a cheaper restaurant and feast on something?
Andrew,They're all super expensive
Andrew,Or moderately expensive and serve tiny portions
Andrew,Feels Airport Man
Andrew,And I haven't eaten yet today and my flight keeps getting delayed
Andrew,So I'm willing to pay the five extra dollars for bigger better food
Andrew,sounds like a plan
Andrew,hbox legitimately looks unbeatable
Andrew,he dominated 4 players who have historically gave him at least a bit of trouble
Andrew,i dunno if fox beats puff tbh
Andrew,not in b05 with sdi existing
Andrew,I think fox is the best character against puff whether he wins or not
Andrew,Puff is just overpowered. Puff gets to play brawl while everyone else plays melee.
Andrew,amsa is sick
Andrew,like he lost but he's sick
Andrew,oh hope he gets better
Andrew,@Cs:go
Andrew,"If we get some peeps, sure"
Andrew,ok
Andrew,@trashpanda risky rain with me and devon
Andrew,?
Andrew,@Homies  we play MvM at some point tomorrow
Andrew,Tomorrow is Summit finals day
Andrew,No
Andrew,Your point
Andrew,I'm going to be occupied with that
Andrew,Just don't
Andrew,In addition to other things
Andrew,Watch vods
Andrew,
Andrew,no
Andrew,
Andrew,max gay
Andrew,
Andrew,this summit final bracket is hype
Andrew,zain plup
Andrew,facts
Andrew,hbox maNG
Andrew,anyone can win tbh
Andrew,maNG
Andrew,BUMPED CAPS
Andrew,again
Andrew,also 9 top 10 players left
Andrew,no m2k lol
Andrew,wait there are like no top sheiks anymore
Andrew,And then I said
Andrew,Penis
Andrew,yeah same
Andrew,i think that if fox players win game 1 vs puff/marth they should just sd 4 times in the counterpick
Andrew,like no meme
Andrew,its more important to preserve momentum than to maybe win on the counterpick
Andrew,I think people prone to tilting might do this but I don't think everyone should.
Andrew,i do
Andrew,at top level
Andrew,its literally not worth the risk
Andrew,fox never beats zain on fd
Andrew,vs marth maybe I could see that everyone should
Andrew,not vs puff though
Andrew,even if you win dreamland
Andrew,you have to play it again
Andrew,giving hbox so much momentum and info
Andrew,Maybe I'm biased because Dreamland is my favorite stage but I would never forfeit that game.
Andrew,and it burns the fox player out
Andrew,making them prone to make more mistakes in future games
Andrew,The fact that this is even a discussion means the ruleset is broken
Andrew,bans
Andrew,id like to see the stats
Andrew,of how much hbox wins on the fox's counterpick
Andrew,after winning the second dreamland game
Andrew,i guarantee its real high
Andrew,why not just stand still on the counterpick
Andrew,like honestly losing dreamland the first time might be better sometimes
Andrew,plup is godlike
Andrew,I think this is the first win vs Hbox since Plup won genesis
Andrew,hbox hasnt lost so badly since mang0 at birthday bash
Andrew,ggs
Andrew,dreamland 
Andrew,so dumb
Andrew,puff dies early
Andrew,that was a good tourney still
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,Sup everyone?

Andrew,"In an extremely ill-advised decision, I'm currently at a casino with my brother"
Andrew,Time to lose $80usd
Andrew,win money
Andrew,Good advice
Andrew,Just think of gambling as paying for entertainment rather than a way to earn money
Andrew, 
Andrew,Well yeah
Andrew,Also a way to make him stop bothering me about going to the casino
Andrew,"I've heard that helps soften the blow of the inevitable loss and prevent going in too much to ""win it back"""
Andrew,Yeah
Andrew,I've committed to losing $80 and if I lose less it's an accomplishment
Andrew,Good mindset
Andrew,Bit of a roller coaster so far but atm I'm only down $4
Andrew,Nice
Andrew,$4 is not much
Andrew,Lost like $50 on one hand tho
Andrew,Playing poker?
Andrew,he was playing blind and got triple sevens
Andrew,What moron plays blind
Andrew,"Yeah, Texas hold em"
Andrew,Texas hold em is the only valid poker
Andrew,Hes doing really well
Andrew,Could afford to play blind one hand
Andrew,Poker is the only gambling I would consider since I can use skill to win
Andrew,"Yeah, to a point at least"
Andrew,I'm alright at the game but have never played with real money
Andrew,I've played for really small money once
Andrew,First time at a casino tho
Andrew,Im out lol

Andrew,This is Zack we are talking about
Andrew,"@Homies I've recently discovered a game that I think could be great fun for our group if everyone is willing to learn it. It features highly asymmetric factions (apparently balanced), information trading, treachery, and alliance making and breaking. Tonight I am pretty free if people want to get together and play it on tabletop simulator. It plays best with 6 players so please let me know if you are interested. (The game is Dune)"
Andrew,@Advanced Memers
Andrew,"Players interested so far: Max, Chris, Devon, maybe Greg"
Andrew,@Rotomotorz Were you interested?
Andrew,maybe but depends on when u plan to play
Andrew,"This evening, I suppose around 8:00 since that is when devon gets back"
Andrew,I never said that
Andrew,Where’s your proof
Andrew,Please don't be difficult
Andrew,I had that as an option so I could remove anyone who didn’t vote within the right demographic
Andrew,Because I put it on a subreddit
Andrew,Ty for taking my survey tho :)))
Andrew,Dune sounds dumb
Andrew,But any of you boys heard of zune?
Andrew,Them boys play music
Andrew,"Bruh a customer spent like $300 in the store and was like “I gotta stop spending so much money, I guess this is better than spending it on mafia city” and I was like “the phone app?” And this mf says “yeah I’ve sunk like $3000 into it with nothing to show for it”"
Andrew,BRO
Andrew,What
Andrew,Why
Andrew,No fucking clue

Andrew,so yell at @Zain to do it
Andrew,"I mean I can do it, but wouldn't it be better to have the server hosted by someone who lives closer to everyone cuz I'm not that close relative to a lot of people in the server"
Andrew,Sounds just like someone who doesn't want to set up the server
Andrew,We should probably pick a modpack first though
Andrew,Do we want a more vanilla friendly pack? An rpg-esque pack? A tech heavy pack?
Andrew,I mean I'll set it up doesn't matter to me and tech heavy in my opinion

Eventually realized that I'm arguing that the author is trying to show that a major component of good is to seek knowledge beyond that which is directly handed to you, and reaching that conclusion required me to put down the story he wrote and go read Plato to understand those four sentences.

But what finally got him the ban was unapolagetically using 'faggot' and 'gay'. This went over poorly with our TOs, who are:

Andrew,@Max they probably do not care
Andrew,This was one of the classes 3 major assignments and not meeting the visual aid requirement is an instant F. If they care so little they would just fail a major assignment why would they even be there.

It features such things as a globally known person on the good side who cannot be killed and leads the investigation, the possibility to kill for the bad guys with risk involved for doing so, and an interesting bluffing dynamic of ""confinement without execution""."

Andrew,The 1 coin goes on the 6 coin
Andrew,@Mr. Airplane
Andrew,Devon has 1 extra coin
Andrew,@Eric Working From Home
Andrew,I would be mad about that takeback
Andrew,Sorry Devon
Andrew,Did Devon do anything?
Andrew,I think you skipped his turn?

Andrew,like
Andrew,68 points
Andrew,Took care of Chris's income
Andrew,Don't forget your 5 points
Andrew,@The Rona Don't forget you can burn power
Andrew,If you need stuff
Andrew,Place on brown unless you need 2 towns there
Andrew,Digging for 3 workers is a terrible idea
Andrew,burn power
Andrew,You could use double dig power action and build on both reds
Andrew,@The Rona
Andrew,actually you need to build a dwelling on the empty space first
Andrew,so they are both in range
Andrew,yeah
Andrew,Now just try and get coins
Andrew,I did it
Andrew,For you
Andrew,It moved from bowl 1
Andrew,Did you tell him you can turn workers to money?
Andrew,You should highly consider the 6 coin bonus
Andrew,Yeah I think so
Andrew,Do you want me to get your income Chris?
Andrew,2 power
Andrew,"Now you can easily prep at least 1 town for the town bonus round, maybe even 2."
Andrew,This is a bad impression of the game for Chris @Mr. Airplane
Andrew,sure
Andrew,Chris and I were making such a great plan
Andrew,rip game

Andrew,this game is such a blast
Andrew,no smile
Andrew,this lookin mega weeb tbh
Andrew,a wee bit
Andrew,it's sooooo fuuuuun thooooo
Andrew,What do you use as a controller for this?
Andrew,"I'm using my stick, but it's pretty straightforward so I'd assume just about any controller or keyboard would work"
Andrew,"it's 8-directional movement, 4 attacks, and one 'move slower so you can be more precise' button"
Andrew,so just about any modern or modern-ish controller should be fine
Andrew,I might get it later today
Andrew,I've been bored
Andrew,Though I wouldn't be able to talk while playing
Andrew,"aight, lemme know if you want to play at some point (the multiplayer is way better than the single player imo)"

Andrew,Gyazo
Andrew,this some bullshit
Andrew,What blizzard game do you even play?
Andrew,cod
Andrew,what do you guys think of these character designs?
Andrew,One thing you might want to consider is that the girl's shirt looks like an Easter egg pattern. Whether or not you want that is up to you.
Andrew,very saturated and clashing colors
Andrew,Easter Egg pattern?
Andrew,oh yeah it does lol
Andrew,
Andrew,it looks like a typical design you'd find on an easter egg
Andrew,kinda like this
Andrew,oh Shirt! I thought you said Skirt.
Andrew,"but yeah, that's what the original shirt looked like, so I went with it"
Andrew,but i think the dark blue on gray is no bueno
Andrew,Original?
Andrew,the values are way too similar you can hardly see the design
Andrew,allow me to explain
Andrew,I build my character designs by using bits and pieces from other designs...
Andrew,this is where I got the shirt and jacket
Andrew,Those colours work better
Andrew,I agree ^
Andrew,better contrast
Andrew,thats what im sayin
Andrew,so maybe change the color of the vest?
Andrew,No
Andrew,The actual shirt itself
Andrew,the shirt or the design
Andrew,on the shirt
Andrew,make it contrast
Andrew,really? I think the black and blue go well together
Andrew,either the pattern colour or the base shirt colour
Andrew,they're way too similar
Andrew,the design fades into the shirt
Andrew,hmm alright
Andrew,but i would also recommend toning down the vest as it is much to bright and saturated
Andrew,also the male character's hair is wayyyyy too blue and bright as well
Andrew,he looks like Sonic
Andrew,how about a white shirt instead of black?
Andrew,also the whole thing is a bit generic
Andrew,yeah that seems better
Andrew,
Andrew,yes better
Andrew,maybe now you should change the socks too
Andrew,maybe now she needs white socks
Andrew,"and I agree. The guy looks a little too monotone. I want the blue hair, so what other colors should be changed"
Andrew,yeah I'd say white socks + black on the shoes
Andrew,but i dont think the blue hair would work with anything
Andrew,it doesn't suit the art style
Andrew,well maybe idk
Andrew,"something else to keep in mind....... these aren't ""natural"" designs either. Like no one could have a ponytail that long and think (don't take that out of context)"
Andrew,omg
Andrew,i know this bro
Andrew,i make really unrealistic designs of blue dogs
Andrew,but there still are principals of character design
Andrew,"I'm aware. Like I said, I think the guy looks a little monotone, so I feel like some colors should be changed"
Andrew,probably the bandada
Andrew,"other than his hair, because I want to keep the blue hair"
Andrew,bandana
Andrew,i didnt even see it at first since it matched the shirt color
Andrew,"hmm, ok. Or I could change his shirt."
Andrew,true
Andrew,but if you change the shirt make sure it doesnt clash with the vest or pants
Andrew,"but I feel like something other than black. Because then he'd look a little too ""dark"""
Andrew,well he's got blue jeans. Almost anything goes with blue jeans
Andrew,i also think the shoes look a tad out of place since there is not brown anywhere else
Andrew,maybe you could make something else brown
Andrew,this is where I got the body for his design.
Andrew,wow you barely changed a thing
Andrew,he also looks very generic
Andrew,like all harem protagonists
Andrew,yeah and thats not good
Andrew,give him a mohawk
Andrew,are you making a harem?
Andrew,Not with this guy
Andrew,i think the outfit is just kinda plain
Andrew,needs something else
Andrew,"Well I gave him a scarf, so I thought that added something"
Andrew,yeah but idk I personally dont like his vest thingy
Andrew,but thats just me
Andrew,anyone else?
Andrew,I think you're a weeb
Andrew,are you an artist at all?
Andrew,or are you just making designs to get other people to draw them
Andrew,No. Hence why I use other design pieces to make mine
Andrew,hmm
Andrew,I can't even draw lines without screwing them up
Andrew,well thats because you probably havent really practiced
Andrew,that's how bad an artist I am
Andrew,bruh
Andrew,everyone starts off bad
Andrew,you're bad for AT LEAST a solid year
Andrew,usually way longer
Andrew,did it also come across to you I don't feel like becoming an artist. I'd rather not spend a year practicing a skill I'll never use
Andrew,fair ig
Andrew,you didnt say that at all tho
Andrew,"but i mean,, art isnt really a skill you never use if you, yknow, draw"
Andrew,Eh
Andrew,i find a lot of fulfillment in drawing for the sake of drawing but i know not everyone's like that
Andrew,but its not a pointless skill
Andrew,Did I ever show you guys my commissions I had done?
Andrew,you showed us one
Andrew,fair
Andrew,lol what kind of response is that
Andrew,well there's just one more I plan to get done when his next session opens up
Andrew,oh so you've only had one done so far
Andrew,I've actually had 2
Andrew,1 character done twice
Andrew,i thought one of them was a group photo
Andrew,"there's the group photo, but there's also the single one, which I had done first"
Andrew,this one was more a test
Andrew,aaa thats pretty cute
Andrew,I do really like this one.
Andrew,same shirt design as your new character tho
Andrew,this character I mean
Andrew,because I use the same one lol
Andrew,huh?
Andrew,"I wanted to give her a short sleeved shirt with a vest, and that was the best I could find"
Andrew,"tbf, her design was made long before the one I just showed you"
Andrew,yeah but that doesn't mean you should give your other characters the same clothes lol
Andrew,"eh, whether I give these guys full life or not is still in the air. I just made them to kill some time"
Andrew,fair ig
Andrew,use that creativity tho bro
Andrew,this is the girl I plan to get commissioned next.
Andrew,who is probably my favorite character of them all
Andrew,:o cute
Andrew,"A lot of my fans of the fanfiction I write also like her. In fact, in a poll I did on my server, she ranked the highest out of all the others"
Andrew,how many people you got in that server? :0
Andrew,You have a big enough fan base to have a discord server?
Andrew,wow
Andrew,"let me check the action number, cause I can't remember"
Andrew,"Well I've got 34 on the server, but not all of my fans are on my server"
Andrew,if I look at my ff.net account (which is where I post the fanfic)
Andrew,"the story has 26 followers, so add that to the 34 on my server"
Andrew,wow
Andrew,Wow the vanguard wiki even has a page for your alternate universe
Andrew,WHAT
Andrew,ARE YOU FR
Andrew,how'd you find that out???
Andrew,google
Andrew,please send me link
Andrew,"plus there are the ones who don't follow the story or on my server, but I know they're reading it."
Andrew,Those I can't count
Andrew,did you add that page yourself
Andrew,"if it's on the fanon wiki, than yes, I added it myself"
Andrew,https://cardfightvanguardfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cardfight!!_Vanguard_X
Andrew,Cardfight!! Vanguard X
Andrew,Cardfight!! Vanguard X is a fan fiction series made by mrd256. It acts as a sequel to G that takes place 20 years later.
Andrew,there's a link to the fanfic on this page
Andrew,"just a fair warning, the fanfic might contain a few missing words here and there, and a few grammar mistakes, but I'm trying to get better"
Andrew,well idk anything about the original story so
Andrew,you actually really don't need to understand the original story to get this.
Andrew,"since it takes place in the future and has it's own story.

also, if they recall back the events in the canon, then I throw in a short summery of what happened"
Andrew,"for example, in one of the most recent chapters, two canon characters, who are friends with the heroine's father, explain how they became friends with him, which are actual events that happened in the original show."
Andrew,"still, i think its odd to read fanfiction if you've never watched/read/whatever the source. I know some people disagree with me though !"
Andrew,"eh, I somewhat agree with you"
Andrew,the story also has over 400 views and 31 reviews
Andrew,What's most valuable lesson you learned while writing this? I plan on writing a book in a few months so some tips would be appreciated.
Andrew,"something is, write every character like they are the protagonist of their own story."
Andrew,"obviously you have you story's main protagonist, but in reality, everyone leads their own life"
Andrew,"So you should reflect that in your stories. Give them personalities that flow with their back stories, and maybe put a little twist on them if you can"
Andrew,My story has 4 maybe 5 point of view characters so I'll definitely need to do this
Andrew,"for example, maybe a character had a tragic back story, but they act all happy and cheerful"
Andrew,maybe use that happy and cheerful personality as way for them to cover up their pain and despair
Andrew,"and when their tragic event is brought up, you (the viewer) sees a different side to them you never thought they had"
Andrew,that can be a key to make 2 or even 3 dimensional characters
Andrew,I've been planning my story for almost a year so I hope it goes well once I start
Andrew,I always think of ideas for stories but this one is my favorite of them all
Andrew,I've never had one develop so fully before
Andrew,"all stories can take time, but sometimes, a good strategy is to release 1 chapter/1 volume at a time. This will make the view anxious or curious as to what's gonna happen next"
Andrew,"also, it gives you time to learn what you did wrong in previous chapters and learn from them to improve future ones"
Andrew,I'm still trying to decide if I should release my story chapter by chapter or wait until the whole thing is done. I'm leaning towards waiting until its done so I can present the best possible product.
Andrew,I'll probably have a small number of test readers who read it live though
Andrew,I kinda like to do both
Andrew,"if I have a story that's fairly short, I'll just release the whole thing at once"
Andrew,"but Vanguard X is a pretty long story, spanning across a total of 4 seasons, and 2 spin off series."
Andrew,"where the story lies right now, I'm entering the last chapter of the first arc of season 1"
Andrew,I've never written a serious project like this so I have no idea how long it will end up being
Andrew,well your first project is always gonna suck. No matter what it is
Andrew,I do know it has three main parts though
Andrew,I hope to avoid that
Andrew,I have done some less serious projects to practice
Andrew,I didn't mean to discourage you
Andrew,"For me personally, I try to keep a positive mindset."
Andrew,I think it leads to the best results.
Andrew,That is true
Andrew,and that's something I envy about you.
Andrew,"lately, I've had a hard time staying positive with all the crap that's been going on in my life"
Andrew,Good luck getting though it
Andrew,It's actually gotten to the point where I need to see a therapist
Andrew,I've already got an appointment scheduled next week
Andrew,I've never been to therapy so I don't know much about it but I hope it helps
Andrew,me too
Andrew,"well it's about time for me to hit the hay. I have work tomorrow, so I'm gonna try and get some sleep"
Andrew,good night

Andrew,This is my opportunity
Andrew,wait what?? how are we supposed to make them
Andrew,Don't ask others
Andrew,ok
Andrew,
Andrew,450 is a lot
Andrew,I dont care how you make them
Andrew,You just need to draw in a single color over the vessels
Andrew,and another color over the brain reigons (blue)
Andrew,you need 450 of the first image you sent?
Andrew,you can probably just use photoshop filters
Andrew,I have to create all this fucking training data so I can make a computer automatically do it
Andrew,Wait
Andrew,You want me to recreate the same image
Andrew,with different colours?
Andrew,you are basically just creating a label that says
Andrew,HEY
Andrew,these pixels are blood vessles
Andrew,Ok wait hol up
Andrew,and these other pixels are NOT blood vessels
Andrew,okay send me the files
Andrew,it just has to be too colors
Andrew,wait i wanna do some too
Andrew,uploading them to g drive rn
Andrew,its going to take all night
Andrew,because I was a fucking retard with the way I extracted these
Andrew,and I don't want to redo it lol
Andrew,"they don't all have to be done by the same person, right?"
Andrew,ehhh honestly it would be best if the same person did it because I am willing to bet there are variations in the way different people would label these images
Andrew,so anyone who is interested can fight amongst the other people who want the job
Andrew,Ill let the free market work in my favor here 
Andrew,I NEED IT
Andrew,DIBS
Andrew,
Andrew,I just need my labelled images ASAP and as cheap as possible

Andrew,That you just need in different colours?

Andrew,Oh wait
Andrew,a
Andrew,minute
Andrew,I get it
Andrew,Actually small append
Andrew,BLACK for vessels
Andrew,WHITE for brain reigons
Andrew,and yes I am willing to have a race

Andrew,wait how is that a race then
Andrew,wtf
Andrew,whoever gets halfway through first has to do the rest?
Andrew,what ab out me
Andrew,whoever reaches the halfway point first
Andrew,okay chris starts at the top
Andrew,dober starts at the 1 /3
Andrew,OKAY FUCK THIS
Andrew,that seems like a waste of time tho for whoever doesnt win
Andrew,Just fight amongst yourselves and decide who gets the job

Andrew,bruh
Andrew,needs more JPG
Andrew,smh bad business man just abandoning things
Andrew,Wrong
Andrew,I am going to let the market work in my favor while sleeping

Andrew,  Food for thought  ?

Andrew,especially cause someone I know and usually beat is seeded 14th (he actually enters these so they know how to place him) so I have a chance to make some upsets

Andrew,we also somehow had 90 ping

Andrew,"There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.
All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.
IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.
IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.
Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.
Cognitive ability is substantially heritable, apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent."

Andrew,they're all
Andrew,locked behind fucking paywalls
Andrew,what the fuck is this bullshit
Andrew,have u tried sci-hub
Andrew,I might have to
Andrew,but mostly I just want to highlight the sheer incompetence of this professor
Andrew,"like, maybe he has memberships to all these random ass journals on software development"
Andrew,but his students sure as hell don't
Andrew,also our summary/review thing has to be 2 pages and the only one of these papers I've found that isn't pay-to-read is only two pages including pictures
Andrew,the summary would have to be longer than the original
Andrew,shoot me
Andrew,haha good luck with that

Andrew,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence.
Andrew,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence. Then by continually bouncing off the slippers and the bed we can generate enough momentum to clip through the floor and skip the window sequence.

Andrew,i'm probably gonna stream it
Andrew,?
Andrew,@everyone games cs ow ?
Andrew,@here
Andrew,games
Andrew,SURE
Andrew,i guess thats a no from everone else lol
Andrew,So I just thought of an interesting challenge.
Andrew,"I call it the ""Bottom Tier Challenge""

You take the lowest tiered character in some kind of competitive fighting game (like Smash), and you keep doing random join ups with random people, until you get a legitimate victory using that character.

here's what counts as a legitimate victory. You have to win via the conditions set in the rules. You cannot win via a timeout, or your opponent disconnects.

You stop play at all before you get a legit win, you fail the challenge."
Andrew,very neat idea
Andrew,Have you won this challenge in any games?
Andrew,I have not.
Andrew,Also @Max you were up pretty early this morning
Andrew,mha finale p good

Andrew,no
Andrew,dont get it
Andrew,alright tuning into 5 streams rn
Andrew,is it any more effective to have multiple streams open?
Andrew,idk if this works but in theory you could open a stream and mute it so your twitch default opens streams muted them jsut go to the valorant directory and middle click each stream to open them all then ctrl+tab through them all so they are all marked as open then just minimize hte window
Andrew,cause you dont have to actually have hte stream unmuted on an active window to recieve drops
Andrew,@Cs:go

Andrew,oh also you missed that one game where Kameron went like 32-6
Andrew,he was going pretty ham last night
Andrew,i can't account for games that i have not played in

- Greg || Jed
- Ben
- Ben ^2
- Smithy

Andrew,oh boy apparently the Valorant anti-cheat has root-level access to your computer 24/7
Andrew,we have all handed riot our entire computers
Andrew,@The Rona I forgot to add zain and since you were last you are out 
Andrew,Sounds like Zain's problem
Andrew,‍♂️
Andrew,Nah dude
Andrew,"so yeah even if they weren't already, China now owns your entire computer"
Andrew,uh
Andrew,"""Ring-0 is essentially the lowest level something can run in.

Running in this permission level essentially means that a given driver has full administrative access to your operating system before it even throws a login screen. It can monitor the boot process, check every driver and device that loads at boot (at least after it's loaded), and can run arbitrary code without any input or knowledge from the user.

It doesn't matter whether you're logged in or not, or whether you've even played the game recently. It is ALWAYS running."""
Andrew,and uninstalling Valorant won't uninstall the monitoring
Andrew,so we have to reinstall windows?
Andrew,wait i'm not sure that's true
Andrew,you can uninstall it manually but it's a separate thing
Andrew,and significantly more complicated
Andrew,I saw someone talking about this in a stream too
Andrew,It is true
Andrew,wtf
Andrew,Wait so am I not in the 10 man
Andrew,Rip
Andrew,and posts about this stuff is getting banned on r/valorant
Andrew,Also people were reporting performance loss in other games due to this
Andrew,so what do I need to delete?
Andrew,whoops
Andrew,@Matt I forgot about max too
Andrew,Max has your spot sorry buddy
Andrew,Whew
Andrew,Accept the Chinese Communist Party into your heart
Andrew,
Andrew,this is riots response to it
Andrew,yeah what do I delete
Andrew,Why did you delete that
Andrew,"If you delete it, then you can't play the game"
Andrew,"there's some control panel level stuff, here's the thread I'm seeing: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/g0gdug/riots_trusted_valorant_mods_deleted_a_thread/"
Andrew,r/pcgaming - Riot's 'Trusted' /Valorant mods deleted a thread about...
Andrew,"9,084 votes and 1,544 comments so far on Reddit"
Andrew,
Andrew,but then yeah you can't play the game
Andrew,"TL;DR Yes we run a driver at system startup, it doesn't scan anything (unless the game is running), it's designed to take up as few system resources as possible and it doesn't communicate to our servers. You can remove it at anytime.

Vanguard contains a driver component called vgk.sys (similar to other anti-cheat systems), it's the reason why a reboot is required after installing. Vanguard doesn't consider the computer trusted unless the Vanguard driver is loaded at system startup (this part is less common for anti-cheat systems).

This is good for stopping cheaters because a common way to bypass anti-cheat systems is to load cheats before the anti-cheat system starts and either modify system components to contain the cheat or to have the cheat tamper with the anti-cheat system as it loads. Running the driver at system startup time makes this significantly more difficult.

We've tried to be very careful with the security of the driver. We've had multiple external security research teams review it for flaws (we don't want to accidentally decrease the security of the computer like other anti-cheat drivers have done in the past). We're also following a least-privilege approach to the driver where the driver component does as little as possible preferring to let the non-driver component do the majority of work (also the non-driver component doesn't run unless the game is running)."
Andrew,I'd rather not play the game then have my data mined
Andrew,"The Vanguard driver does not collect or send any information about your computer back to us. Any cheat detection scans will be run by the non-driver component only when the game is running.

The Vanguard driver can be uninstalled at any time (it'll be ""Riot Vanguard"" in Add/Remove programs) and the driver component does not collect any information from your computer or communicate over the network at all.

We think this is an important tool in our fight against cheaters but the important part is that we're here so that players can have a good experience with Valorant and if our security tools do more harm than good we will remove them (and try something else). For now we think a run-at-boot time driver is the right choice."
Andrew,thats the riot response
Andrew,Lets review the fax
Andrew,bullshit
Andrew,literally no one else does this and it's functionally malware
Andrew,riot is conviniently owned by 10cent
Andrew,they can run anything they want on your computer with this
Andrew,it's also not stopping hackers
Andrew,"and even assuming there's no malicious intent, the second this gets cracked fuckin anyone who wants gets root level access to your computer and can do malicious things with it"
Andrew,antivirus software does this
Andrew,yes but our antivirus software isn't owned by a company owned by China
Andrew,a country famous for not invading privacy for malicious purposes
Andrew,"also, people are already beating the anticheat"
Andrew,so it's not insane to assume someone has or will soon beat the security and boom we're all even more compromised
Andrew,apparently this is an article response to it https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/dev-null-anti-cheat-kernel-driver/
Andrew,/dev/null: Anti-Cheat Kernel Driver - League of Legends
Andrew,We’re protecting some of Riot’s upcoming games with new anti-cheat systems.
Andrew,yeh I still don't really trust it
Andrew,"because no matter what it's still extremely sketchy to need that level of access, especially if it's not working"
Andrew,yeah if we are going this tin foil hat then there is literally nothing any one could say
Andrew,yup
Andrew,but there's plenty of good reasons to tinfoil hat on this one
Andrew,Yeah literally
Andrew,namely the censorship of r/valorant
Andrew,"on the other hand, there's no real reason to panic cause odds are your computer's already hella compromised"
Andrew,fusion doesnt use a vpn when he torrents all of those games so i doubt hes scared of anyone
Andrew,ok if we are worried about the big bad tencent and china then we must be worried about all of these companies as well right https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/
Andrew,Every game company that Tencent has invested in
Andrew,A quick reference of how China's largest tech conglomerate has quietly expanded into videogames.
Andrew,@Jed
Andrew,have my spot
Andrew,@Zain
Andrew,"yes, yes I am Zain"
Andrew,but none of them have installed root-level permission software on my computer
Andrew,Zack you can get so much information off of discord but why do you still use this application when Tencent has invested in it as well
Andrew,"like, on one hand, I'm still gonna play Valorant because I assume everything I do is already tracked by at least someone sketchy because realistically you can't avoid it, but on the other hand, I think people should understand what's going on

also are you insane in comparing what they can get out of discord vs. always on root access"
Andrew,if we are worried about selling our information or compromising or security this would priority number one no?
Andrew,"discord can't run any code it wants with any level of permission on my computer without me knowing about it
discord can't see every single thing I do on my computer
discord can't look at every single file on my computer at all times"
Andrew,"discord can see what I put into discord: messages, voice, occasionally video, what game I'm playing, and the files I post"
Andrew,ok sure

Andrew,"Copied from another server: PLEASE do not play TF2 or ANY source games in the meantime. A serious leak of source code has been reportedly leaked into the public. If true, it means source games are easily compromised and you should not play them at the moment.What this means is cheaters could potentially install programs or get information from your PC through source games if true.(Allegedly) the developer of cathook has discovered a way to RCE (remote code execute) on TF2 just by you being in the server. This allows anyone who does this to run any code on your computer, including viruses, turning your game into an aimbot, or deleting your items. Playing any source game, including TF2 is dangerous right now, and we suggest not playing until there is some kind of fix for this."

Andrew,
Andrew,This is not what he is referring to
Andrew,We played a game in class months ago where we stood in a circle and played some adding game

Andrew,wtf is this class it sounds really retarded
Andrew,It's public speaking
Andrew,Not like you could figure that out from the test questions though lol
Andrew,owch
Andrew,You know something's up when you don't know even remotely what class someone is by looking at test questions
Andrew,This is the least relevant test I've ever seen
Andrew,Most of the questions are normal but like 20% are garbage like above
Andrew,"I don't know if what I said sounded insulting, but believe me, I'm only insulting the test."
Andrew,
Andrew,ikd max but that sounds like an insult
Andrew,I wrote it poorly
Andrew,I was trashing the test
Andrew,not you
Andrew,if i had to take a guess i'd say its some type of philisophical course but like
Andrew,lol
Andrew,"Sorry Benson, I only realized it could sound like an insult towards you like 30 seconds after sending it"
Andrew,Definitely was not my intention
Andrew,non taken. just poking fun at your wording choice
