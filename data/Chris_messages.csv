Chris,"Ok so all this server is a hub for friends to play games, chat, hangout, and genrally have fun. This server is ment to be a replacement for the orginal frostbite server that has become very large and unwieldy. The orginal frostbite server has also become very inactive and stagnate as a result of its size. That is why am hopeing to keep this community relatively small so that we can be active and have fun."

Chris,cause the other company got bought out

Chris,your parents blocked youtube?
Chris,yea
Chris,what
Chris,why
Chris,my parents have a router extension thing that has customisable filters
Chris,cause they don't trust me apperently
Chris,they were so caught up in what they could do that they didn't stop to think about whether or not they SHOULD
Chris,also what do they think you're doing on youtube? watching porn?
Chris,yup
Chris,I'm like 95% sure that's not something you can do
Chris,I'm gonna assume that youtube filters that kind of thing
Chris,also do they not realize there are much better sources of that kind of thing?
Chris,"besides, something I've learned from pranking friends on school computers is that it's impossible to block ALL of the porn"

Chris,oh I know that
Chris,oh
Chris,I don't get their reasoning

Chris,I did
Chris,its the chronological order all the marvel movies take place in timeline wise
Chris,How was this timeline created?
Chris,people with alot of time on their hands
Chris,i mean it makes sense
Chris,starts with first captain america and ends with guardians of the galaxy
Chris,What the hell is Cloak & Dagger?
Chris,unreleased stuff
Chris,clock can travel into different dimensions and dagger kills people
Chris,its a little tv series that hasnt come out yet
Chris,"""clock"""
Chris,cloak*
Chris,lol
Chris,I wasn't doubting the validness(?) of the timeline
Chris,I was just wondering how they determined it
Chris,Because I am interested in that stuff
Chris,for the released stuff its kinda obvious
Chris,since they use specific dates in the actual movies
Chris,so you can jsut be like oh yeah
Chris,there it is
Chris,and for the unreleased stuff i think its jsut Theory Crafting
Chris,okay so the list of currently Released Movies we need to watch in Order is...
Chris,"Captain America 1

Chris,I gotta go to work but legit think about it maybe over march break @The Rona
Chris,not all in one day obv
Chris,I'm down
Chris,yo lit
Chris,ill try and figure out which ones are on netflix and which ones ill need to pirate
Chris,bad
Chris,???
Chris,Pirating things is wrong
Chris,it is stealing
Chris,and if everyone did it no more movies would be made
Chris,just think about that
Chris,http://puu.sh/ujKXT/d8381d16a8.jpg
Chris,and by pirating something when not everyone else does it is like saying you are better than them
Chris,most things you dont even need to pirate
Chris,you know photoshop?
Chris,and other adobe products
Chris,i have the files from adobe im using their files
Chris,not third party
Chris,i just know how to mess with the security on it and make my free trial go from lasting 7 days to 1000 days
Chris,that is stealing and wrong
Chris,no third party programs or software adobe jsut has really loose security for being such a large company
Chris,thats on them
Chris,if a store had no alarm system and just a bad lock would it be okay to steal from that store?
Chris,no becuase that is stealing not pirating
Chris,PIRACY IS STEALING
Chris,there is no a finite amount of computer programs or files
Chris,there is a finite amount of objects
Chris,but you still obtain something without payment to the creator
Chris,"Piracy is a Victimless Crime, Stealing is not."
Chris,NO
Chris,if you made something and everyone pirated it you would be very upset becasue you would make 0 MONEY
Chris,"if its a small startup or something like and indie game/film from a small company i will pay for their products and support them if i think its worth my money, but if its a large company like Adobe or Marvel where my 1 Aquisition without payment will not affect them then i feel no shame in doing what i do"
Chris,how can you even defend yourself? you know its illegal and wrong yet you try to come up with reasons why it is okay even though you know you wouldn't like it if someone pirated something you made
Chris,Big companies deserve money for their work just as much as small ones
Chris,im not trying to defend myself
Chris,am i doing something illegal? yes.
Chris,do i feel remorse? no.
Chris,Piracy is Comparable to Jaywalking
Chris,yeah its illegal but nobody cares
Chris,that is so untrue
Chris,@The Rona I mgiht be Busy March 11-15 but im free the other days of march break i believe
Chris,@here games bois?
Chris,maybe
Chris,i'm kinda enjoying my pokemon and chill session ive got going on tho
Chris,you should join me and chris for a pokemans nuzlocke challenge at some point
Chris,Yo boyd
Chris,In a work meeting
Chris,I'm literally never not pirating something
Chris,@SWIRL GIRL It's ok I support your pirating 110%
Chris,thanks fam
Chris,np
Chris,"to put my two cents in about pirating, yeah it's illegal, yeah it's morally wrong, but it's prevelant enough that most companies work it into their assumptions about how much money they can make and at that point it's become so standard that it almost doesn't matter"
Chris,but personally
Chris,Sylki join so we can play my game when doctor comes back
Chris,"I only pirate stuff like books I can get from the library but am too lazy to walk to, old games that I'd be getting second hand so the original creators don't make any money anyway, or software that I already own but it's on my old computer and a massive pain to transfer"
Chris,doc is back btw
Chris,and textbooks cause they're crazy overpriced and there's no way to know if you're actually gonna need them till like 1/3 of the way through the course
Chris,also I'm busy and I'm not gonna be able to play tonight
Chris,okay
Chris,also how do you even pirate a textbook?
Chris,@The Rona Older misha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tSZEMc1CVk

Chris,Have you heard of M.C. Escher before Quick?
Chris,He's the artist of that picture
Chris,He has a whole bunch of stuff like that that breaks perspective and positioning and it's super neat
Chris,I've only ever heard of him as the person who drew this picture
Chris,I had never heard of him before now
Chris,His stuff is pretty cool
Chris,honestly he's one of my favourite artists
Chris,he fiddles with the ways you have to draw to give the illusion of a third dimension in order to make trippy geometrically impossible pictures and they're always super interesting
Chris,"so I'm studying for a test tomorrow, and the prof posts old tests, and when I was talking to one of my friends who took the course last year, they said this test was basically impossible and everyone did horribly, and I kinda throught they were exaggerating"

Chris,WHOOOOOOOO
Chris,Whooooo
Chris,Orisa
Chris,?
Chris,Go-to play overwatch
Chris,"What is this, a discord for owls?"
Chris,On YouTube
Chris,Send links
Chris,wow the alt fire sounds super OP
Chris,Yeah it does
Chris,She look really good
Chris,Also Bastion is getting a small nerf
Chris,"Instead of 35% damage resistance, they are lowering it to 20%"
Chris,Why do they gotta release the new hero when I have a test tomorrow ;-;
Chris,I don't think its for a while yet
Chris,Is just on ptr thou
Chris,She's on the PTR
Chris,The new hero sounds pretty bad
Chris,How so?
Chris,Her weapon slows her while firing
Chris,Also abilities just sound kinda useless in general
Chris,Non moving shields aren't that useful
Chris,Because people move a lot in overwatch
Chris,Fortify just sounds really dumb
Chris,If you slow down whole shooting
Chris,*while
Chris,Thoughts? @The Rona
Chris,How you gonna sit there and do my ass like that
Chris,I don't think the slowing while firing matters too too much
Chris,Especially since we don't know her damage right now
Chris,Depending on the shield cool-down the non moving might not be a problem
Chris,"The alt-fire seems pretty good, mini grav + hook, and it slows you"
Chris,I have more too add but I am in chem right now
Chris,I think that her abilities are counterproductive
Chris,Shut up
Chris,@Mr. Airplane The alt fire can be used to pull people off of high ground
Chris,also dva slows down when she shoots and she's pretty good
Chris,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Chris,900
Chris,Anybody know how much health the shield has?
Chris,900
Chris,"So, her gun it pretty good"
Chris,it's a bit weird tho
Chris,looks like it should be hitscan
Chris,isn't hitscan
Chris,"Yeah, it's projectiles"
Chris,seems strong tho
Chris,"she could be good, we'll have to see"
Chris,i like the gravity thing she has
Chris,welp I was just on a team with a 76 and a mccree who couldn't kill their idiot pharah

Chris,new hero?
Chris,yee boy
Chris,seems pretty cool. I could see playing her with mercy on defense instead of ana
Chris,I'm pretty sure the damage boost from her ult doesn't stack with Mercy's
Chris,that would make since
Chris,I have a feeling she's going to be the go to second tank in a bastion meta
Chris,esspecially on defense
Chris,"I can see her + rein being really infuriating to deal with, cause you're got two decently sized shields with the whole team hiding behind them, if you get too close you have to deal with the rein hammer and if you stay far out you have to deal with her machine gun mowing people down"
Chris,does her grav thing pull through shields?
Chris,it goes through shields
Chris,I don't think her gun has falloff damage
Chris,"nah I mean if you detonate it in front of a shield, will it pull the people behind it?"
Chris,it does for sure
Chris,starts at like 25-30 meters
Chris,wait
Chris,maybe not
Chris,I think it might pull through shields
Chris,I'm pretty sure there is no falloff
Chris,It's just her spread
Chris,spread gets crazy there though
Chris,making you hit less
Chris,I could see people getting crazy environmental kills with her grav though
Chris,like indoor nepal
Chris,I wonder if it pulls through walls
Chris,like Zarya's graviton
Chris,I dont think so
Chris,it looks like it needs los
Chris,You could use it on that wall on Lijang
Chris,If it doesn't need los
Chris,you wouldn't need the wall just shoot it off the stage and detonate it
Chris,true
Chris,Also I don't know if you guys know this but when she uses her fortify ability she gets a 50% damage resistance (I think)
Chris,but that makes me think that it shouldn't be able to pull through shields

Chris,new sm4sh tier list!
Chris,ROB dropped 13 places
Chris,rip
Chris,gg ROB
Chris,wait actually only 5
Chris,was looking at the wrong old tier list
Chris,Good mistake
Chris,still he's now in the bottom half of the list
Chris,why is sonic 5th
Chris,there's like one player who does ok with sonic ever and he's actually a cloud main
Chris,only 1.5 people do well with falco in melee and he is second
Chris,1.5?
Chris,mango is .5
Chris,westballz is 1
Chris,I see
Chris,and even westballz uses fox for certain matchups
Chris,so maybe 1.2?
Chris,"TIL Samuel L Jackson likes anime

Chris,Samuel L. Jackson Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions | WI...
Chris,"yes, but there's a lot of decent falco players or players with decent falcos"
Chris,you look at the top 50 or so players and there are a lot of falcos
Chris,Isn't ppmd a good falco?
Chris,"you look at sm4sh top 50, first sign of a sonic is at 12th, and the guy barely plays sonic anymore, instead focusing on cloud, and even then he doesn't have particularly good results"
Chris,He's a Marth main yeah
Chris,and the other 3 sonics in the top 50 never make top 8
Chris,rarely make top 16
Chris,"and yet he's over 4 characters who have won majors (mario, mewtwo, marth, zss)"
Chris,also somehow bayo snuck out on top
Chris,she's definately high/top tier but not the best in the game
Chris,don't think bayo's ever done better than 4th or 5th at majors
Chris,yeah her best ever result at a major (even pre-nerf) is 4th and somehow she's considered the best character in the game
Chris,What is the criteria for the tier list  though?
Chris,"it's also funny looking at this tier list in relation to kingston sm4sh, where, based on our current PR (which admittadly has some odd parts), from #1 down through the honourable mentions, we play 28th, 35th, 38th (working on switching to 4th), 36th, 17th, 40th, 7th/43rd (and he's far better at 43rd), 12th, 47th, 23rd/11th, and then honourable mentions play 12th/6th, 6th/37th, and 4th"
Chris,everyone who plays a character in S or A tier (1-12) are all 7th or worse
Chris,Your number 1 player plays DK?
Chris,"I'm pretty sure the list is supposed to be based on how good the character is on paper, which imo is kind of dumb when in some cases there's little to no proof that they're that good in practice, and some characters who suck on paper have pretty good results"
Chris,yeah DKBill
Chris,"DK, Ike, Shulk (trying to get a sheik going), wario, villager, g&w, fox/little mac (way better at little mac, is gonna be climbing back up now that he's switched back), ryu, kirby, captain falcon/zss"
Chris,"not counting the guy working on swtiching to sheik, our only person who plays an s-tier is an honourable mention"

Chris,also you trusted smithy super hard and he was involved in every facist
Chris,Kameron that was so terrible stop this
Chris,you dont usually play this game straightfoward lmao
Chris,Kameron you threw
Chris,Eventually though if you play with enough people your goal is to categorize unknown players with know playstyles so saying you need to anticipate plaing with different people is a weak argument

It is just one bill introduced by disgruntled Republicans who are fighting it out to have a new plan that completely repeals Obamacare."

Chris,Why banished though?
Chris,so I don't get Ava sick
Chris,tell Ava to get bent
Chris,pull rank on her
Chris,you were there first
Chris,wait you are older right?
Chris,Ava and I hold the opinion that the sick person should concede their rights to the well person
Chris,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring
Chris,we have agreed on this in the past
Chris,I must honor my agreement
Chris,fair enough
Chris,Are you one of those older child supremacists?
Chris,are there any non-first-born older child supremacists?
Chris,just out of curiostiy
Chris,why not just not interact?
Chris,Doubtful
Chris,BECAUSE HE COUGHS IN THE AIR AND ITS
Chris,yes there are sylki
Chris,they are called the younger children
Chris,that's like being a black white supremicist
Chris,"Completely off topic, they are reverting the changes to Ana's heal grenade on the PTR"
Chris,boooooooooooooooooooooooo
Chris,And they are also removing the ability for Zen to apply discord orb through barriers
Chris,that kinda makes sense
Chris,nah im not an older child supremecist im actually the youngest in my family
Chris,i just run the house
Chris,then why did you need to mention that he is older?
Chris,cause he should pull rank on you
Chris,but he does not outrank me
Chris,"I made a youtube banner for my friends channel, any feedback or changes i should make before sending it to her?"
Chris,"nah, looks good"
Chris,"make sure the ""art and animation"" part has the same sized margins as the name"
Chris,cause right now they're tighter and it looks a bit odd
Chris,other than that it's lookin good
Chris,yeah thats my b I see it now too
Chris,also might want to make it not italicized
Chris,they were the same sized margins but then I made the aubtext italic so yeah forgot to account for that
Chris,it's up to you but I'm personally a fan of consistancy with this sort of thing so I'd keep it non-italic
Chris,well im using different fonts aswell for the titlw and subtext
Chris,im trying to break them up
Chris,I have no idea how it'd look but you might also want to try the same kind of text border thing you have going for hte main title on the subtitle
Chris,"different fonts works, but I prefer to keep them in a similar theme"
Chris,k thanks for the advice (not sarcasm)
Chris,"cause already you have different size, positioning, and font, adding the italics is just a tad too much imo"
Chris,"shrugs as always tho it's up to you, trust your own aesthetic sense"
Chris,@Sak von Sak skullgrills

Chris,"A student who was born female felt perfectly comfortable identifying as a man at Wellesley College — until people said he shouldn’t be class diversity officer because he is now a white male. Timothy Boatwright was born a girl, and checked off the “female” box when applying to the Massachusetts all-women’s school, according to an article in the New York Times. But when he got there, he introduced himself as a “masculine-of-center genderqueer” person named “Timothy” (the name he picked for himself) and asked ..."

Chris,becuase the only good player on that side of the bracket is the moon
Chris,and shroomed

Chris,cause I've been mostly watching sm4sh cause there's more strong players in the bracket

Chris,I don't know why he isn't
Chris,mango never went mario I'm pretty sure
Chris,prolly matchup familiarity?
Chris,like he's just more comfortable fox vs falcon
Chris,I don't think he's taken games with his sheik today
Chris,yes he has
Chris,"not sure tho, mostly been watching sm4sh"
Chris,he took 1 vs shroomed
Chris,and 1 vs hungry pidgeon
Chris,shrugs no idea then
Chris,whose your bet on the winner?
Chris,hbox of course
Chris,the safe pick
Chris,his only threat is m2k
Chris,no one else has even a small chance of beating him
Chris,hasn't m2k been beating hbox lately?
Chris,last set was summit where he lost
Chris,but prior to that was a local where they traded sets
Chris,could go either way
Chris,no player other than m2k can beat hbox
Chris,of moon and shroomed who do you think would do better if they make WF?
Chris,I think shroomed would have a better chance against both m2k and hbox
Chris,barring something insane (equivilant to that random wizzy over hbox) you're right
Chris,but I'm just gonna sit here and hope for more upsets
Chris,wizzy did it twice actually
Chris,once was vs a broken finger hbox though
Chris,I thought Armada was the best tho
Chris,"I woulnd't be super surprised if there were more upsets, it's been a fairly upset heavy tourney, in both games"

Chris,"Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world. Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves. All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people.

- George Bernard Shaw"
Chris,"Just playing devils advocate, based on his statement, stability and not being an asshole are the sole domain of the reasonable"
Chris,Which makes this a shaky argument for the unreasonable unless he enforced the importance of both
Chris,And you just didn't include the whole quote
Chris,"I think what is meant by this is that the people who ask ""so why isn't that possible"" are the unreasonable people because most people just accept it can't be done"
Chris,that is all of the quote I was given
Chris,if there is more that is my schools fault for not including the rest
Chris,Fair enough
Chris,I took it as a quote encouraging innovation and asking questions
Chris,which is something I appreciate
Chris,Based on the adapt to the world/adapt the world phrasing I think my point about the importance of both stands
Chris,I don't believe there is more to the quote
Chris,Adapting the world to you is the same as creating things to make your life easier
Chris,like making AC
Chris,the world is now whatever temperature I want
Chris,boom
Chris,Because if everyone tried to change the world to suit them we'd have a mess if t weren't for those who adapt to maintain it
Chris,world adapted
Chris,that is why most people are born with no sense of doing and are lazy
Chris,almost no one actually cares
Chris,Symbiotic n stuff
Chris,those who adapt to the world are mere followers
Chris,they can never make a difference
Chris,See a lot of you guys are very ambitious and want to have a huge impact with your job
Chris,Whereas all I really want is to get a good blue collar job
Chris,Not some field where I am a pioneer and I have to create and research new things
Chris,to each their own
Chris,"I'm not attacking the ones who make a difference, I'm just saying that both types are needed for those differences to become a part of a stable society"
Chris,You can't lead if everyone is a leader
Chris,true
Chris,I can lead but honestly I'd rather have my job clearly set out for me
Chris,but I believe that people are born in a proportion to what is needed by intelligent design
Chris,I get the work done and go home
Chris,"I'm reminded of a school trip I took back in middle school, at one point we had a motivational speaker talking to us, and he did a little ""repeat after me"" thing, going through stuff like ""I will live my life to its fullest"", ""I won't back down from a challenge"", etc, but then at one point he goes ""I will lead not follow"" and the whole room repeats this, with me and a friend just silently looking at each other and trying not to crack up"
Chris,"Most people are content as or would rather be followers, even if they'd say otherwise if you asked them"
Chris,that is accurate
Chris,see opinion above
Chris,"This was mostly in agreement with that (not a personal believer in intelligent design, but with the rest of it)"
Chris,"Personally, if the person I'm following is doing a better job than I could I'm fine not being in charge but if not Ill usually take charge"
Chris,The only issue with being a follower is making sure you are following the right leadee
Chris,"Which was a bitch for group projects in high school, where in my friend group I was at the top end of the bottom half, in terms of organization/leadership ability, so I'd always get stuck wrangling my super lazy/disorganized friends"
Chris,Sounds like every group project I've been in 
Chris,never done a group project but they sound horrible
Chris,They are
Chris,"Or consider our old tf2 team, where I main called for most of it just because I had more experience than you guys, despite not being a particularly great main caller and much preferring to manage a smaller chunk of the team (as roamer or scout I normally micromanage the flank, or as med usually just the combo) and let someone else handle the main strats"
Chris,us people who actually care get killed by those who are okay with a C
Chris,Any decent teacher groups you with people at your grade level or lets you choose your own groups
Chris,And the rare group projects with a good group are glorious
Chris,It's so dumb cause most teachers at my school assign groups
Chris,"One history project though I got the best group ever, like they were down to work on it outside of school and we ended up getting a 100% on it"
Chris,"Also, as a brief aside, some people who are happy with a C care quite a bit but just aren't equipped to do better (and yes they still drag you down but not for lack of caring)"
Chris,@Sak von Sak I invented a new melee crew battle format
Chris,it involves two teams of 6
Chris,and all the characters
Chris,in some way
Chris,"there's a guy in the kingston sm4sh discord whose current name is ""Darwid, Guac Master"""
Chris,what is that?

Chris,I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IT IS

Chris,that means you are on the road to adulthood
Chris,it's basically just that I ate lunch at 4 and I've been snacking all day so I'm completely not hungry
Chris,and as a result don't have the energy for actual food
Chris,Poor Sylki and his poptarts
Chris,what flavor poptarts though
Chris,asking the real questions
Chris,the pop tarts are great but they are symbolic of my life's slow but inevitable descent into chaos and madness

Chris,"lololololol apparently our premier (the person in charge of provincial-level governemtn, don't know what the US equivilant would be, governer maybe?) only has a 12% approval rating"
Chris,lol what a loser
Chris,Bush had a higher approval rating than that
Chris,"and I don't even know what she did wrong, I've heard of no controversial bills, no scandals, no one expressing a particular dislike, nothing"
Chris,fake news?
Chris,but clearly something has gone horribly wrong
Chris,maybe she isn't disliked that much
Chris,"I'm assuming that yeah, she's not the target of strong dislike, just not many people particularly like her"
Chris,alternatively since it's provincial level I just haven't heard much cause it's smaller scale
Chris,but DAMN 12% approval rating is awful
Chris,What's her name?
Chris,kathleen wynne
Chris,or something like that
Chris,dunno exact spelling

Chris,but nope he's going to a sm4sh tournament
Chris,he just got basically jv3'd by a top 20 player
Chris,he only technically didn't jv3 him cause he took 1 damage from being too far offscreen while killing bizz
Chris,does he play ganon?
Chris,of course he does
Chris,he even tried to uptilt

Chris,edgy long hair swordsmen?
Chris,i'd believe it
Chris,somehow neither of them is edgy in game
Chris,boi dunban is extra edgy
Chris,hello???
Chris,how is he edgy?
Chris,other than that he's metal af
Chris,err sorry not dunban i'm dumb
Chris,the other one is edgy
Chris,I mean I only just met him
Chris,he doesn't seem that edgy
Chris,dunban is not that edgy in fairness
Chris,oh oops no spoiling then
Chris,uh oh
Chris,suddenly very worried
Chris,ts nothing major just he becomes more edgy later on
Chris,aight
Chris,dunban is super metal tho
Chris,at least at the start
Chris,oh yeah totally
Chris,but he becomes less edgy as it goes on
Chris,"man burns out all the nerves in one arm fighting the good fight, waits a year, then comes right back in fighting with the other arm and giving zero fucks"
Chris,man runs straight down a cliff
Chris,yeah and then it turns out he's the mentor character like
Chris,
Chris,yup
Chris,the other dude (lao?) is kinda like the opposite
Chris,@Zain what was network id and passowrd
Chris,starts out chill and develops the badass/edgy-ness?
Chris,yeah basically
Chris,lao's got nuts dps
Chris,also true
Chris,"for a sniper dude who keeps going ""it's not my forte, but..."" every time I go for melee combos he's got some damn good melee arts"
Chris,and that one art that buffs everyone's ranged stuff is so good
Chris,especially when my main character does giant laser beams
Chris,yeah lao is super good at the point where you first get to use him
Chris,its been to fucking long since i played x tho liek actually
Chris,I just got it a few days ago
Chris,thus far loving it
Chris,i played it on release which was like a few years ago i think
Chris,yeah I was hoping the price would go down before I got it
Chris,its a great game tho
Chris,ran out of patience
Chris,oh unlucky
Chris,Lin is such a good character
Chris,shame her design is super uncanny valley and all
Chris,just remember she's 13
Chris,"""13"""
Chris,yeah I know
Chris,I'm not saying she's attractive
Chris,she's just really funny
Chris,no i'm just making fun of the super young tech nerd cliche but she's a well developed character
Chris,and she's also funny which is nice
Chris,there's something just.... off... about her model
Chris,it's super unsettling and I can't put my finger on it
Chris,she has bug eyes curved downward which make her look a little off sometimes
Chris,that might be it
Chris,the characters have fairly normal eyes but lin has really big eyes in comparison
Chris,I mean I gave my character purple and teal cat eyes and it's somehow less unsettling
Chris,(also don't ask how purple and teal work together but somehow they do)
Chris,idk mans
Chris,Still the greatest sin this game has is not allowing us to play as Tatsu
Chris,noooo tatsu's annoying
Chris,never been a fan of the nopon
Chris,we need to successor to the heropon
Chris,didn't really like riki either
Chris,riki was hype
Chris,he's comic relief and occasional emotional crutch for melia and beyond that he serves no purpose
Chris,reyn and riki together made it much better
Chris,and he's not even a good party member
Chris,Wait that's actually not true riki is easily one of the better ones
Chris,really? I never figured out how to make him any good
Chris,he's a magic tank and he's got like half the statuses
Chris,yeah but he can't draw aggro
Chris,so being a tank is useless
Chris,he focuses on statusing
Chris,statuses draw aggro i believe
Chris,moreso than big damage
Chris,I could never get him to hold aggro
Chris,dunno
Chris,its nbd unless you're going for like max difficulty runs or something
Chris,shrugs he never did any work for me
Chris,best party for me was dunban fiora sharla
Chris,mad jukes and on the offchance you get hit sharla's got your back
Chris,yeah
Chris,dunban fiora melia is good for most of the game up until you start hitting frequent enemies with strong AoE that just kills melia without her even having aggro
Chris,i kinda gave up on sharla because overheating is a terrible mechanic
Chris,just never play as sharla and you won't notice
Chris,no i notices because she just doesnt do anything
Chris,and she eventually gets a skill that halves the time it takes
Chris,yeah but by then i could just use melia
Chris,eh she just has less overall healing
Chris,yeah but she's got more than enough damage to make up for it
Chris,and in the late game stuff gets AoE that can one shot her without her having aggro and without getting a vision
Chris,and then once you revive her it takes ages to get heals back up properly
Chris,reyn melia shulk/dunban is  how i went most of the game
Chris,yeah that's true
Chris,how on earth did you run reyn melia? melia never seems to give enough heals to sustain him at all
Chris,if the enemies were being aoe happy i'd just play her and play super conservatively
Chris,also can we talk about how shit melia's AI is?
Chris,absolutely
Chris,its terrible
Chris,"if you've got melia in the party, you play melia"
Chris,also sustaining reyn wasn't that bad
Chris,skyfactoryfb
Chris,what elementals did you use?
Chris,"melia had slow heals but she did work, and whenever i ran shulk we had monado shield and stuff too"
Chris,I mean melia's great for 4/5 of the time she's in the party
Chris,I hoenstly don't even remember its been way too longs since I played chronicles
Chris,actually what i think i did was
Chris,i'd healing gift and then hide int he back with water elemental
Chris,and then just try and pooke with fire and electric
Chris,huh I did basically the same
Chris,but it seemed like healing gift couldn't really keep up
Chris,yeah sometimes reyn would get low so i'd have to burn a water discharge
Chris,it seemed like the main issue was just the cooldown
Chris,shrugs
Chris,melia dunban was nuts tho
Chris,i dont remember the specifics my last full playthrough of chronicles was easily over three years ago
Chris,especially if you did water+lightning+wind and he just gets even more agility
Chris,dunban made me feel guilty using him lmao
Chris,he's so good

Chris,2GGaming Playing Super Smash Bros. for Wii U - Twitch Clips
Chris,2GGC: Civil War - Climax - Clipped by Booyahman
Chris,doesn't show the end of the match but it was just a random bair at like 140
Chris,isn't samus bad?
Chris,yeah
Chris,also doesn't esam play pikachu?
Chris,but pika mario is apparently one of the worst high tier matchups in the game
Chris,"the terrible high tier mus are diddy > ryu, mario > pika, um"
Chris,apparently meta knight > rosa but I have no idea why
Chris,this would be like a hype mango vs armada themed tournament and hbox just wins
Chris,rosa > ness might be the worst matchup in any smash game
Chris,"this would be like, if at G3 mango went out to like abate and armada lost to like.... scar"
Chris,wow that extreme?
Chris,I have never heard of the guy who knocked zero out
Chris,then again he made top 96 so maybe a bit better
Chris,it'd be like if armada lost to trillium
Chris,or homemadewaffles
Chris,that would be super funny
Chris,the quivilant for armada to lose to like melee esam and then trillium
Chris,and then for mango to lose to like mafia and abate
Chris,who was ally's first loss?
Chris,trela
Chris,he's somewhere in the 40s I think
Chris,character?
Chris,ryu
Chris,oh actually he's 25th
Chris,what
Chris,oh it's almost a year outdated
Chris,was looking at the older rankings
Chris,trela's 42nd
Chris,"so if I'm gonna follow exact rankings, mang0 lost to Abu and Dizzkidboogie playing dk"
Chris,"actually going by position in the tier list, dkb's zelda"
Chris,and neither of the people zero lost to are ranked so I dunno how to compare it
Chris,there's also a link guarunteed at least 9th
Chris,that's the equivilant of a DK being guarunteed 9th at the most stacked melee tournament you've ever seen
Chris,this tournament is actually insane

Chris,yeah
Chris,why?
Chris,this falcon player is by far the most fun to watch player I've ever seen in smash 4
Chris,dunno why they're outside
Chris,but yeah fatality's a crowd favourite for a reason
Chris,these are my two favourite players
Chris,I still want nairo to win tho
Chris,also if you missed the end of game two https://clips.twitch.tv/CrypticPreciousWatermelonChocolateRain

Chris,wow 3-0 comeback
Chris,hooooooly shit
Chris,fatality is soooo nuts
Chris,that pop off too
Chris,he's so hyped
Chris,that set was insane
Chris,that might have been the best set I've seen all year
Chris,that was also a really short set
Chris,is smash 4 usually that fast?
Chris,like games end quickly
Chris,nope
Chris,that's basically the peak of aggro play in sm4sh
Chris,if only the whole game was like that
Chris,"fastest players you're likely to see are nairo, fatality, SuperGirlKels (tho she's lower level), esam's pika, larry lurr"
Chris,also marss
Chris,forgot about marss
Chris,what about hax
Chris,sm4sh
Chris,not melee
Chris,only problem with fatality is he's really bad at slowing it down when he needs to
Chris,even if someone's doing a great job walling him out he'll keep bashing his head against it
Chris,@The Rona
Chris,I found the mythical 8
Chris,woah
Chris,"commentators currently discussing whether to call the mewtwo combo abandango invented ""The Aba-combo"" or ""The Combo-dango"""
Chris,aba combo is better
Chris,^
Chris,I'm partial to the combo-dango
Chris,that one kinda sounds inappropriate
Chris,so?
Chris,it's so much more fun to say
Chris,esports needs to be esports
Chris,aba-combo is easier to say
Chris,"various sm4sh combos are commonly called ""The hoo-hah"", ""The ding-dong"", ""The beep-boop"", etc."
Chris,"I agree, and it sounds better"
Chris,aba-combo
Chris,we don't do legit sounding names of things
Chris,"I'm not sure if you guys have heard how abadango is pronounced, but the dango part sounds pretty similar to combo"
Chris,it basically ends up sounding like combo-dongo
Chris,which is why it's easy to replace dango with combo
Chris,shrugs
Chris,still more fun to say
Chris,but I'll agree to disagree
Chris,also I kinda just hate you so you know
Chris,kinda have to disagree
Chris,
Chris,DK IN TOP 8
Chris,another top 10 player out
Chris,7/10 have been eliminated
Chris,"only one in top 8 thus far, two of them are in losers"
Chris,wow
Chris,I was watching the DK set
Chris,DK's duuuuumb
Chris,that MU looks brutal tho
Chris,cause sheik has such a hard time killing
Chris,and DK's so heavy and he's never gonna let her get rage
Chris,I don't think mr r got over 100% that whole set
Chris,if you're still watching witness my least favourite character
Chris,fuck ryu
Chris,why?
Chris,"man has a kill confirm at like 65-90 (rage dependant) off uptilt or downtilt, both of which are somewhere between frame 1-3"
Chris,plus it's safe on shield
Chris,and he's super heavy so he always gets a ton of rage
Chris,he has a fast shield breaker so you can't just shield
Chris,on bigger characters (like ROB) he can nairplane you across the stage into a spike
Chris,he has a cancellable super-armour move
Chris,that is also a free setup into his best kill move (aka you die at like 65 if he's got rage)
Chris,rob even has a decent matchup against ryu (pretty close to 50/50 imo) but he's just such a pain to fight against
Chris,"cause ryu has trouble approaching through projectiles, but he touches you and you're boned"
Chris,nairo why would you go to T&C and give ryu a lower cieling
Chris,you have to play so campy against ryu and it's so boring and also terrifying
Chris,noooooo fuck ryu
Chris,8/10 of the top ten eliminated before top 8
Chris,"silver lining, canada made top 8"
Chris,but ugh fuck ryu
Chris,9/10
Chris,9/10 of the top ten out before top eight
Chris,what the hell
Chris,4/5 of the top 5 out
Chris,jesus christ
Chris,who is the one still in?
Chris,dabuz
Chris,#4
Chris,My personal pick for who I want to win is captain zack because bayo is super cool
Chris,or fatality
Chris,hhahahaha clearly you've never fought a bayo
Chris,no I never play this game
Chris,yeah I know
Chris,cool to watch
Chris,like falco
Chris,falco is super bad in smash 4
Chris,too bad
Chris,I'm cheering for fatality or marss
Chris,"safe money is on dabuz, kirihara, or captain zack"
Chris,"but then again, safe bets have very much not prevailed this tournament"
Chris,at the same time it'd be so sick to see T or Hikaru win for the low tiers
Chris,it'd be like DK or Yoshi winning evo for melee
Chris,are they in the same approximate place on the tier list or same level of viability because I don't think that those two things are equal comparing smash 4 and melee
Chris,approximate tier list placement
Chris,basically just did ((sm4sh tier list placement) / (number of characters in sm4sh)) * (number of characters in melee) and rounded it
Chris,but honestly in terms of viability it wouldn't be much different
Chris,then again I guess you could argue that this shakes things up (ie if they're making top 8 clearly they're underrated on the tier list and in general considerations of their viability)
Chris,"to summarize, you see why I don't feel like I'm handicapping myself by playing 33rd on the tier list?"
Chris,"I made it on one team, but I have another tryout later"
Chris,gg
Chris,where is my mans @Mr. Airplane
Chris,@Max if you're not still watching we're in top 8
Chris,I'm watching
Chris,what is it with japanese players and covering their faces?
Chris,it's a thing you do when you're sick
Chris,yeah
Chris,kids at my school do it
Chris,thats nice
Chris,"or if people aroudn you are, and I'm assuming they're all mostly staying together so if one of them's sick they're all gonna cover up"
Chris,well the ones from most Asain countries that is
Chris,also captain zack's american
Chris,oh really?
Chris,rip i wanted to watch top 8
Chris,just physicall y janapense
Chris,but now I have csgo stuff
Chris,"even though I'm not a fan of bayo, I'm still cheering for captain zack cause I really want to see someone who's never won a major win the most stacked sm4sh tourney to date"
Chris,I don't like bayo either
Chris,so unless they fight each other I'm cheering against dabuz and kirihara
Chris,that combo was lit though
Chris,yeah
Chris,I'm a little behind you
Chris,should be caught up now
Chris,what character is that little doll that dabuz has with him?
Chris,I don't like bayo but I do like the way captain zack plays
Chris,I missed it I dunno
Chris,description?
Chris,pink hair yellow and black outfit
Chris,it will probably show up again
Chris,shrugs I'll keep an eye out
Chris,same color scheme as his rosa skin
Chris,but with pink hair?
Chris,yeah
Chris,no idea what the doll is
Chris,dabuz has the freest bracket tho
Chris,he's basically guarunteed 2nd
Chris,I wonder if links super lame style or falcons super fast style will be the dominant style of this match
Chris,T's actually pretty aggro for a link
Chris,but that's till not that aggro
Chris,my guess is that Link's gonna dictate the pace just cause it's Fatality
Chris,man has no chill
Chris,but it might not matter
Chris,we shall see
Chris,see? link's not that lame
Chris,I used to play a lot of link
Chris,wouldn't mind seeing him win
Chris,I'm still cheering for fatality
Chris,even if T might be better against dabuz
Chris,cause a) fatality's awesome and b) rosa link would be soooo slow
Chris,do bombs have kill potential?
Chris,sort of
Chris,bombs themselves don't kill
Chris,but they can set up into kills
Chris,T's nuts
Chris,T's nuts
Chris,fucking insane
Chris,true
Chris,what % chance would you give him vs dabuz?
Chris,I have no idea what the matchup's like
Chris,hm
Chris,70-30 in dabuz's favour
Chris,maybe 65-35
Chris,"I can see the sword being able to contest rosa's range, but then also link can't cover his landings with dair cause rosa's up air is so disjoined"
Chris,I wonder if bombs on shield will mess with luma
Chris,I honestly have no idea how the matchup's gonna go
Chris,the more I think the better it seems for T
Chris,"dabuz is a studier and a learner, and I'm gonna assume he didn't really look at T or Link"
Chris,I'm gonna end at 60-40 dabuz
Chris,my god zack what was that combo
Chris,that was disgusting
Chris,and why are you surprised they ranked this character first?
Chris,yes
Chris,due to the lack of results
Chris,I don't think it's reasonable to say someone's the best character when none of the best players play them
Chris,think about the last 2 years of melee. the top fox placing in a tournament is usually 2nd or 3rd while peach's is 1st and fox is still ranked 5 places higher
Chris,and she may have mad punishes but she loses some pretty key matchups and can struggle to approach (did you see how much trouble he was having getting anything started on dabuz)
Chris,I'm not saying you should do it purely by player ranking
Chris,but it's definately a way to get a partial judgement
Chris,"the fact that there's only one puff and one peach in the top 20 or so (I forget where macD is, possibly top 30) should tell you that they aren't as good as their best players make them look"
Chris,whereas there's a ton of fox
Chris,or the characters are seen as boring by the general public so the people attempting to play them are much fewer in number
Chris,which is actually true
Chris,if you look at the distribution of mains
Chris,oh my goodness the disrespect
Chris,CZ gives no fucks about his opponants' feelings
Chris,zero fucks whatsoever
Chris,I missed it what happened?
Chris,"taunted in game, taunted in real life"
Chris,he's taunted so many times
Chris,fthrow taunt is a true combo
Chris,is her taunt an attack?
Chris,no
Chris,he just throws people and then taunts
Chris,let's goooo fatality
Chris,that was probably a hype set too bad I missed it
Chris,I saw the final kill
Chris,and thats it
Chris,fatality's nuts
Chris,kirihara almost reverse 3-0'd him
Chris,and then fatality turned up out of nowhere in the last 30 seconds or so
Chris,@everyone anyone want to play secret hitler tonight
Chris,maybe
Chris,depends how long this tourney goes
Chris,cause this might be the hypest sm4sh tourney I've ever seen
Chris,I agree with that because I find it interesting and i usually don't care to watch smash 4
Chris,a lot of unexpected aggro players doing really well
Chris,I'm hoping the meta evolves this way in the future
Chris,so apparently T has beaten kirihara (the other best rosa) so he might have a chance here
Chris,how much money does the winner get?
Chris,not sure
Chris,not something I really pay attention to
Chris,did you see how much shield damage that fair did? that's like half the shield
Chris,"on an unrelated note, kingston sm4sh discord has seen the return of our most cancerous community member"
Chris,haven't seen him since last year
Chris,the most toxic person I've ever talked to
Chris,the guy who basically stole from me
Chris,"he hosted a tourney at his house, I knocked him out at 4th, got 3rd, he declared only top 2 get money, then on the drive home (with 1st and 2nd) they counted their money and there a chunk missing"
Chris,and now he's back and already trying to start shit
Chris,just kick him from the discord then
Chris,if everyone agrees he is toxic
Chris,except not everyone does
Chris,and he's surprisingly good friends with one of our community leaders
Chris,and the guy who owns the discord
Chris,also I don't want to start shit with him
Chris,and there are even people who argue that the trash talk and stuff is good for the community
Chris,"""your popoff sucks"""
Chris,from the crowd
Chris,lololol
Chris,everyone hates dabuz for some reason
Chris,I love kingston sm4sh discord tho
Chris,"one guy (actually the melee zelda main) comments that, while he doesn't have a winning record against a lot of people, he couldn't think of anyone in the discord that he hasn't beaten"
Chris,then out of nowhere
Chris,"top player in ottawa shows up like ""yo what up?"" and has apparently been here for like half an hour just watching the conversation"
Chris,top tier lurking
Chris,what I want to see more than almost anything right now is fatality to 3-0 zack then give him the irl show me your moves
Chris,but I don't think he's that mean
Chris,let's gooooo fatality
Chris,that was crazy good
Chris,fatality's nuts
Chris,you almost got to see the fatality combo but T was juuuuust too low percent
Chris,that stomp footstool stomp footstool thing?
Chris,yes
Chris,so good
Chris,fatality in grands let's gooooooo
Chris,if he wins that would be so hype
Chris,he could do it
Chris,hard but doable
Chris,this guy makes smash 4 interesting to watch
Chris,these commentators are too loud
Chris,DMs ARE A THING
Chris,USE THEM
Chris,there used to be three of us watching
Chris,sorry
Chris,@here overwatch?
Chris,@Max almost done with tourney?
Chris,possibly
Chris,could be anywhere from one to seven more games
Chris,*one to eight
Chris,no one to seven
Chris,I have not finished my placements
Chris,I'm bad at math
Chris,can't play comp with you
Chris,booooo
Chris,fatality lost
Chris,it was so close but that early kill in the last game ate all his momentum
Chris,still crazy that he got 2nd
Chris,who won the whole thing?
Chris,dabuz
Chris,ah
Chris,"I am 57,358 of all faceit users"
Chris,"out of the 200,000 some that play"
Chris,VP just went 2-13 at half to overtime now
Chris,what map?
Chris,train
Chris,isn't train pretty one sided? didn't we do a similar thing the one time we played train?
Chris,eh it can be
Chris,where we got destroyed CT and then did pretty well on T?
Chris,but still
Chris,13-2
Chris,still impressive
Chris,both teams destroyed ct side though
Chris,shrugs

Chris,Competitive overwatch: episode 1
Chris,so apparently back in the '90s my university's student government had a 3-hour debate on whether or not to approve a campus Star Trek club because their constitution had a policy banning Klingons from being club members which the student government thought failed to promote equality
Chris,wat
Chris,http://kingstonherald.com/news/klingon-equity-queens-university-2010310319
Chris,"Klingon ""Equity"" Cited in Free Speech Grade for Queen's Universi..."
Chris,"AMS ""Student Union actions & practices"" gets a B in national report"
Chris,and yes that is a picture of a klingon photoshopped onto a picture of part of our campus
Chris,@Sak von Sak Thats super dumb
Chris,who cares
Chris,that's a good question
Chris,really funny tho
Chris,yeah
Chris,also proof that it's not just millenials who do weird things in the name of equality
Chris,in your country it started much earlier
Chris,oh don't give me that
Chris,I'm sure if you dug around the states you'd find stuff
Chris,yes
Chris,but you guys have been more progressive from farther back in time
Chris,"yeah, but I don't really qualify this as ""progressive"""
Chris,"more as ""slightly insane"""
Chris,its progressivism taken too far
Chris,although from the article I gather the issue was more about that other actually exclusive clubs could crop up using this as a precedent
Chris,oh that makes sense
Chris,"I mean I feel like it'd be pretty easy to make an argument against that working (""banning a fictional group is very different than banning an actual one, doesn't count as a precedent"") but at this level stuff like this has some legal standing so I can understand the caution and not wanting to have to have that argument"
Chris,My mic wasn't working
Chris,I'm pretty sure sm4sh wario mains have some of the best tags around
Chris,when I was in quebec over the summer there was a guy whose tag was WAHrrior and apparently there's some guy whose tag is EnigWAH
Chris,r/place has ended ;-;
Chris,"so I had this bright idea that cause I'm feeling pretty stressed I'm gonna work while listening to the upbeat/relaxing chunks of the chrono cross ost, and now I'm stuck cause I really just want to go play chrono cross and if there's one thing I really don't have time for it's a ~60 hour rpg"

Chris,it's actually not as bad as I'm making it sound
Chris,I just got called the king of organic chemistry by my teacher
Chris,my part of the term project is done and the course with the assignment I'm donig well enough that I can just not do this assignment and focus on the test (which is worth a much larger chunk of my mark for that course)
Chris,"and then I just have two more assignments, a test, and exams (one of which I'm horribly behind in the class and I'm gonna have to go in for a ton of help, but I've got time)"

Chris,@Bitmin
Chris,Anyone wanna play RoA?

Chris,I feel so bad for you
Chris,Thanks me too
Chris,it's the first week since november that we've had decent weather and I'm too busy to go out and enjoy it
Chris,glances outside oh hey it's started raining maybe being in here's not so bad
Chris,@here how's the new update?
Chris,its too cool for you
Chris,I'm too cool for this update
Chris,its pretty lit
Chris,the uprising event takes a while tho
Chris,I'm so bummed out rn
Chris,don't be
Chris,like its just a few cool skins
Chris,and new lore stuff
Chris,I don't like going on vacation
Chris,^
Chris,like just over a 100 pieces of new content
Chris,it's boring
Chris,honestly
Chris,Vacations are exhausting
Chris,vacations are supposed to be relaxing are u ok
Chris,Home is relaxing
Chris,@Mr. Airplane games are relaxing
Chris,@bois
Chris,@Max
Chris,lets play the new update
Chris,@Feral Nebula
Chris,"@Mr. Airplane I started learning C#, very interesting!!!"
Chris,if you want to play join a channel
Chris,@Trapezoider
Chris,I don't know C# at all @Trapezoider
Chris,@Mr. Airplane Rip dweeb
Chris,wait where did everyone go
Chris,@Zain
Chris,What is everyone doing in here? @here
Chris,nothing really
Chris,just playing the new update
Chris,Am sad
Chris,yuuuuus my linalg prof is so good
Chris,he just put up what every single question on the exam is going to be (not the specific numbers and graphs but what they're gonna be)
Chris,this is so helpful
Chris,linalg?
Chris,Good guy professor
Chris,linear algebra
Chris,super neat math stuff
Chris,Today Ava and trap are going to play a best of 5 rivals set to see who is better
Chris,ooh ooh tell me before it happens I want to watch
Chris,Gg
Chris,alright
Chris,I swear the math profs at queens are all so good
Chris,"best profs I've had these two years have been differential+integral calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math (only in second year, first year discrete math the prof was pretty bad)"
Chris,so math profs are pretty good then I guess
Chris,it's a pretty well funded department cause it overlaps with so many other ones so I assume they can afford really good ones
Chris,"but they're all really good at explaining stuff, have tons of office hours if you need to go in for help, do extra help stuff for tests and exams, have really comprehensive online resources, etc etc etc"
Chris,and as good as it is I kinda wish the prof quality was spread a little more evenly cause some profs suuuuuuck
Chris,possibly the most frustrating is this one guy who's a top guy in his field (his field is pretty specific) but he just can't teach it for shit
Chris,sad
Chris,If anyone was wondering
Chris,
Chris,ABSA IS BAD !?
Chris,Every character is close I just think absa is the worst
Chris,still totally viable
Chris,loud crying
Chris,just my opinion

Chris,Also I have an exam in five and a half hours and I'm wide awake

Chris,that sucks
Chris,sadbois
Chris,  
Chris,@Sak von Sak I learned a shadow combo
Chris,nice nice
Chris,need to make sure I can do it both ways now
Chris,as in both directions
Chris,yeah that's always important
Chris,Good I can
Chris,Fight?
Chris,working on packing and cleaning right now
Chris,maybe later tonight
Chris,okay
Chris,Random question
Chris,http://www.strawpoll.me/12830647
Chris,Which would you rather have control the world?
Chris,Vote Now! [Nazi Germany] [Communist USSR] 
Chris,"I mean, seeing as I'm jewish this is a pretty easy question"
Chris,I'm assuming that very few of us are jews but for you yes its a no brainer
Chris,@Mr. Airplane @waowder wanna do some lockeed practice at around 8:30ish
Chris,@Rotomotorz  im down
Chris,sure
Chris,@waowder
Chris,yo
Chris,http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Codequest+2016+problems
Chris,LMGTFY
Chris,"so I'm skimming parts of the xenoblade x soundtrack, there is a song that is actually just called ""z37b20a13t01t08le"""
Chris,What???
Chris,I HAVE NO IDEA
Chris,by the way new sg character should be fully practiced and ready in a few days
Chris,nice nice
Chris,you're probably gonna surpass me soon
Chris,nah
Chris,I don't have any characters that are actually good other than double
Chris,I thought ms fortune was a good character
Chris,I'm not good with her tho
Chris,oh I see
Chris,also airdash cancling is super easy
Chris,grumbles
Chris,you made it sound impossible
Chris,I don't have the fast hands for it
Chris,you just input a ground dash
Chris,or I'm just doing something wrong mentally
Chris,in the air
Chris,tap foward twice
Chris,then do a move
Chris,yes but I can never seem to do it fast enough for the combo to keep going
Chris,"maybe it's a tighter window on fortune than whoever you're learning (if it's not fortune I'd assume filia, but if it's fortune then I just don't have the hands for it)"
Chris,maybe
Chris,I'll have to try whatever combo your doing and see
Chris,"I'm probably gonna drop fortune, focus on the parasoul (sure her combo's hard but I think with a bit more practice I'll be able to get it) plus I'm way more comfortable with her neutral and openers"
Chris,I do not like fighting characters that outrange me by a significant degree
Chris,this is why I need big band
Chris,she's basically marth with samus missiles
Chris,it's great
Chris,so dumb
Chris,I did a thing
Chris,
Chris,I am a totally different person without hair and it's kind of scary
Chris,So did i
Chris,lol what is that?
Chris,Getting stitches soon
Chris,No games 4 me

Chris,Yup
Chris,wait what happened @Jed
Chris,Was working on a model rocket and xacto knife slipped

Chris,"Most of my pc parts have been delivered, I'm just waiting on my case and operating system"

Chris,The first one is always scary D:
Chris,DONT WORK  ON CARPET DO IT ON A COUNTER

Chris,you think this is a meme?
Chris,the probably is there because I'm not sure I wanted to read that regardless of where it was
Chris,triggered
Chris,LOL
Chris,is Sylki offended
Chris,less by the content than the style and the intentional amount of cringe
Chris,he tried to take credit for writing that
Chris,I did?
Chris,no trap
Chris,I suck at green texts @Sak von Sak
Chris,The only one I tried to write go no comments on 4 chan

Chris,memer
Chris,no
Chris,why dad
Chris,kys
Chris,it's fusion's server I think
Chris,aye
Chris,alright cool
Chris,I thought it was chikons
Chris,But then I realized he doesnt have the highest tier role
Chris,I think old frostbite was
Chris,also I'm pretty sure he's a master memer too
Chris,:[
Chris,also why do you want to be a master memer? what would you do with this untold power?
Chris,Nothing I just want to be up there with you guys
Chris,:[
Chris,the only thing I've used it for is to add the  emote
Chris,I would add a meme emote? and monitor the memes channel to ensure safety of users
Chris,what meme would you use to encapsulate the entirety of meme-hood?
Chris,Holy shit
Chris,P.E.P.E
Chris,actually

Chris,THe mightiest of all memes
Chris,He only appears one in every 69^(infinity) memes
Chris,I'll reserve judgement and leave it up to fusion
Chris,@Zain
Chris,I am the highest tier memer here
Chris,"also I'm considering changing my tag for smash at least, should I go to Young Irish Stew or Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer?"
Chris,Can I have a role that shows up above master memers that has no powers but says master master memers
Chris,Y O U N G I R I S H S T E W
Chris,! ! !
Chris,@everyone I want an opinion
Chris,I like Young Irish Stew
Chris,Erzer Perzer Lermon Squerzer is a mouthful
Chris,^
Chris,Yung without an o
Chris,just for the meme
Chris,"if I do it like that I'd have to shorten every word a bit, I can't thing of a good way to shorten Irish and Stu will make people think that that's my name"
Chris,I guess I could do Yung Irish Stoo
Chris,but I don't think it's as good
Chris,The other name is longer though
Chris,How would you shorten it?
Chris,probably just to Lermon Squerzer
Chris,and the shortening of this one was to have consistency with Yung instead of Young
Chris,@Mr. Airplane are you done building your comp

Chris,I think they focused on the open world part way too much
Chris,YES
Chris,and there's a lot of random grinding for no reason
Chris,I hate the fact that it is non linear
Chris,it makes it hard to tell a good story and properly scale difficulty
Chris,I keep running into enemies that kill me in one hit
Chris,why
Chris,git gud solved yo problem
Chris,did you know that your opinion of open world games is negative does not mean the game is objectively bad
Chris,^
Chris,@Sak von Sak chill avec moi
Chris,Young Irish Stew is typing...
Chris,"For example, what you just described is part of what I like about xenoblade x - they tell you right out the gates that the world is incredibly hostile and you're constantly hearing about people getting attacked and killed by super strong monsters and then it happens to you and you're kinda like ""damn.  Fortunately unlike these sucker npcs I can revive at checkpoints"" and it adds to all the world building"
Chris,"Also I can't right now, maybe later tonight"

Chris,what
Chris,I need this next year
Chris,I don't remember exactly how it works but if you make an amazon account with a student email you can get free prime
Chris,OP
Chris,within canada at least
Chris,so if any of you non-uni kids in canada want to order stuff off amazon you can probably do it through me (although paying me back would be complicated)
Chris,"oh also of note, that free shipping is free ONE-DAY SHIPPING"
Chris,woah
Chris,Yeah just make an account with your student email
Chris,free for a whole year
Chris,pretty sure I've had it more than a year

Chris,@Bitmin
Chris,"toronto weather has gone from ""comfortably cool in jeans and a sweatshirt"" to ""sweating in shorts and a tshirt"" overnight"
Chris,No kidding
Chris,I was dying yesterday
Chris,I was kinda hoping it'd be a one day thing but it seems like it's sticking around
Chris,I feel no sympathy it's hot here all the time
Chris,it's not so bad when you're used to it
Chris,if it was this hot during the summer we wouldn't be complaining
Chris,but it jumped twenty degrees celsius overnight and that's bullshit
Chris,Around here this is basically considered part of summer
Chris,We get summer weather from May to October
Chris,"in fahrenheit, it went from 50 to 86 overnight"
Chris,that's not ok
Chris,86 is comforable
Chris,I wish I had heat
Chris,Comfortable*
Chris,"86 is slightly too hot, but when you're not used to it it's brutal"
Chris,also it's super humid
Chris,Ideal to me is 78
Chris,What humidity number is it?
Chris,69%
Chris,It's even worse when your AC isn't on
Chris,ahahaha our AC's semi busted so it doesn't get everywhere in the house
Chris,Okay I feel sorry for you guys now no ac is rough
Chris,Rip
Chris,fans have become a crucial commodity
Chris,I'm so tired
Chris,I fell asleep at like 3 last night
Chris,So I drank a monster and i was good for a whilr
Chris,But now I am tired again
Chris,I'd say my perfect temperatures are 22 (72ish) or 13 (55ish) depending on what I'm doing
Chris,also ouch
Chris,just force yourself to stay up as long as you can
Chris,Monsters are death in a bottle I would advise against drinking them
Chris,Nah
Chris,eh energy drinks are only bad if you drink like 5
Chris,I mean I don't drink them every day
Chris,admittadly I've never had energy drinks but so long as you don't go crazy with how many you drink and develop a dependancy you're fine
Chris,same with coffee
Chris,I know someone who drinks an energy drink every day and he just went to the dentist and apparently he has a cavity in every tooth
Chris,"when my mum was in college she also worked a night shift, and they had a coffee machine with free coffee and one day she realized that she couldn't function without 13 cups of coffee"
Chris,If I have lot of work to do sometimes I will get a drink with 6 shots of espresso 
Chris,Little bit Overkill but it does the job
Chris,I can stay up super late and focus with no assistance from coffee or monsters
Chris,You also don't go to school
Chris,Being social take a lot of energy
Chris,"Patch Notes For 1.3
Time Counters- Name changed to charge counters.
Knight- Added to the game and ability changed from drawing cards upon killing a creature or hitting a player to paying 2 to draw a card.
Spirit- Removed from the game.
Anti-Mage, Spearman, Grand Arbiter, Stasis Chamber, Sage, Guardian, Blacksmith, Zombie, Sword, The Power of Time, Archives, Thundersurge, Dig, Poke, Silence, Foundry, and Forbid- Added to the game."
Chris,The biggest MCG update yet
Chris,2 new pages of cards
Chris,"I can focus late without caffeine or energy drinks, but not for more than two, maybe three days in a row"
Chris,also Octagon feeling the introvert struggle
Chris,I feel your pain
Chris,I'm not even an introvert
Chris,It's just that being social is a lot of work
Chris,that's the actual definition of introverted
Chris,you can be a super social introvert
Chris,it just takes a ton of your energy
Chris,wanna play games?
Chris,@here
Chris,maybe later tonight

Chris,@Mr. Airplane
Chris,Can I get help with one permutations problem
Chris,@everyone
Chris,In how many orders can four students be lined up against a wall if there are six to choose from
Chris,that makes no sense
Chris,I think 6P4
Chris,360?
Chris,it's been awhile since I did permutations and combinations
Chris,im so confused fml
Chris,I think its 360
Chris,"l;'kadfs;'klafds'lk;fkasd;'lk;l'afdsl;'kkl;'fadslk;'dfaskl;'rewqoip[reqwio[preqwio[prqewio[preqw[iopreqwio[pvcxzm,./cvxzmn.,cvzxnm,.zcvxnm.,zvc"
Chris,if I remember correctly it's 6P4
Chris,if that's an option on your calculator
Chris,thats the equation for permuations taken at a time
Chris,there should be an nPr thing
Chris,tell me if it ends up at 360
Chris,I don't think it's going to
Chris,it doesn't matter that they're taken all at once
Chris,it'd be the same thing if you picked one at a time
Chris,I'm 95% sure it's just 6P4
Chris,"(which actually is 360, either max is a god or he just plugged it in)"
Chris,I did not use a calculator
Chris,I did it in my head
Chris,actually not true
Chris,but I didn't use a P function
Chris,I'm gonna assume you know the full formula for it tho?
Chris,its 6x5x4x3
Chris,easy
Chris,suddenly realizes I've been using the overcomplicated version for if you have repeated elements
Chris,goddamn it higher education for making me forget about simple solutions to stuff
Chris,lol
Chris,figured out why my ping was bad
Chris,I have 2 exchange students staying at my house
Chris,and they are both simultaneously using their phones and laptops
Chris,gg
Chris,rip
Chris,dumb chinese people
Chris,jk
Chris,Does anyone here think its normal to call your friends by their last name?
Chris,I think first name is more friendly so yeah last name is a little wierd
Chris,why?
Chris,someone is trying to convince me it is normal but nAH
Chris,I want opinions of people who arent homeschool though
Chris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gia6en2R0Q&feature=youtu.be I heard you guys like sick tracer highlights
Chris,sick tracer highlight
Chris,we still lost that push and the game :)
Chris,we still lost that push though and the game 
Chris,It is normal in some culture
Chris,And I'm sure if ur name is something hard to say like Uvuvwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwembubwem Ossas then people would probably call you by urn last name
Chris,Some of my friends call me by my last name occasionally
Chris,@Feral Nebula it can be used kinda like a nickname
Chris,Like you don't always call the by their last name
Chris,But sometimes
Chris,I think we need a wall between China and the us
Chris,it very much depends on the person
Chris,"it's rare, but some people prefer last name or middle name to first name"
Chris,there was a guy at my elementary school who everyone called Mac and I didn't learn until grade 4 that that wasn't his actual name
Chris,Our school have a guy we call max but that isn't his realy name
Chris,also a lot of asian kids have a legal name and a given name and would much prefer if you used the given one
Chris,"for example, I have a friend whose actual name is Xenswe, but we all just call him Ben"
Chris,(might be a bit off on the spelling it's been awhile since I've actually seen it)
Chris,It happens a lot in sports too. Probably because your last name is what's on all of your stuff
Chris,also in sports some people's last names are just so clearly better than their first names
Chris,like Stan Warinka
Chris,@waowder csgo?
Chris,Aren't you in school
Chris,no
Chris,we had a test today
Chris,@Jed
Chris,play with us too
Chris,I'm sorta in school though
Chris,What is up my dudes
Chris,Does anyone here find shoulders to be sexy or distracting
Chris,no
Chris,lol no
Chris,literally no one does
Chris,my high school was HILARIOUS(ly dumb) about it tho
Chris,"Can't wear: Shirt that exposes your shoulders or stomach
Can wear: Shirt that exposes a solid 50% of your boobs"
Chris,"I mean if you're gonna bring up the whole distraction thing, boobs are clearly way more distracting than shoulders"
Chris,They tried to send me home
Chris,"but even then, NO ONE IS ACTUALLY IGNORING CLASS TO STARE AT PEOPLE"
Chris,Wait they tried to send you home because you were exposing your shoulders?
Chris,wait they tried to send YOU home for exposing your shoulders?
Chris,Yes
Chris,your a dude
Chris,WAIT WHAT
Chris,why
Chris,hahahaha
Chris,Yup
Chris,that's amazing
Chris,thats so dumb
Chris,your school is a trainwreck
Chris,like are you just wearing a tank top?
Chris,Apparently 2 teachers told the office person that I was wearing a tank top
Chris,Like come on don't be a little bitch just dress code me yourself
Chris,Sorry I am a little heated
Chris,I mean I totally would be to
Chris,dress code is dumb enough already
Chris,the shoulders thing is even dumber
Chris,but I've literally never heard of a GUY getting dresscoded for shoulders
Chris,"""oh no his sculpted physique is distracting the class"""
Chris,wait octagon showed his shoulders in school what a slut
Chris,Ha
Chris,I know I'm a whore
Chris,But get this
Chris,Girls are allowed to wear tank tops
Chris,you should have told them it's within your rights to embrace your physical attractiveness
Chris,WAIT WHAT
Chris,Yup
Chris,why is your school so dumb
Chris,Do you understand my frustration now
Chris,thats so wierd
Chris,I mean I understood it before
Chris,but it just keeps getting worse
Chris,WHAT IS YOUR SCHOOL

Chris,Who knows
Chris,"in general, I would say either have no dress code whatsoever or do uniforms, don't half-ass it"
Chris,"and yeah, uniforms kinda suck but there are arguments to be made for it, and most places would just not have a dress code"
Chris,but god damn your school actually sounds like it has the worst implemented dress code I've ever heard of
Chris,Yes it also is dependent on if the office people like you or not

Chris,proud
Chris,@Bitmin
Chris,picking my degree tomorrow and super stressed about making the wrong choice
Chris,@The Rona what degree are you going to go for?
Chris,Some type of science
Chris,I was thinking of doing science but given my current interests and skill set I think I might do business
Chris,I basically get to design my courses for the first year or so before picking what I want
Chris,cool
Chris,You have to pick something that you're going to enjoy doing in the future
Chris,So keep that in mind I guess
Chris,That was the main reason I decided I probably shouldn't do a science job because I don't really enjoy doing math and I don't want that to be my job
Chris,What type of business do you want?
Chris,business management I think
Chris,don't have to decide the specific type until year 3
Chris,That's pretty cool
Chris,but the general look of the course seems like something I would enjoy and be good at more than the engineering degrees I was looking at before
Chris,Mine is the same
Chris,It is the same in that the specific doesn't come until year 3?
Chris,"Yeah, I have until year 3 to declare a major"
Chris,But I can do it whenever
Chris,Anniversary event

Chris,and the other team isn't letting me play cause I have silver experience from two years ago
Chris,"welp I just rang for a team, and I knew they sucked, but damn they just kicked their roamer cause he didn't know how to rocket jump"

Chris,venue fee mostly

Chris,"$45 for three days of venue fee, twenty dollars for two events, tax"
Chris,the venue fee at TGC the biggest tournament I ever went to was like $5
Chris,"it's pretty rare to see more than 5-10, but I'm not surprised it's more for a major"
Chris,"they have to cover the venue somehow, and I'm sure booking somewhere this big for a whole weekend isn't cheap"
Chris,Done with finals and got a 100% on my last one

Chris,@everyone Question 6 is up
Chris,Who is the person who answered ambidextrous?
Chris,"@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Any opinions before I officially change the cards?            Patch Notes For 1.4 
Necromancer- Cost reduced from 4>3. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 1 creature at night was removed. The ability to revive creatures by sacrificing 2 creatures was restricted to night time only. 
Poison Pump- Name changed to Catapult.
Soldier- HP decreased from 4>2
Barbarian- HP decreased from 2>1
Tribesman- Attack decreased from 2>1
Field Medic- Attack increased from 0>2
Break- Added effect “If this card is countered shuffle it into your deck instead of discarding it.”
Counterspell- You now lose 3 life if you play counterspell by sending a card to the void.
 Extract- The player who played extract now chooses which card gets discarded.
Banish- Added effect “You may not have more than 2 banishes in play at a time”.
Knight- HP increased from 3>4.
Spearman- HP increased from 3>4 Attack decreased from 2>1 Damage dealt by ability increased from 3>4.
Stasis Chamber- HP increased from 2>3
Sage- Cost increased from 1>2 Ability changed to “When Sage destroys a creature or damages a player you may add a spell or instant costing 2 or less to your hand”. Rather than playing the card for free and shuffling it back into your deck.
Zombie- HP increased from 1>2 Attack decreased from 3>2. Now only resurrects if you pay 1 resource.
Thundersurge- HP of creatures killed decreased from 3>1 cost decreased from 3>2.
Dig- HP gained by opponent decreased from 2>1.
Sword- Attack gained by equipped creature increased from 3>4."
Chris,I was fond of old necromancer but I think that's why he's getting nerfed
Chris,old necromancer was OP
Chris,"I don't think soldier was all that good, maybe do 4->3 instead, cause otherwise he's almost too squishy (and you've not got that many cards with more than two hp)"
Chris,18/27 of my creatures have more than 2 HP
Chris,"one necromancer tweak I think would be interesting would be something like you have to sacrifice creatures such that the total health of your sacrificed stuff equals the number of resources you'd need to summon the thing you're bringing back, and maybe half that during the night, cause I liked that aspect of him"
Chris,join voice if you can
Chris,so basically you can drop a creature with only two health left to summon one that would require 2 resource to summon
Chris,I can't
Chris,there are two reasons I didn't do that
Chris,also I don't think barb/tribesman were OP
Chris,1 is there isn't enough room on the card to describe such an effect
Chris,2 is that creatures with high attack on low HP would be to good with it
Chris,how so?
Chris,"you're not doing health -> health, you're doing health -> effective resources"
Chris,oh in that case wall would make that super OP
Chris,true
Chris,didn't think of that
Chris,I think the counterspell nerf is unecessary
Chris,me neither
Chris,also I haven't played with or against a bunch of the cards you're tweaking so I'll leave those up to you
Chris,I'm considering how to make necromancer more interesting in the future but for now I just wanted him to not be OP so we can use him
Chris,he is one of the more unique cards
Chris,also I vote changing the name of poison pump to swarm
Chris,ooh I like that
Chris,thats good
Chris,I'll use that
Chris,cool-cool my work here is done
Chris,I think I'm going to reduce the nerf to soldier and counterspell
Chris,I like the extract change
Chris,but doesn't it mean that you see the other person's hand? or you just pick randomly?
Chris,New changes Soldier- HP reduced from 4>3 Counterspell- Lose 2 HP instead of 3 as I plannned before
Chris,you see the other persons hand
Chris,I feel like that makes it really good then
Chris,not as good as before
Chris,it used to be unquestionably the best card in the game
Chris,and it controlled the meta
Chris,then I nerfed it so hard that no one has really used it since
Chris,I'm trying something new in the hopes that extract will become a good but not OP card
Chris,getting ready for that extract banish combos tho
Chris,oh I didn't think of that
Chris,now I'm glad I nerfed banish a little
Chris,rip my cool ideas
Chris,having half of your deck be dead is an unwinnable position
Chris,also your idea still works
Chris,"yeah, if you can get both in your starting hand that is really good"
Chris,Patch 1.5 might include new cards. If so you guys can recommend some ideas for them.
Chris,time to start working on my storm cycle deck which I will of course be calling storm warning
Chris,lol
Chris,@Rotomotorz league
Chris,dude... wall + sword = op?
Chris,maybe
Chris,wall fury was a deck in the original version of my game
Chris,nice
Chris,Also I forget a patch note
Chris,Archives- Added effect “You may not use this ability on cards that can be recasted”
Chris,MCG V1.4 is now live!
Chris,@Mr. Airplane I made a storm warning deck
Chris,but I was gonna do that tho
Chris,you can also do one
Chris,k
Chris,I just wanted to see the different designes we could come up with
Chris,"did you use like scout, dig, visions, wall and stuff"
Chris,some but not all of those
Chris,cool-cool
Chris,My deck can be reduced to I think 4 cards
Chris,all others banished
Chris,although that may not be necessary
Chris,nice dude
Chris,we can test it later
Chris,"as in like, a different day, I'm bouta go to sleep"
Chris,Cool card idea: Watch 3 (Equipment)- Target creature exists in its own time which can be chosen and changed at any time by whoever controls the Watch.
Chris,I like it
Chris,@everyone Question 7 is up! This one was suggested by aeiou.

Chris,"for my brother's uni graduation, he realized twenty minutes before leaving that he didn't own black socks, so he stole a pair of mine and then lost one in a lake"
Chris,LOL
Chris,rip sock

Chris,yea +
Chris,@waowder quickplay?
Chris,TooLegend#11911
Chris,can confirm - fewer things are worse than going through someone else's poorly commented css and trying to figure out what everything does
Chris,saem
Chris,css?
Chris,"stands for cascading style sheet, it's basically what manages colours and fonts and a million other little things on webpages"
Chris,"in general, html says what goes where, css says how it looks"
Chris,and I'm digging through someone else's css and trying mostly by trial and error to figure out what affects what
Chris,and it's brutal
Chris,@Bitmin want to play overwatch in like 30 minutes?

Chris,"also an unrelated question for all you americans, do ketchup chips actually not exist in the states?"
Chris,i have no idea what a ketchup chip is
Chris,nah i'm pretty sure ketchup chips are just a canada thing
Chris,I don't even like ketchup chips but I cannot imagine them not existing
Chris,like
Chris,"literally any time anyone is getting chips for a party or something, you can't NOT bring ketchup chips cause someone there is going to love them"
Chris,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Chris,17 quadrillian degrees dude
Chris,Is it a ketchup flavored chip?
Chris,nah it's chip flavored ketchup
Chris,yeah there's like a ketchup powder thing on it
Chris,that feel when you remember bitmins name used to be bitshock
Chris,WHAT
Chris,I THOUGHT THOSE WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
Chris,well it took the temperature going up to 34 for my family to turn on the AC but at this point I'm just glad it's on
Chris,(also for you americans that's like 93 fahrenheit)
Chris,It's supposed to get that hot in a few days where I am
Chris,And I'm excited
Chris,I love hot weather
Chris,this is too hot for anything other than going to the beach
Chris,ideal temperature is 15-22
Chris,(basically 60-70)
Chris,I prefer between 70-80
Chris,that's probably the second best range
Chris,"also -10 to 0 is pretty nice for winter stuff, cause there's still snow but it's not actually all that cold"
Chris,We rarely get snow FeelsBadMan
Chris,Though we did this year and schools were closed multiple days for like 3 inches
Chris,lololol if canadian schools closed for three inches we'd be off from like mid december till mid march
Chris,with a few weirdly warm days in the middle
Chris,@Jed I'm at a lake so we can use our boat
Chris,"USA and  Canada World Cup teams will be revealed this Thursday at E3 at 5 PM PST, will play against each other in showmatch"

Chris,I was driving through LA yesterday
Chris,And I realized 2 things
Chris,1. Driving in big cities sucks balls
Chris,2. E3 is happening in LA this week
Chris,@Mr. Airplane meme with me
Chris,no
Chris,pls
Chris,no
Chris,y
Chris,how could you
Chris,ur not a tur fren
Chris,tru*
Chris,not on computer
Chris,So???
Chris,I'm sulking
Chris,meme on phone then
Chris,too busy sulking
Chris,lameo
Chris,"He got dumped ok, let him sulk in peace"
Chris,can't spell kameron without name
Chris,cuz his name is trah lmao gg
Chris,i cry
Chris,and also sulk
Chris,that too
Chris,shulk?
Chris,monando
Chris,no
Chris,nintendo's presentation kinda sucked btw
Chris,did we get anything on xenoblade 2?
Chris,ye
Chris,some anime trailers
Chris,no gameplay really
Chris,E3 was pretty lacking this year
Chris,agreed
Chris,suddenly remembers that a) I don't have a switch and b) they're like $600 and c) I don't have $600 to spend on a switch
Chris,nothing was really stand out in any of the presentations
Chris,My friend just got one today
Chris,He went to ebgames during lunch and they had 3 in stock
Chris,naisu
Chris,still not worth tho
Chris,no games
Chris,also he should sell it and profit
Chris,And it was only ~$550 including Zelda
Chris,kameron they have a 40 minute xenoblade gameplay video
Chris,that is a lot of gameplay
Chris,that's not the presentation bruh
Chris,and goddamn it they kept the main character's hella dumb design
Chris,ye
Chris,the game is honestly pretty ugly
Chris,man is wearing hollow harem pants with short shorts under them
Chris,why
Chris,also yeah it doesn't look great
Chris,like ps2.5 graphics
Chris,literally looks worse than x
Chris,which has the terrifying uncanny valley people
Chris,"looks almost as bad as the original, but they don't really compensate with cool looking stuff"
Chris,"but the environments just aren't great in this one, and sure the stylization for the characters means they don't look bad graphically, but they just look awful aesthetically"
Chris,ye
Chris,also the fuck is that girls bust
Chris,I'm 95% that's not how boobs work
Chris,what are you some kinda doctah?
Chris,remembers Fiora and Sharla and basically every female character other than Melia ok I guess that's always kinda been there
Chris,doctor ur supposed to respond because I mentioned medical professionals
Chris,starts watching the trailer THAT IS THE CHRONO TRIGGER OPENING YOU JUST STOLE
Chris,after a brief double check it's the same composer so I guess it's fine
Chris,also HYPE it's the same composer as chrono trigger
Chris,I have not been super hyped for a game and then actually liked the game in such a long time
Chris,last game may have been rivals of aether
Chris,literally after looking at what they have to show the only thing I'm hyped for in xenoblade2 is the soundtrack
Chris,also the boat is still broken rip
Chris,seriously the world looks pretty awful and the character design is actually horrible
Chris,"I swear to god the previous games have so many good character designs (if occasionally poor implementation cause meh graphics), and then SERIOUSLY WHAT IS THIS SHIT https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/e/ee/Switch_XenobladeChronicles2_E32017_character_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20170613180929"
Chris,I left my computer ok man
Chris,DO YOU REALLY NEED ALL THOSE BELTS
Chris,no
Chris,Those belts aren't even holding anything
Chris,Except for the one around his waist
Chris,"and the main female character is made of fanservice - super skinny, giant boobs, basically no clothing, and shorts so short they barely even qualify as shorts"
Chris,thats just sad
Chris,I mean there's always been a bit of fanservice in this series but that's taking it up a few too many levels
Chris,they're basically at the level before kill la kill and THAT SHIT WAS A PARODY OF OVERDONE FANSERVICE
Chris,I'm ok witht eh guy design but the pyra girl whatever is a little much
Chris,"that also somehow managed to slip some actual good character designs in around the fanservice, which xenoblade 2 is very much not"
Chris,"I was kinda hoping they'd do something about the characters after the first trailer came out way back when and everyone kinda went ""wow those characters look terrible"" but nope"
Chris,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Chris,"on the plus side, unless they pull their shit together I no longer have a reason to drop $600 on a switch"
Chris,Splatoon 2?
Chris,Mario Odyssey?
Chris,Kirby Switch?
Chris,FE Switch?
Chris,can we talk about mario oddesssy for a second
Chris,Arms?
Chris,arms is bad
Chris,Metroid 4?
Chris,the free trial was 0 fun
Chris,and how fucking bizzare a cartoonish character looks in a moderately (or at least anatomically accurate) world?
Chris,But it doesnt even look that bad
Chris,I'm not sold on it
Chris,it's a pretty clashing visual style
Chris,"both can work well on their own, but together it's just weird"
Chris,it'd be like anime characters showing up in american cartoons
Chris,also why does nintendo keep making dynasty warriors style games
Chris,"sure hyrule warriors was kind of a cult classic but I feel like a lot of that was people following the LoZ train, and they're kinda boned doing it with series with smaller fanbases"
Chris,Fire Emblem has a respectable fanbase
Chris,"Fire Emblem, sure, but why are they making a Fate/ one? no one actually likes anything other than the animes and the vn"
Chris,they'll lose it if they only have awakening fates and marth so
Chris,"lol ""respectable fanbase"""
Chris,maybe if they added some of the other games
Chris,it'll probably still sell fine with just awakefates + marth
Chris,I mean they got a decently spread cast for heroes (sure it's pretty skewed but at least they got SOME from other games)
Chris,Lmao these Splat Tim memes are so good
Chris,huh?
Chris,In the splatoon tournament at E3
Chris,Tim is a us memeber who got like a 3v1 doubel
Chris,and now the chat memes whenever he does something
Chris,he's not even the best player on the US team but he's a good meme
Chris,(I know nothing about splatoon but that seems cool)
Chris,oh boy the US won
Chris,does this mean the US is finally good at an esport lmao
Chris,@Rotomotorz league
Chris,Actually
Chris,looking at Pyra she's not much worse than fiora
Chris,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch
Chris,no
Chris,kys
Chris,will do budy
Chris,am not your buddy pal
Chris,am not your pal buddy
Chris,your not my friend unfriended on bnet get fucked lil bitch
Chris,oh......
Chris,com'on man that was too far...
Chris,good god the final mission of xenoblade x is hard
Chris,I mean I might be like 5 levels lower than the boss I'm trying to fight but still
Chris,I keep knocking off most of his health and getting so damn close and then he kills me
Chris,"fuck you, fat man in a large mech"
Chris,"FUCK IT I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW A FEW LEVELS HIGHER AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHOSE BIRTHRIGHT IS PAIN, ASSHOLE"
Chris,lol someone is a little upset
Chris,bastard has so much health
Chris,and he keeps spawning stuff that has lots of health
Chris,and then he goes invincible AND REGENS HIS HEALTH
Chris,AND THEN SPAWNS MORE THINGS
Chris,wow that sounds terrible to play against
Chris,I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S THE FINAL BOSS I'M ONLY ON PART 3/5 OF THE MISSION
Chris,also it's actually a pretty fun fight
Chris,but I'm really feeling the AI handicap
Chris,I feel like if somehow I could have three additional humans handling my party members I could win this fight
Chris,Is that possible?
Chris,nope
Chris,but hey at least the ai's not as bad as in the original
Chris,and at least the music's hella badass
Chris,@Rotomotorz league?
Chris,sure hold up i'm patching
Chris,@Bitmin @Mr. Airplane overwatch

Chris,I almost predicted it
Chris,my logic was so almost but not quite correct
Chris,was it a good game?
Chris,yee
Chris,"definately have some issues with the game, but overall good"

Chris,Going to attend the MCG conference tomorrow?
Chris,probably yeah
Chris,can't wait to be back
Chris,also I swear they saved like all the best songs for the last little bit
Chris,pre-final boss - awesome music
Chris,final boss - awesome music
Chris,"cutscene in between the two of those, hella pretty"
Chris,credits theme - damn good
Chris,"most of the rest of the game - occasional scattered good songs here and there but the ones you hear a lot (normal battle theme, hub area, etc) kinda crappy"
Chris,aw really you're gonna end it on another twist and leave some stuff totally unexplained
Chris,dammit
Chris,you'd better make a fucking sequel

Chris,and they also haven't emailed me back about a whole bunch of stuff for like two weeks -_-
Chris,rip thats pretty unprofessional of them

A blooperberry
why"
Chris,What is a smokers favorite kind of berry?
Chris,A rasp-berry
Chris,oh my god
Chris,I am the pun king
Chris,@Zain can I make a daily pun text channel?
Chris,sure
Chris,NICE
Chris,Oh I forgot to say last night about the Your Eternal Reward that your cloak drains 50% faster
Chris,@Max @Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak
Chris,wow that's awful
Chris,I mean no one used it anyway
Chris,but why encourage people to not use it even more
Chris,That's what I'm saying
Chris,I like how it is now
Chris,"It's supposed to be a fun gimmick, not a viable weapon"
Chris,@here ovahwatch???
Chris,@Bitmin @Zain
Chris,@Mr. Airplane level up that alt man
Chris,mmmmk
Chris,Rip computer
Chris,IM DECAYING :[
Chris,@Mr. Airplane @Zain 6 wins and 2 losses so far in my placements.
Chris,I think my mother board is dead
Chris,wow that sucks
Chris,didn't you just get a new computer
Chris,Well it isn't new
Chris,The motherboard was still stock
Chris,And had been used somewhat
Chris,@Bitmin 5 mins
Chris,oh shit I though the life is strange sale was $5 per chapter but it's $5 for the whole thing
Chris,I MUST GET IT
Chris,that is cheap
Chris,"Did you paly the demo, Quick?"
Chris,no
Chris,I still haven't finished the demo but I'm liking what I've seen so far (and yes I know that wasn't directed at me)
Chris,but 5 dollars for the whole thing is worth it
Chris,"it's on sale till the 5th, give the demo a shot first"
Chris,"Also by demo, it's actually the full first episode"
Chris,Also I got a Switch today!
Chris,
Chris,cool-cool
Chris,nice nice
Chris,SYLKI HOW DARE YOU STEAL MY SAYING AFFIRMATIVE WORDS TWICE THING
Chris,thats my thing
Chris,I SAY NICE NICE ALL THE TIME
Chris,THATS A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Chris,YOU'RE A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT
Chris,THATS NOT VERY NICE NICE TO SAY
Chris,also code geass is really good
Chris,yeeee
Chris,how far are you?
Chris,curently on episode 15
Chris,and the code geass binge continues
Chris,it's impossible to not binge your first time through
Chris,feelsbadman?
Chris,I watched the whole thing in four days
Chris,both seasons?
Chris,and the first 46 episodes in 3
Chris,yeah the whole thing
Chris,wait how many seasons are there?
Chris,just two right?
Chris,just the two
Chris,c2 is confusing
Chris,they're doing a third but there's a decent chance it's just a cash grab cause apparently the studio's not doing so well and it does seem odd that they'd suddenly rejuvinate the series like 9 years later
Chris,WOW CHIKON YOURE SUCH A WEEABOO
Chris,yur bad at overwatch
Chris,ok
Chris,at least I'm not a filthy weeb
Chris,OH WAIT XDDDD
Chris,yeah I was gonna say
Chris,you have an animoo profile picture
Chris,shhh
Chris,we dont talk about that
Chris,at least you're not like the closet weeb from kingston
Chris,"apparently, changing his tag to Kaneki ""wasn't a weeb thing or anything"""
Chris,LOL
Chris,"but at the moment his profile picture is Rem from re zero and that whole ""not a weeb thing"" is looking even less plausible than before"
Chris,he just needs to accept it
Chris,being a weeb is fun
Chris,hear hear
Chris,"(don't kill me kameron, hear hear is a thing that needs to go twice)"
Chris,lol
Chris,YOU SHALL BE PUBLICALLY EXECUTED SYLKI FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST MY IDIOSYNCRASIES
Chris,OBJECTION!
Chris,you can't make me
Chris,"also, @Mr. Airplane @The Rona @Rotomotorz you guys want to try starting the race over tonight?"
Chris,Maybe
Chris,If I'm not caught up playing Zelda :L
Chris,Maybe as well
Chris,"Look out for a Discord user by the name of ""Kazuto Kirigia "" with the tag #2169 .

Chris,Can you review a vod for me later
Chris,Im uploading it to youtube and could really use some feedback on this particular loss 
Chris,sure
Chris,@Zain
Chris,"Thank you im uploading it now. I played mostly mcree, but threw in some stall heroes at the end"
Chris,
Chris,@everyone
Chris,so close to my season high
Chris,Oh wait this belongs in the memes channel
Chris,@everyone i lent trap my adblocker account and he won feelzgoodman
Chris,Feels good man
Chris,"don't know if anyone here still plays fe heroes but the voting thing is crazy close - they're apart by ~1.2 million points, which seems like a lot execpt that the scores are both almost thirty BILLION"
Chris,aka they differ by 0.012%
Chris,voting on what?
Chris,it's basically waifu wars
Chris,"(this time at least, normally it's not JUST girls)"
Chris,who are the two characters being voted on?
Chris,this time around it was basically who's the best healer character and it's ended up narrowed down to elise and priscilla
Chris,and given that I never used priscilla in fe7 I'm backing elise
Chris,we're down 1.2 million
Chris,So your supposed to vote on character strength?
Chris,naw just how much you like the character
Chris,So even if one is clearly better you could still vote for the other just because you like them better?
Chris,yeah
Chris,also all the healers kinda suck in this game
Chris,so you're not really voting for whoever's the strongest
Chris,and while you do get slightly better prizes if you win it's not really that significant
Chris,i am confirmed masters player

Chris,is making Obama look good a bad thing?
Chris,I wanted him out
Chris,why?
Chris,because his political opinions didnt align with his
Chris,Too many reasons to explain in text but to put it simply I am a Republican and he is not so why wouldn't I want him out.
Chris,I mean being a Republican doesn't mean you have to dislike a Democratic nominee.
Chris,A nominee which I disagree with on 90%+ of issues is not going to have my support.
Chris,^^^
Chris,truth
Chris,Well what did you not agree with him on?
Chris,nearly everything
Chris,Remember the part where he said there was too much to explain over text
Chris,^^^

Chris,do it
Chris,you won't
Chris,lol
Chris,already did it
Chris,I just had the dumbest shift of my life
Chris,shift was 300-530
Chris,"I get paid by the delivery, and no one orders food during that time period"
Chris,normally I'd get two or three deliveries for that
Chris,"I got one delivery, and I had to wait till 445"
Chris,wow that sucks
Chris,delivery fee - $7
Chris,tip - $21
Chris,I'll take it
Chris,"so basically I sat around for two hours, worked for twenty minutes, made almost $30"
Chris,sounds like a weird job
Chris,like not profitable very much
Chris,or am I wrong?
Chris,yeah it's super not profitable
Chris,"it pays well per hour, especially if you can get a dinner shift (530-830 is suuuuch a good shift to get), but there aren't many shifts"
Chris,seriously the 530-830 pays about $20 an hour

Chris,IDK
Chris,Why does hyp keep getting kicked
Chris,He doesn't do anything wrong
Chris,because no one likes him
Chris,???
Chris,Mrd do you like hype
Chris,"To me, it seems like he doesn't care about us. Maybe? Dunno."
Chris,No he likes being in here. He really wants to be involved
Chris,that's too bad
Chris,Who keeps kicking him?
Chris,he is banned
Chris,Really?
Chris,yes
Chris,fusion was the one who kicked him the first time and trap invited him back
Chris,I honestly have no clue.
Chris,Why is he banned
Chris,What did he do
Chris,@Jed
Chris,I did have one experience where he just joins a channel other people are in and just leaves.
Chris,I do that
Chris,Maybe invite him back and ask him
Chris,"And if he gives a valid reason, ban him again, unless you hate him"
Chris,
Chris,Okay okay point taken!
Chris,it was agreed upon by many people to ban him
Chris,so it stands
Chris,I didn't hear about that so I didn't know.
Chris,Nah
Chris,That's not valid there wasn't a vote
Chris,When fusion gets back we're taking a vote
Chris,no
Chris,max is admin
Chris,Yes
Chris,For now
Chris,Then ask him
Chris,I will talk to Fusion about this when he gets back for now I will drop it
Chris,4 of the master memers agreed
Chris,fusion kicked him in the first place
Chris,4 out of 8
Chris,That's not even a majority
Chris,"(for the record I just kinda shrugged my shoulders and didn't vote, but I'm not against it, I can see why he rubs a lot of people the wrong way)"
Chris,and the others don't even know him
Chris,That doesn't include the other members
Chris,"also let's be fair, smithy and bitmin are hardly around, fusion's gone and left max in charge"
Chris,"All I'm saying is when fusion gets back, I'm going to ask to have this reconsidered"
Chris,"He's my friend, and I really like having him around"
Chris,That is all
Chris,/End
Chris,woah
Chris,private calls are a thing
Chris,who knew
Chris,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chris,/End
Chris,"Who knew, weaponized autism is a thing that infects over 69 million 8 sided shapes a year"
Chris,༼ つ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ  that's where you're wrong kiddo
Chris,aight if this keeps devolving into throwing shit at each other I'm gonna have to request that you just do it in pms
Chris,when you lose control of a situation it automatically shoots to insults huh
Chris,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Chris,I'm done
Chris,also I realize I could have done a sick pun with pms and PMs but I wasted the opportunity
Chris,dang
Chris,"""If you guys are gonna go all PMS on each other I'd appreciate if you did it through PMs"""
Chris,boom
Chris,what a missed opportunity
Chris,rip
Chris,I'm not the one who started with a bad attitude about this. Also okay @Sak von Sak I'll move this so I don't end up bannerinod

Chris,@Trapezoider
Chris,newt films?
Chris,one of the things I love about one of the webcomics I'm reading is that everyone who reads it has been conditioned to it being depressing so that any time something nice happens we all get really scared
Chris,even though nothing particularly bad has happened for like five chapters (of seven)
Chris,but you can't just kill off half the cast two chapters in and not expect people to be constantly nervous
Chris,@Jed thank you yes
Chris,yeah boi

Chris,

Chris,Mayo @Rotomotorz
Chris,@Jed
Chris,The feeling when you skip your families arbitrary religious weekly ceremony of church so your parents unplug the router and lock the door leaving you home alone without internet
Chris,But then you discover you have an lte hotspot your pc can connect to
Chris,Feelsgoodman
Chris,Can't you just plug the router back in?
Chris,The door to the router is locked
Chris,I don't know where the key is
Chris,:(
Chris,Use a Bobby pin
Chris,How tho
Chris,Is it ez
Chris,??
Chris,It's just one of those little hole locks right?
Chris,Ye I think so
Chris,Lemme check
Chris,Yeah
Chris,I used to do that all the time as a kid
Chris,if you have enough data to get on discord you have enough data to look up how to pick locks
Chris,^
Chris,Okay
Chris,Let me discover a Bobby pins
Chris,Pin*
Chris,although you may end up convincing your parents that you're basically just slowly backing into the depths of hell and you'll be in even more trouble
Chris,just a warning
Chris,Yeah if you plug it back in they'll be angry
Chris,Risk/reward
Chris,My parents think I'm going to hell because I subscribe to evolution as the most practical model of biological origins
Chris,So that's a good point
Chris,I mean aside from the hell thing you'll still probably get in more trouble
Chris,They half jokingly talk about it like that. Not sure if they mean it
Chris,Feelsvadman
Chris,Pc thrown in trashcan 
Chris,Lol
Chris,I would kms
Chris,And sabotage my dad
Chris,oh yeah that was just fantastic when it happened
Chris,I just used it as a metaphor/emphasis thingy/whatever you would call it dammit it's been too long since I took english as a class
Chris,Wait
Chris,Jed will tweezers work?
Chris,I can't find Bobby pins
Chris,Probably not
Chris,if you're talking about a regular locked door a screw driver works
Chris,That too
Chris,at least my type of doors
Chris,A tiny one?
Chris,I have a tiny one
Chris,try it
Chris,Does it need to be flathead?

Chris,Yes
Chris,Also now my mother hates me for not going to church

Chris,Ye
Chris,They r dumb
Chris,Are they in the house right now?

Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,he left
Chris,How good are you with web elements

Chris,Okay
Chris,I'll wait for fusion xd
Chris,"Dang shroud makes almost 250,000 a year just off twitch subs"
Chris,Assuming they are all the cheapest sub option

Chris,or rivals
Chris,or anything
Chris,@here
Chris,anyone good with wordpress??
Chris,I am possibly down for things
Chris,sure
Chris,http://newtfilms.com
Chris,Newt Films
Chris,The Future of Filmmaking
Chris,@here
Chris,what do you guys think so far
Chris,NOt done
Chris,Just general theme n stuff
Chris,"it looks nice but one small thing, why is youtube green?"
Chris,All the bright colors make me feel like its and ad
Chris,maybe that's just me
Chris,they're not that bright
Chris,You got a reason why blue green yellow purple are your main colors
Chris,im gonna try and figure out how to change the stuff to red black and white
Chris,Thats our colors
Chris,I agree that youtube should be red for recognizeability
Chris,yeah
Chris,Cant figure out how to do it with the assets Im using
Chris,said bois
Chris,Oh in that case it's fine then
Chris,also a newt film logo or something instead of the cavern maybe?
Chris,thats why I asked if anyone is good with wordpress
Chris,or something film related at least
Chris,ALso thank you for feedback
Chris,okay our logo actually looks like ass
Chris,No if those are you colors then it makes more sense to stick to those instead
Chris,whats wrong with your logo?
Chris,I thought it was fine other than the art maybe having a few minor mistakes
Chris,
Chris,that just looks so ugly to me
Chris,Bleh
Chris,Put the newt on top of films
Chris,
Chris,This one looks good
Chris,On business cards
Chris,Just elegant
Chris,Simple
Chris,Not so IN YOUR FACE BYATCH
Chris,Eh
Chris,"I think if you put the newt on tip of films, starting from the right edge of the F and then extending to the end of the S, it'll look fine"
Chris,lol that logo took our guy like 6 months because hes a lazy piece of shit. I hardly want to ask him to do another thing. Gotta find another guy tbh
Chris,does anyone have the old frostbite logos. Also thank you @Rotomotorz
Chris,"However also make the height of the word newt taller than the gap between the top of the F and the top of the I, so it doesn't look like Fnewt films lol"
Chris,lmao gonna steal them 
Chris,no just curious
Chris,Lol frostbite
Chris,I built a new pc
Chris,So I lost them
Chris,be there soon octagon

Chris,"Eighth-grader Shigeo ""Mob"" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks. In order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Reigen Arataka, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Chris,no nerd
Chris,why
Chris,doc = too tired
Chris,gg
Chris,I'm super tired man
Chris,doc is a dork
Chris,.org
Chris,where did that joke originate?
Chris,Umm guys
Chris,Umm trap
Chris,@Rivals of Aether Someone play against my ori
Chris,@ me anytime to play
Chris,oh shit that's out?
Chris,goddammit I'm still stuck with my terrible internet
Chris,When do you think you'll be back?
Chris,shrugs
Chris,he's not getting better as fast as he was supposed to (largely because he's super stubborn and not doing all the stuff he's supposed to to help him get better) so I can't even really follow the doctor's estimate cause that was supposed to be sunday
Chris,is he fun tho?
Chris,yes
Chris,However I'm still in the SDing when going offstage due to not knowing when I can jump out of my arials phase.
Chris,lol
Chris,His recovery is definitely the best in the game if you are high and definitely the worst if you are low
Chris,well actually wrastor is probably better high
Chris,All around air is just as good as I thought it would be
Chris,he seems pretty nuts from what little I've seen
Chris,and I feel like he's gonna be one of the those characters with a steep learning curve
Chris,aka I'll probably suck at him
Chris,From what I can tell his weakness is having 0 kill setups
Chris,still gonna give him a shot once I'm back home
Chris,I think I'm going to try and get good at him
Chris,wait that seems kind of crippling
Chris,or does he just have enough stuff that can kill that it doesn't really matter?
Chris,His smash attack hitboxes are REALLY BIG
Chris,like BIG
Chris,its insane
Chris,like etalus big?
Chris,bigger
Chris,the fuck
Chris,etalus fsmash actually covers 1/4 - 1/3 of the stage (depending on the stage)
Chris,That is because he moves
Chris,not because the hitbox is big
Chris,it covers less space than etalus fsmash but the hitboxes on upsmash and downsmash are huge
Chris,so basically big band? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/276801025258684416/288837755247525889/bb-cmk.png
Chris,but with a small hurtbox
Chris,not that big
Chris,at some point we eventually need to play more SG
Chris,(I say while trying to learn blazblue)
Chris,Ori will be good at edgeguarding etalus
Chris,he has a move that is almost exactly like wrastors down smash
Chris,return of the downsmash vs tech wars of early 2017
Chris,@Sak von Sak I think Ori is going to be one of my favorite characters
Chris,@Jed ROA?
Chris,in a bit]
Chris,@ me when ready
Chris,@Max
Chris,@Max what are the best melee ai?
Chris,Link and captain falcon in vanilla
Chris,umm
Chris,But probably fox on the latest 20xx since he has actual tech skill
Chris,that's not what max said he said gannon was best
Chris,i don't remember the other one though
Chris,Max has done several ai tournaments and pretty sure link has won them all almost
Chris,Luigi
Chris,Wait.falcon may have been bad
Chris,Yeah Luigi and link I think

Chris,Yeah kameron too

Chris,too bad its rain and not snow xd @ oregon
Chris,we actually had snow last year
Chris,but also rain
Chris,mostly just rain
Chris,I've seen it snow enough in a single night that it practically shut down the city for about a week
Chris,yay canada
Chris,woah
Chris,same
Chris,"except it was like 4"""
Chris,still basically shut down the city 
Chris,Yeah seriously
Chris,Oregon drivers are pussies
Chris,yeah thats pathetic
Chris,Gets single snow flake
Chris,to be fair
Chris,west salem is hills
Chris,"""SHUTDOWN WHOLE DAMN ROAD"""
Chris,and it was ice under snow
Chris,Ava Texans are no better with snow xD
Chris,also we have like what 1 snow plow?
Chris,"well there is no snow to speak of, ever"
Chris,"it was some weird freak of temperature and stuff where it snowed a ton, rained a bit, then the rain froze, the whole city was under like a foot of ice, massive power outages across the city, technically drivable but horrifyingly unsafe roads (which we used anyway to make it somewhere with power)"
Chris,at least in southern texas
Chris,one of my friends who lives three blocks from me had no power for three weeks
Chris,aaaAAAA
Chris,no power makes me wanna die
Chris,"no internet, no a conditioner/heater, to way to make food"
Chris,try no power and temperature below freezing
Chris,how did you live
Chris,we ran away to somewhere with power
Chris,"if you couldn't do that, layers and layers of clothing and blankets, use of fireplaces, sharing body heat, etc."
Chris,sounds terrible
Chris,sometimes im salty I never get snow but then I hear about how bad snowy places have it
Chris,"""sharing body heat"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Chris,"that's by far the worst I've seen, usually it isn't so bad"
Chris,but honestly snow's not all it's cracked up to be
Chris,it's nice for the first month or so
Chris,then it's kinda annoying
Chris,my childhood dreams are crushed
Chris,and come february/march you just want nothing to do it anymore
Chris,
Chris,yeah its novelty wears off fast
Chris,"skiing and skating and sledding and snowball fights are still fun, but you kinda stop doing any of that after the first bit"
Chris,I love ice skating but the nearest rink is like an hour away
Chris,rip
Chris,nowhere I've stayed in canada has had a rink more than like a fifteen minute walk away
Chris,time to move
Chris,15 minute WALK?
Chris,yeah
Chris,How many ice rinks must there be to have one so close to everyone
Chris,shrugs welcome to canada
Chris,also generally I've only stayed in family-focused residential areas so those tend to have rinks nearby
Chris,"To be sure of hitting the target, shoot first and call whatever you hit the target."
Chris,some quote ^
Chris,That sounds so awesome
Chris,I'm really into skating sports
Chris,I'm kinda good for a novice
Chris,Lodda fun
Chris,I'm pretty awful at em but they're a good time
Chris,@everyone let's do the Meetup in Canada

Chris,yeah
Chris,"I can't go to Canada, no way my parents would let me"
Chris,too far
Chris,good we don't want you

Chris,depresso
Chris,that means max wouldnt go either
Chris,nah max is an adult
Chris,he's 17
Chris,and living at home
Chris,but will be 18 by the time we go anywhere
Chris,yeah but I'm sure our parents will still stop him
Chris,I'm just sad we don't have enough west coasters to justify going somewhere where there's in&out
Chris,yeah
Chris,I mean if you guys want to come out I wouldn't be opposed
Chris,eh transport'll be way more
Chris,and this way I don't have an excuse
Chris,they have them in texas
Chris,thats the furthest east I think
Chris,This is getting insane
Chris,I saw someone riding a jet ski on a road I sometimes drive on...
Chris,oh god that's amazing
Chris,Not if you live here and may have to evacuate.
Chris,We might be running out of roads to leave on.
Chris,true
Chris,So are you gonna leave soon
Chris,are things still good where you are?
Chris,We just learned that leaving is impossible at this point. So it looks like we are going to have to camp on our second story if things get bad.
Chris,For the moment though things are still okay.
Chris,but you mostly live up there anyway so...
Chris,True but we will have to cut the power to the house.
Chris,Well shoot
Chris,Stay safe man
Chris,that sucks
Chris,yeah stay safe and keep us posted
Chris,I'll update you guys if things get worse
Chris,Thanks for the support
Chris,np
Chris,Yo if you have to cut power you won't have discord right?
Chris,don't die
Chris,I have a phone now
Chris,do you have data tho?
Chris,yes
Chris,That's my number
Chris,(oh right it's the states data's way cheaper)
Chris,"@Max  question, if you do have to camp on the second floor, would it be possible just to cut power to the first floor?"
Chris,I'm not sure
Chris,woah what an idea
Chris,that could save my sanity
Chris,i ask cause one of my friends is in the same situation you might be in and they only cut breakers to the first floor
Chris,Ava it's literally flooding and you worry about wifi
Chris,it isnt about wifi

Chris,mrd where are you at?
Chris,cause don't you live near max?

Donald J Trump sits straight up in his interview chair. In his pitifully tiny hands, he hold a smartphone. He is using the front facing camera to check himself out, and preen himself up as he prepares to be on camera
TRUMP (TO SELF)
You're a winner Donald, a winner I tell yah
Donald winks to himself and clicks off the phone, and puts it into his pocket
DIRECTOR
President Trump, are we ready to roll yet sir?
TRUMP

You bet it James! 
Trump says as he winks
TRUMP
Are the incredible men and women on this set ready to capture my fantastic appearance today? 
JAMES
Yes President Trump. We have been preparing for this shoot for a few weeks. Were all very eager to get this over with.
TRUMP
Fantastic!
James walks out of frame and trump sits up extra straight in his seat.

Alright Everybody!
A grip walks across frame carrying a boom mic, people are scrambling into posistion

Bright lights turn on to illuminate trumps and his interview area

Camera heads swivel into posistion
JAMES
Action!
A slate man appears in front of the main camera and clicks the slate board.
James nods to trump
TRUMP
I will never forget, the day I won the election in 2016. It was amazing, truly fantastic. Really shows that america is a nation of faith, a nation of faith in me. Donald J trump. 
Trump looks down and takes a deep breath through the mouth
TRUMP
Sadly folks, crooked Hillary is trying to bring me down this election cycle. Shes trying to say I worked with Putin, really great guy by the way, to win last years election. That's why I need your help. I need you, and the rest of America to come together, and make this election great. So that I can win, and keep crooked politicians like Hillary and Berney out of office! They would make a huge...
Trump suddenly gets distracted and pulls his phone out of his pocket.
TRUMP
Hehe, Megan Kelly responded to my apology tweet
TRUMP
In Megan Kelly Voice Impersonation Mr Trump I find your lewd comments, rude and offensive
Rolls eyes at camera
TRUMP
I demand you make a more formal and respectful apology, I am uphalled!
3."
Chris,"JAMES
whispering Donald, we need to get this back on track!
TRUMP
Oh, right
Trump puts the phone back into his pocket
TRUMP
And that is why I need your help to keep berney and Hillary out of office by voting me in instead. I promise, if you vote for me, I will literally buy all of your children I phone 8's. I have HUGE amounts of money because of how successful and fortunate I am! I swear if I wasn't for TRUMP brand I couldn't count a dime to my name, but I swear to God, you put my name and some god damned gold on a building, and you will be rich out of your mind
James can be seen making huge x motions with his hands
TRUMP
James why are you doing that with your hands
James walks into frame, and on set. 
JAMES
Donald, we talked about this extensively before hand. This is network television, you cant swear and say whatever the hell you want! I need you to tone it back, or were going to have to cancel this broadcast.
TRUMP
...
TRUMP
You know what James. I'm going to make you an offer.
James sighs and shakes his head in regret
JAMES
Whispers to self Oh lord what this time...
4."
Chris,"TRUMP
 James, M gonna make you an offer, here it is. I will buy your entire studio and network, and you let me run this cast how I see fit. I have a HUGE message I am trying to get to the american people James.

JAMES
You know what Donald, you do whatever the hell you want. You have infinite money, if you fuck up this broadcast, and get me in trouble with the network, I will let you handle it.

Chris,Brilliant example of how to make a great single player experience
Chris,yup
Chris,literally my main complaint is that that one semi-automatic rifle was kind of op but not super exciting to use
Chris,The carbine?
Chris,I think so
Chris,Yeah that thing was busted
Chris,yeah its was
Chris,I only use the pistol in machine gun for the first half of the game
Chris,Then shit got way too hard so I started using real guns
Chris,yeah the difficulty ramps way up in the last third or so
Chris,Now my go play Bioshock and BioShock 2 right
Chris,I should probably play those too
Chris,I bought the package all three remastered for 20 bucks
Chris,@Jed
Chris,also imo the most fun gun combo is hand cannon + that rebel shotgun that lights people on fire
Chris,That thing didn't have any ammo though
Chris,yeah they're both pretty low on ammo
Chris,I wish I'd had more money on my plate through cause then I could have got more cool upgrades
Chris,I didn't say it was practical
Chris,I think we can all agree the repeater was booty though
Chris,which one's that?
Chris,It was like the machine gun but with the less ammo in the slower rate of fire. It was a vox gun
Chris,yeah
Chris,and takes fire up to be accurate
Chris,dude the insane asylum part was spooky
Chris,when ben franklins head rolled out i paused and walked away

The demo is available to download through battle.net. It doesn't matter if you are new to the game because if we manage to get a big enough game the large number of players will balance out the more skilled players as they can be teamed against. I think this could be really fun so I hope enough of you are willing to give it a try for us to play! Confirmed players so far: Me, Sylki."

Chris,tuesday is hell tho

Chris,Ouch
Chris,yikes
Chris,6.5 hours of class spread haphazardly across 12 hours of time
Chris,HaA
Chris,Sucks for you mAtE
Chris,also what kind of whack scheduling led to this being a thing https://gyazo.com/66af9112c8a2d59d60c1de02a293ddcc

Chris,Gayms when I get home Bois hype
Chris,"two 1.5-hour segments of the same class, an hour and a half apart, in different lecture halls"
Chris,"on the flip side, for winter term (january-april) I have 7 fewer hours of class per week"
Chris,and no classes friday
Chris,seriously winter term is a joke for me https://gyazo.com/f2346dd6cd66473f5a2477a1cbe7f2a1
Chris,Gyazo
Chris,"12 hours a week, no friday classes, one online course"
Chris,Why would you get your classes so far apart?
Chris,Mine are 10 minutes apart
Chris,although for one of those I'll have to cross the campus in those 10 minutes oops
Chris,"cause these are all the only timeslots for these classes, or I used these specific ones in order to not have friday classes"
Chris,"also I like having spaced out classes, gives you time to relax and do nice things like eat or chill at the library in between"
Chris,I'd much rather have three hours of class with 3 hour gaps than three hours of straight classes with ten minute breaks and the rest of the day off
Chris,and honestly I'd put up with a lot for perpetual 3-day weekends
Chris,"which will probably translate to me doing a lot more out of town smash tournaments, especially if I can find people to carpool with -_-"
Chris,@Max how was your first day of college?
Chris,It was fine
Chris,Had to park super far away from my class
Chris,How were the classes tho
Chris,First day was just learning about the course
Chris,no real work
Chris,"oh yeah you've never had syllabus days before, have you?"
Chris,expect that for the whole first week
Chris,That's how it usually is
Chris,Whole first week?
Chris,"One of the first things my EDUC prof said to us is ""I like to cuss a lot so if that offends you please switch classes""."
Chris,yeah profs are also an interesting mixed bag
Chris,EDUC?
Chris,It is a required course where you learn about college and how to succeed in life
Chris,"also yeah for uni it's usually the first week, cause you've got your courses spread out by day (you start doing stuff in some courses but it's mostly review of previous material)"
Chris,seems like an easy A
Chris,that sounds either really useful or incredibly boring

Chris,@Sak von Sak stop playing psp and play rivals with me
Chris,"I'm not really in the mood (kinda platform fightered out, playing badly today and I'm frustrated)"
Chris,lets play a different game then
Chris,i need someone to hang out with
Chris,"housemates are already going to sleep, can't talk either way"
Chris,  
Chris,
Chris,@Mr. Airplane are you an uber driver now
Chris,no
Chris,oh lol
Chris,^
Chris,my stats prof opened our first class by just kind of playing jazz over the speakers for the first five minutes
Chris,but why
Chris,cause he's a super chill old guy
Chris,haha early classes
Chris,I already had an 830
Chris,and I have classes today until 8pm
Chris,tuesdays are hell
Chris,My mondays suck
Chris,But your tuesday seems worse than my monday
Chris,All my days are the same
Chris,I have class from 8:30-6:50
Chris,I've only got 6.5 hours total but they're spread out and I'm basically stuck on campus all day
Chris,That's the same with me
Chris,all my classes are like an hour apart
Chris,"I've got some half hour breaks, some hour and a half, some two hours, but never at convienient times to go back home until the end of the day"
Chris,You need that briefcase setup
Chris,"He just put up a slide that just says ""How not to fail STAT263 and any non-fakeable course"""
Chris,shots fired
Chris,"he just showed us his first year transcript, his highest mark is a 67 and he failed some"
Chris,what a baller
Chris,"and now he's literally going ""english.  I could fake that.  Calculus, not so much"""
Chris,his average was a 48
Chris,How did this mans become a professor?
Chris,he's telling the story of how he turned his life around
Chris,"and he actually just said ""I'm probably the only person teaching right now who had a year like this"""
Chris,"he says he's willing to print out a certificate that says ""For what it's worth, this is to certify that [YOUR NAME HERE] is, in fact, smarter than Professor Charles Arthur Molson"""
Chris,man gives no fucks
Chris,"""What I hope to hear said about me is 'Damn, that dumb son of a bitch can really teach'"""
Chris,and he's now pulling bad reviews from his own ratemyteacher page
Chris,"""if you're sleeping in my class, that's fine"""
Chris,now he's using a picture of grafitti from a queen's bathroom stall to demonstrate statistics
Chris,what a god
Chris,he's planning to use the distribution of cell phones ringing during his lectures as something we're going to study
Chris,"""When the grim reaper comes for you, you will never get these stat263 hours back"""
Chris,"""Ha! And you were wondering what scary thing to dress up as for halloween? LURKING VARIABLES"""
Chris,I figured three hours of stats every tuesday would suck but this man is great
Chris,"man has started cracking borderline dad jokes 
""Helen - the face that launched a thousand ships, and from whom we get the objective measure of beauty;  the milihelen, enough beauty to launch one ship"""
Chris,what a gOD
Chris,someone in one of my classes has the most fantasy-sounding first name I've ever seen - their name is literally Bronwyn
Chris,that is awesome
Chris,no idea if it's a guy or girl
Chris,"@Liberals Out of curiosity which of these people would be considered the most privileged, a gay white male, a straight black male, or a straight white female?"

Chris,maybe
Chris,NO
Chris,Ava how do I get gud at pay
Chris,Osu
Chris,Jk osu is for gay retards with autism
Chris,"how did you manage to mispell osu as pay?  it literally requires not only both hands to be in the wrong place, it then requires one hand to overcorrect and end up in a different wrong place"
Chris,it's only three letters
Chris,that is honestly impressive
Chris,@trap kys
Chris,osu is for cool weebs
Chris,'cool weebs' is an oxymoron
Chris,uH no
Chris,you're a weeb too sylki
Chris,did I ever profess or pretend coolness?

Chris,Sylki on on mobile
Chris,O is next to P
Chris,S is next is A
Chris,U is next to Y
Chris,Also auto correct
Chris,"the point was that o->p would put you towards the right, and u->y to the left"
Chris,but mobile autocorrect makes sense
Chris,Sylki
Chris,Can you become my basement space

Chris,Slave
Chris,To do my hw

Chris,wtf
Chris,and now its gonna take me 4 years to get the pads back on

Chris,gross
Chris,that was in my headset
Chris,please delete your headset
Chris,@Max @Trapezoider when are we gonna starcraft?
Chris,I'm good whenever
Chris,or just do something in general
Chris,I vaguely remember we played once and you actually know what you're doing so I'm gonna advocate waiting for trap before we start
Chris,thats fine
Chris,@Trapezoider
Chris,@Sak von Sak I steam messaged trap and we should be good to go when he is done with H1Z1
Chris,sounds good
Chris,What is your main race?
Chris,protoss
Chris,white
Chris,dabbled in zerg but I don't really remember most of it
Chris,I usually play Terran but I've considered swapping to Protoss
Chris,i too dabbed on zerg
Chris,my brother played terran and I vaguely remember swarms of marines and medevacs that were a bitch to deal with as protoss if I didn't have templars
Chris,that can happen
Chris,medivacs I think
Chris,"shrugs I wouldn't really know, I was just mashing medicine and evacuate together"
Chris,Evil Emperor Zurg?
Chris,Woah
Chris,also if I remember correctly the reason I ended up mostly not playing zerg was cause my brother and dad both played a lot of protoss and used mostly flying stuff that I couldn't seem to beat cause the only big zerg units could only hit ground -_-
Chris,I'm sure there's a way around that but I have no idea what
Chris,Hydralisks
Chris,Corruptors
Chris,Vipers
Chris,"everying zerg is a -lisk, you'll have to remind me what all these things ar"
Chris,are hydralisks the flapping things that shoot bouncing shots?
Chris,no
Chris,those are mutalisks
Chris,those suck at anti air
Chris,they are flying anti worker mainly
Chris,shrugs for now I'll stick to protoss
Chris,you should because if you do we will have all 3 races in our ffa
Chris,noice
Chris,diversity
Chris,Diversity is our strenght. Socialism our goal. Equality our ideal. WE ARE LIBERALS!
Chris,Yo Kameron you wanna play some Overwatch @Mr. Airplane
Chris,a little bit later
Chris,in prac rn

Chris,alright
Chris,hopefully you and trap finish around the same time

Chris,if you've got a graphing calculator
Chris,there's definately some online stuff that'll do it for you tho
Chris,My friends calculators have them
Chris,well rip I don't
Chris,"also, matrices is the plural of matrix"

Chris,this game is amazing
Chris,What platform is that game on?
Chris,ps3 and ps4
Chris,"seriously tho, the story's getting super awesome, plus I'm currently in a position gameplay-wise where I'm having to pull out all stops to try and not die and the way they're coinciding is making everything even crazier"
Chris,"goddammit I'm basically out of mana and running low on mana-replenishing items, so I'm working with my team of mostly physical attackers and the boss KEEPS CASTING A THING THAT LETS HIM REFLECT PHYSICAL ATTACKS"

I don’t know any veterans who are college aged, but if I did I would definitely tell them about the veteran’s benefits they can receive. Getting a good job is probably the most common goal for college students. Everyone with this goal should pay a visit to the CASA building to see career counselors and advisors. The CASE building is definitely a fun place to hang out and play video games!"

Chris,he had partial ownership of a goat while he was in the military and he loved it
Chris,it was his platoon's goat
Chris,Why does a platoon need a goat?
Chris,no idea
Chris,"but I vaguely remember it's a thing, at least it used to be"

Chris,be there in a second
Chris,@Rivals of Aether any1 d0wn
Chris,@Max
Chris,be there in a second
Chris,I just got home and I've got early classes so I'll pass
Chris,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/177839064/
Chris,"Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share"
Chris,"Make games, stories and interactive art with Scratch. (scratch.mit.edu)"
Chris,I am a master game dev now go try out my newest title 
Chris,@Jed This gave me a 404 error
Chris,oops
Chris,idk
Chris,Your game is broken bro
Chris,I want to plaY it
Chris,404 for you too?
Chris,Ye
Chris,What's it about
Chris,try now
Chris,works now for me
Chris,its a work in progress
Chris,did you actually make this?
Chris,yes
Chris,the jump distance seems to be inconsistent
Chris,each jump goes the same height
Chris,or did you mean the pipes?
Chris,jumps
Chris,nope each jump is 10 pixels
Chris,I still have to add a scoreboard element and a background change
Chris,Now I want to try making something
Chris,scratch is fairly easy to learn
Chris,no actual writing code
Chris,its all in blocks for you to put together
Chris,how do you get it to restart without reloading the page
Chris,the green flag
Chris,oh
Chris,I could make a start button but that would be too much work
Chris,l a z y
Chris,wow this game is very hard
Chris,its flappy bird
Chris,but memes
Chris,i am aware
Chris,so my exam schedule just came out
Chris,I didn't quite pay attention to which of my classes do and don't have exams
Chris,"but as it turns out, I only have one exam"
Chris,so that worked out well
Chris,@Sak von Sak play rivals with me
Chris,"in a bit, studying for a midterm atm"
Chris,I will tho
Chris,get in here jed
Chris,ya big nerd
Chris,@Max play the ow halloweeb event with us we need a fourth
Chris,doing homework
Chris,@Sak von Sak nice name
Chris,cheers
Chris,I figured I'd go with the theme
Chris,but now that you're not supply depot anymore we need another supply depot
Chris,I'm back to that
Chris,yee
Chris,lol
Chris,@here ayy you guys wanna play some cs?
Chris,maybe yesterday
Chris,"gotta study and eat, but maybe later tonight"
Chris,I'm checking out dust_new
Chris,wanna queue with me?
Chris,instead of checking out dust new
Chris,Later maybe
Chris,I might play
Chris,In like a while
Chris,RIP my awesome winter term schedule
Chris,"dropped one of my courses for this term, replaced it with a different one next term (that everyone says is easier and the prof's not an ass, and where I can take either for my degree), and now I've lost my super easy schedule and no friday classes"
Chris,Rip
Chris,"on the flip side, at least this term should be manageable"
Chris,cause that one course was occupying like half my time and I was doing terribly
Chris,and I'd already gotten in a mini-fight with the prof
Chris,Yeah that's no good
Chris,What class is this?
Chris,"digital systems, it's basically agressive circuitry and the nuts and bolts of how computers are put together"
Chris,which should be super interesting
Chris,I agree
Chris,"but the prof subscribes to this ""innovative"" teaching model which is really good in theory - the dry lecture learning stuff is done outside of class, then class time is for application of what you've learned and you can ask questions and stuff really easily"
Chris,the problem is that he kinda forgot about the whole applying stuff in class part
Chris,"so it's pretty hard to make sense of anything cause a) first class after readings is a test on the readings without an opportunity to ask about anything you're confused about, then in between that and the other class of the week there's an ""in-class assignment"" which isn't done in class, and he doesn't reply to email questions about it so you still don't really know what you're doing for it, then the second class he takes up the test and stumbles around trying to answer questions about the actual content we're confused about"
Chris,"on top of which, there's labs every couple of weeks, which are even more complicated, and by terrible scheduling, I have other lectures during almost all the open lab sections where you can show up and work with the TAs to get stuff done (the only one that I can show up to I can only show up to half an hour of it, which isn't enough), and the software we have to work on is super buggy on my computer and periodically just freezes and deletes whatever project I was working on if I kill it with task manager"
Chris,"and when I asked him for an evening-long extention in light of this (was due at 4pm, but there was an open lab for it from 5-7 that night which I could go to), not only did he not give an extention, he also just gives instant zero to a late submission"
Chris,and that was going to happen pretty much every lab
Chris,so we got into a bit of an argument about that
Chris,this is also the course where everyone is slowly bailing
Chris,"I started out in a 5-person group, two people dropped, he mashed the remaining three together with two other groups so we then had an 8-person group, which has now dwindled to a 5-person group (4 now that I've dropped)"
Chris,"td;dr - cool sounding course, prof butchered any reasonable chance of understanding it and is also stupidly rigid in how he handles things, about half the class has dropped and I'm incredibly happy to be part of that half"
Chris,Sounds like hell
Chris,Meanwhile I am sitting here trying to be productive during my unexpected 1 hour break by writing out code on my phone
Chris,
Chris,you really need a laptop
Chris,Check it out
Chris,I really do
Chris,This is kind of painful
Chris,I can imagine
Chris,but seriously how are you doing the whole uni thing without a laptop?
Chris,are you taking notes by hand?
Chris,Yeah
Chris,It's not too bad
Chris,It just sucks when I have these breaks
Chris,"get a cheap laptop, do work during breaks"
Chris,I spend most of my breaks off the corner of one of the libraries doing assignments or studying
Chris,it's honestly really good for productivity
Chris,you can probably get a laptop that does what you need for a couple hundred bucks at most
Chris,somewhat related but Android studio makes me want to rip my toenails out
Chris,@Sak von Sak I approve the switch back to your old (and obviously superior) profile picture
Chris,eh I like them both but this one shows better in the discord bubble
Chris,@Rivals of Aether games?
Chris,I'm in
Chris,Girls can now join the boy scouts
Chris,...
Chris,Yup
Chris,I happen to remember something called the girl scouts existing so this seems pointless
Chris,Girl scouts leadership ran it into the ground
Chris,@Rivals of Aether games?
Chris,in a few minutes
Chris,"well rip me, 2-0'd one of my melee demons only to immediately lose my next two matches and not even make top 8"
Chris,"on the flip side, my record against sasquatch is now 3-15"
Chris,a marked improvement
Chris,also I had a weird run through like all the people I usually fight
Chris,"please let me fight someone other than sasquatch, dayman, and milk"
Chris,I almost always fight two or more of them per tournament
Chris,3/4 tournaments I've fought dayman and at least one of milk or sasquatch
Chris,holy shit one of the compsci academic advisers here is named Erin Gunsinger and that might be the most badass name I've ever heard
Chris,oh snap
Chris,thats lit
Chris,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Chris,COLLEGE APP DUE TOMORROW YOU FOOL
Chris,don't worry about it i believe in doing everything at the literal last second
Chris,SCREW YOU
Chris,@games here?

Chris,im down later
Chris,@Jed gamezzz?
Chris,@Mr. Airplane overwatch
Chris,did you deafen me fusion?
Chris,I got through the entire starcraft brood war soundtrack (47:50) 3 and a half times while doing homework. Why must it be so long.
Chris,are Koth maps bo3 now ? in comp ?
Chris,indeed my dude

Chris,SOON
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,LEAVE ME ALONE
Chris,@Sak von Sak sleep is for the week
Chris,@Sak von Sak would you rather sleep or watch anime i already know its watch anime to comoooon
Chris,grumble
Chris,what would we watc
Chris,"black clover, my hero academia, monster"
Chris,I've already watched like all of mha
Chris,at least all that's dubbed
Chris,"ew Sylki, you refuse to watch subbed even if thats all there is ? ? ?"
Chris,no that's not what I said
Chris,I've watched a lot of things that have only sub
Chris,sounds like it
Chris,and a lot of subs for stuff where I didn't like the dub
Chris,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Chris, An error occurred: Error: socket hang up
Chris,"also ava just to clarify that discussion cause I wasn't paying a ton of attention (and was also like half asleep), MHA has simultaneous sub and dub, the dub is really good but delayed by about a week, which I'm willing to wait"
Chris,o h  I see
Chris,Is being straight kinda gay
Chris,i mean think about it
Chris,you're into someone who sucks dick
Chris,@Sak von Sak rivals in 30?
Chris,Yes
Chris,eh sure
Chris,we could do a 4 man tourney if @Max is down
Chris,yee
Chris,@Max you down my dude?
Chris,octagon why
Chris,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chris,I can't tell if you just did that as a counterpoint to my name or if you're carefully avoiding Zack Attack
Chris,Doing school reading. We'll see if i can play or not.
Chris,the world may never know
Chris,people only play ori now and its annoying as hell
Chris,ori's kinda broke
Chris,and easier rushdown than wrastor
Chris,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Chris,"kk, gonna make a bathroom run first"
Chris,Can't sorry busy with school work
Chris,just play anyways
Chris,read while playing=profit
Chris,do school later
Chris,no
Chris,ez
Chris,
Chris,also if we do a tourney you can play during offtime
Chris,@Max doki doki literature club?????
Chris,what?
Chris,it says you're playing it
Chris,It's more important than his schoolwork
Chris,I just finished my school work
Chris,then join us my dude
Chris,eh
Chris,mini tourney
Chris,I only have like 25-30 minutes of free time before I need to start on more school
Chris,that's enough time
Chris,ye
Chris,Ava's comments on this game make me want to continue
Chris,we wanna see where everyone stands in skill rn
Chris,and octagon's like good at this game now
Chris,keeping it close with me in kragg dittos
Chris,I know I've played him a lot
Chris,come on you can play it whenever
Chris,Also I'll lose because you are all warm and my first 5 or so games I suck
Chris,wrastor is hard man
Chris,we'll open with round robin
Chris,"and then top two play for 1st, bottom two play for 3rd"
Chris,Another time
Chris,bruh
Chris,I don't feel up to it right now
Chris,and I know it will take longer than I have
Chris,30 MINUTES HUH
Chris,dear friendo
Chris,if you don't want to play with us
Chris,just say so
Chris,don't make them excuses
Chris,Miraculous Youngster is a beast ow team

Chris,"@Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane I started my assignment at 11:00 which is almost exactly 30 minutes after I sent my message. I do not lie and I did indeed have a school assignment to do. After I finished it, you guys were playing csgo which I had no interest in therefore I didn't feel the need to say anything about finishing. I don't make things up or lie. If I simply didn't want to play I would have said so, like I do whenever Overwatch is suggested. In those cases I'm sure you can remember many ""no I don't want to""'s. If you want I can even screenshot my ceritficate of completion of the assignment that I am emailed if you do not believe me."
Chris, best emote
Chris,
Chris,"K fair @Max, you can understand our assumption tho"
Chris,"Yeah I understand, I just wanted to clarify my innocence."
Chris,Idk still seems shday to me
Chris,"on an unrelated note, who's down to do a 5-queue with our names as Zack Attack, Zack Defense, Zack Sp. Attack, Zack Sp. Defense, and Zack Speed? @Cs:go"
Chris,"not now, but like, tonight some time"
Chris,I call Zack Speed
Chris,Yee
Chris,also I have more work tonight so maybe not
Chris,we'll see
Chris,I'm doing math now but I have a paper later
Chris,we'll see I guess
Chris,try to get as much done as you can
Chris,btw I'm going to be carving my profile picture into a pumpkin for halloween
Chris,the terran crest?
Chris,yes
Chris,that's pretty sweet
Chris,Its probably my favorite faction logo of all time
Chris,"all the sc ones are pretty sick, personally I prefer the protoss one"
Chris,go figure
Chris,its also cool
Chris,"I'm also pretty partial to the persona 5 player faction/crew logo, though it's not the kind of thing you can engrave on a pumpkin, at least not easily"
Chris,thats in interesting one
Chris,it's also kinda weird cause you don't actually get a character who wears a hat until pretty late in the game
Chris,and it's not even really a top hat
Chris,@Sak von Sak  I just started doki doki and i'm so on edge because the only thing i've heard about it is what you put in the memes channel
Chris,lol
Chris,I haven't gotten far enough for anything to actually happen either
Chris,but I'm terrified of everything
Chris,Its quite an experience
Chris,and there's this tiny part of me that thinks it might all just be a huge meme and it's actually a totally normal story and they just got everyone to say it goes hard in the psychological horror
Chris,which would be really funny
Chris,but I'm hoping that doesn't happen
Chris,
Chris,oh dang I have to write a poem?
Chris,yup
Chris,it doesn't have to make sense
Chris,just do what I did and choose your favourite word from each page and see where it ends you up
Chris,or be super tactical and choose the ones you think will impress your future waifu(?)
Chris,you guys gotta pick words to please a specific girl!!
Chris,^ was about to say that
Chris,yea
Chris,WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBS
Chris,"yeah I noticed, but they jump when I pick darker words"
Chris,I picked based that way and 16/20 seemed to make the purple hair girl happy so.... shrugs
Chris,
Chris,I think they jump for the stuff they like
Chris,yes
Chris,
Chris,THATS STILL SPOOKY
Chris,also I've barely gotten past the poem bit so don't say anything that happens after that
Chris,got it
Chris,"except maybe who ended up the happiest from your poem, cause curiosity"
Chris,spoiler-free catholic discord
Chris,yeah I wanna know too :0
Chris,whoever you choose the most words for you spend the day with at the club before reading poems
Chris,well obviously i'm going for yuri because she's best girl
Chris,nO
Chris,ew
Chris,Natsuki > Sayori > Yuri
Chris,wow
Chris,i guess it's ok to be wrong
Chris,Sayori > Natsuki > Yuri
Chris,Natsuki is a weeb and a tsundere ! ! Tsunderes are funny characters
Chris,natsuki is trash
Chris,Yuri is trash
Chris,no u
Chris,chill
Chris,in the small portion I've played I'm gonna have to agree with smithy here
Chris,oh boy
Chris,aaAAAAA
Chris,not necessarily on the best girl part cause I'm not far enough to have an opinion on that yet
Chris,but on the fact that natsuki seems annoying
Chris,shes funny imo
Chris,shrug
Chris,I don;t like tsunderes
Chris,"the general archetype works fine, it's just when it's played totally straight that it's annoying"
Chris,"you can either use it as a small part of the character (see: kurisu in steins gate), or blow it wildly out of proportion for comedic purposes (see: nichijou)"
Chris,"wait, who's the tsundere in nichijou?"
Chris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQq5d6v59xg
Chris,Nichijou - Clean Up
Chris,Nichijou - Clean Up Scene from Episode 18 Episode 18: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pj5IoTz_cU&list=PLosfF8MlHstRb3DaUmdL5iIhdTf2A0w7I
Chris,oh right I totally forgot about her lol
Chris,literally the most tsundere character I've ever seen
Chris,welp
Chris,"in an epic lack of proper group communication (my fault as well), two separate group members each did about half of the project"
Chris,now we're gonna have to compare and see whose stuff to keep
Chris,You mean you split into 2 teams and each did the same half?
Chris,naw we just figured we'd get started on it before discussing it with the group (I didn't bother telling them cause they didn't start early last time and I just dropped a 2/3 finished project on them and said do the rest and that worked out just fine)
Chris,but we both decided to start and not tell anyone
Chris,oh okay
Chris,Mine would have been funnier
Chris,and cause it's programming it's entirely possible that even if we did exactly opposite halves we won't be able to just mush them together
Chris,well it does look like we did nearly opposite halves
Chris,so at least it'll be easier than if we'd both done totally different parts
Chris,"@Rivals of Aether My opinions on each characters worst matchup                                                  Wrastor>Maypul
Zetterburn>Wrastor
Absa>Kragg
Etalus>Zetterburn
Orcane>Etalus
Kragg>Orcane
Zetterburn>Absa
No apparent counter>Forsburn"
Chris,btw Good in matchup>Character being countered
Chris,not sure about the kragg > orcane thing
Chris,In my experience it is true because he can power through bubbles
Chris,his only way to power through bubbles is sideb
Chris,which is really easy to counter
Chris,thats enough
Chris,you can get through and immediately put yourself in a terrible position
Chris,worst matchup does not mean bad
Chris,its cause max always beats me in that matchup 
Chris,I don't think orcane has any matchups that are very bad at all
Chris,altought i agree that kragg counters orcane for the following reasons
Chris,all of his moves slightly outrange or outprioritize orcanes options
Chris,"I feel like zetter, absa do better against orcane"
Chris,orcanes biggest strength is edgegarding and kragg cant be edgeguarded
Chris,you can't out-camp absa with bubbles
Chris,orcane beats both of them imo
Chris,the weight matchup is wierd
Chris,rocks>bubbles
Chris,and I dunno if zetter's actually good but I randomly pulled my half-decent zetter and beat kameron
Chris,if you get hit by kragg as orcane you're pretty much dead
Chris,eh only if he's got the right setups in place
Chris,like only if I can bully you offstage into rock rock rock rock
Chris,Kragg gets huge punishes of almost everything
Chris,^
Chris,you just have not figured it out yet
Chris,yes but I feel like he blows at getting in
Chris,his biggest weakness is his approach sucks
Chris,i kinda disagree
Chris,eh
Chris,His approach is fine
Chris,my defense on orcane is just good
Chris,speaking of rivals anyone wanna play
Chris,im down after dinner
Chris,I'm down
Chris,lol maybe in a little bit
Chris,4 man tourney les go bois
Chris,maybe we'll get that 4-man tourney going
Chris,surprised one challenged my forsburn statement
Chris,i have to do it soonish tho
Chris,none of us know forsburn
Chris,^
Chris,i think he gets countered by iceguy
Chris,he can combo etalus really well but maybe
Chris,"generally speaking though, my general reasoning for why kragg >>> orcane doesn't entirely hold up is just from fighting kameron a ton, going more or less even with my kragg and then doing about the same with my worse characters"
Chris,which doesn't quite make sense
Chris,you put orcane >>> etalus and my etalus usually does alright
Chris,Kameron plays against 3 Kragg players and is just good at the matchup
Chris,well i have tons of practice against kragg
Chris,fair
Chris,also yeah we have all kind of gravitated over to the rock beetle
Chris,I'm going to make a more detailed ROA stats/opinions list shortly
Chris,also I've gotta say I love octagon's kragg
Chris,it's got the same dumb reads I get only more
Chris,although as soon as I started reading his reads things went downhill
Chris,cause he goes for the same reads a lot
Chris,ill be there at 7 and then we can do a 4 man tourney
Chris,@Sak von Sak GET IN HERE BOIIII
Chris,finishing a bagel then I'm in
Chris,@Sak von Sak how long does it take to eat a bagel?
Chris,long time
Chris,is actually several bagels
Chris,with a bunch of stuff on them
Chris,"I just got my first ""ending"" and I don't know how I feel"
Chris,"good job, queen's 
http://www.cp24.com/news/330-charges-laid-33-arrested-during-homecoming-at-queen-s-university-1.3634572"
Chris,"330 charges laid, 33 arrested during homecoming at Queen's University"
Chris,"Police say they laid hundreds of charges during Queen's University homecoming celebrations in Kingston, Ont., over the weekend."
Chris,"and I'm assuming one of those would involve one the brother of one of my housemates, who got stabbed in the face"
Chris,"(he's fine, more or less, but he'll probably have a scar)"
Chris,good old homecoming
Chris,props on them for doubling the numbers
Chris,on them?
Chris,to them?
Chris,I think 'to them'
Chris,^
Chris,yeah
Chris,unfortunatley I care not enough to fix my bad grammar
Chris,@Sak von Sak friendlies?
Chris,sure
Chris,get in here nerd
Chris,"sec, bathrooming first"
Chris,"This is very important
Some guy on our team was 1-13 and we're like ""Darius you're shit at this game""
AND THIS MAN GOES ""Oh yeah well i can speak 2 languages"""
Chris,"like good for you, you still suck ass at league dont play ranked"
Chris,Gottem
Chris,Welp today's the day we get new rivals characters and I've got lectures and meetings till 930 and a few tests to study for
Chris,rip
Chris,I actually have my first class off
Chris,So I'm testing the new characters right now
Chris,Clairen is super fun
Chris,Ranno as seems fun
Chris,general playstles?
Chris,Clairen looks like she will be a all around character. Her neutral and punishes both look good. Ranno looks to be a powerhouse on stage that will be easily gimped.
Chris,first impressions
Chris,I have a feeling there is going to be at least 1 character (I'm thinking absa at the moment) who is going to do AWEFUL against Clairen.
Chris,do either of them have the nice movement à la zetterburn?
Chris,"mostly clairen, I enjoy not getting gimped a ton so I feel like I'll probably like her more"
Chris,Froggy boi seems op
Chris,"all in all, we need more non-kragg mains in this discord so maybe this will help"
Chris,Yeah I'ma get the dlc
Chris,"we basically have two and a half kraggs, one and a half orcanes, and a wrastor"
Chris,I'm kinda an everything

Chris,"maybe I'll adjust down to just two kraggs - me, kinda you, kinda max"
Chris,@Rivals of Aether If anyone wants to help me test Ranno and Clairen just @me.

Chris,he really shouldnt go
Chris,i just wish pewpewu got the w
Chris,what about the eight foxes (and m2k's kind of a fox)
Chris,that's literally half the summit

Fox - 8
Falco - 1
Marth - 1
Sheik - 3
Puff - 1
Peach - 1
Falcon - 2
Luigi - 1
Yoshi - 1"
Chris,the best part is that a fox probably wont win
Chris,unless you count armada
Chris,which I did
Chris,the real dream is amsa winning
Chris,no
Chris,"the highest paying tourney, ever"
Chris,m2k winning is the dream
Chris,"just, surprise yoshi wins"
Chris,"rough order of what I want to see: Amsa, Plup, Hax, Blea Gelo, S2J, Axe"
Chris,pulpW

Chris,it's only been like 25 minutes
Chris,I'm torn between finishing this and not
Chris,cause it's so good
Chris,but I'm so full
Chris,and it's so salty
Chris,what is it?
Chris,there's like no moisture left in my mouth
Chris,I made the most badass sandwich
Chris,"i say, toss it in da trash"
Chris,and come play with me
Chris,"I cooked a bunch of beef and mushrooms in garlic butter, those + turkey + boursin on a pretzel bun"
Chris,unbelievably good

Chris,Bout why we have a league channel
Chris,I think foosion still plays every now and then
Chris,But with who?
Chris,inappropriate name
Chris,actually his name
Chris,oh yeah I've seen him a few times

Chris,@Max

Chris,christ this is depressing https://compete.kotaku.com/worlds-best-smash-4-player-is-worn-down-by-haters-and-h-1819677035
Chris,World's Best Smash 4 Player Is Worn Down By Haters And Harassment
Chris,"For 13 minutes, Gonzalo “Zero” Barrios’ face barely moved. It was the Grand Finals match of a Super Smash Bros. Wii U tournament, and Barrios, the best Smash player in the world, was squaring off against a formidable opponent. A few feet away, Barrios’ bodyguard kept a lookout for a man who’d threatened to be there, in wait, with a gun aimed at the champion gamer."
Chris,@Mr. Airplane Someone asked me to tutor them how much should I charge?
Chris,"I don't know what a reasonable amount is, but make sure you start by asking what they'd be willing to pay first, in case it's way more than what you were gonna ask for"
Chris,also depends on what you're doing
Chris,i charge people $5 to look at their completed code if it doesnt work and i fix it
Chris,one guy literally just forgot to indent something
Chris,i hit the tab key once and got $5
Chris,but if its something more important and difficult like physics definetly raise ur price
Chris,also little haggling tip if they tell you to make an offer always ask more than you want
Chris,that way when you lower your price to what you want they feel like they're getting a deal
Chris,@Rivals of Aether games?
Chris,@Max
Chris,What is it?
Chris,@Jed
Chris,rivals?
Chris,not until my rehabilitation (spelling?) is complete
Chris,oh
Chris,@Sak von Sak play some RoA with me my dude

Chris,@Max I now am able to accept the rivals skill gap as you have 198 hours compared to my 39
Chris,well I got to my first ending in doki doki literature club
Chris,conclusion - should not have done this right before going to bed
Chris,What did you think of the game?
Chris,also did you see the title screen after finishing
Chris,Yup
Chris,Title screen was fucked
Chris,I  don't really consider that me finishing the game
Chris,I'm not letting it end like that
Chris,yeah you gotta play more
Chris,it only gets better from here
Chris,canada cup's looking pretty damn good
Chris,"we've already got armada, leffen, m2k signed up"
Chris,why do we need blea gelo at summit when the best luigi in the world is already attending
Chris,because the best luigi in the world doesn't play luigi

Chris,and hella salty
Chris,I just did worse than I ever have at a kingston tournament
Chris,and then proceeded to play like two hours of salty fox dittos
Chris,I have reached an impressive level of simmering anger at this point
Chris,nah just do it
Chris,play me fool
Chris,I GOT 17TH
Chris,I DID WORSE THAN SENDO
Chris,AND I LOST TO BUCKTOWN
Chris,yeah but you can get first in the 1v1 against me in rivals
Chris,AND QUINCY

Chris,ecksdee
Chris,still pretty annoyed because I'm usually super consistent and I just played like ass today
Chris,and there's a monthly tomorrow and my confidence has gone down the drain
Chris,"lololol I was on commentary for a bit on the stream, I watched a bit and due to our shitty mic it sounds like I have some super weird accent that's a blend of like scottish and australian"
Chris,@Rotomotorz do you want to do 5 tp mission
Chris,i already did
Chris,@everyone Sylki and I are currently hosting a creative writing project. In this project we are going to be agreeing on a basic story premise and taking turns writing chapters after that. We already have 4 people and are looking for 1 more so please PM me if you're interested. We are looking to make a serious story so if you plan on meming your way through it don't bother signing up.
Chris,"Sylki, that's just how you sound normally"
Chris,What do you mean?
Chris,look up a couple of messages
Chris,I was replying to his earlier statement
Chris,"also, I did better at the monthly (waaaay more stacked) than the weekly -_-"
Chris,wait the pyro has a jetpack now\
Chris,ok
Chris,It's shit
Chris,It's really really bad
Chris,okay but like
Chris,still
Chris,I've been playing all of yesterday and today
Chris,@Max I met a good wrastor
Chris,"welp at the monthly, top 8 was initially 5/8 kingston people, and now we've reached top 3 and it's just the out of town people"
Chris,"also top two seeds from my pool both made top eight, backing up my claim that I got the hardest pool"
Chris,"except maybe the ryan ford, sandman, sasquatch pool"
Chris,that one was pretty viscious
Chris,@everyone I need a new headset anyone have any legit suggestions
Chris,"I've got a razer kraken, it's pretty good"
Chris,thats what i got right now
Chris,i was gonna get another one unless i got a better suggestion

Chris,ok fine later
Chris,@Max what were you gonna say my dude
Chris,I was going to say you should know not to disturb those in the literature club
Chris,im guessing you dont want to play rivals
Chris,Hyperx cloud 2's
Chris,MAX YOU'RE SCARING ME
Chris,why?
Chris,I just meant that most people playing DDLC don't want to stop because they want to see what happens
Chris,this game's scary enough without slightly suspect phrasing outside it too
Chris,@Jed fite me
Chris,no
Chris,@Max i downloaded starcraft
Chris,"Doing something, I'll be there soon"
Chris,not too soon though
Chris,Sylki and I can teach you
Chris,I barely get what I'm doing

Chris,Lots of quotes tonight eh?

Chris,more like
Chris,test proctor
Chris,gottem
Chris,rekeronied
Chris,@Rivals of Aether I beat someone on the ladder who had around 1200 rank points!
Chris,Noice
Chris,"My group for one of my classes is writing a report, one section is on ""issues and lessons learned"", and one thing that happened was we asked our assigned TA - a guy named Hang - for help and advice on part of our presentation (which was a required thing) and he didn't get back to us for like a week, literally until the evening before the presentation and after we'd handed in the slides and couldn't change them anymore.  We're having a dilemma on whether we should phrase that problem as ""he left us Hanging."""
Chris,Fucking Hang
Chris,he was actually super nice
Chris,"but at the same time, he'd better be given that he left us hanging for a week and we ended up handing in slides with a few major mistakes"
Chris,"also, high quality google docs recognizes all of these names except one"
Chris,how does it recognize Sandarusi but not Mallany?
Chris,the glock is better than the deagle because it has more bullets
Chris,Is that why the zeus is the worst weapon
Chris,
Chris,yeah
Chris,thats why you never buy armour
Chris,it has 0 bullets
Chris,True
Chris,Yo
Chris,You wanna help me code
Chris,Tru
Chris,no
Chris,Go away Jed
Chris,gottem
Chris,what do you need help with?
Chris,"""I don't see why you have such a huge problem with this, it's super common""
""So was the plague."""
Chris,I am making a timer thingy
Chris,in what language tho
Chris,processing
Chris,
Chris,xd
Chris,i would help but i gotta do college apps
Chris,@Sak von Sak help doctor
Chris,You baited me
Chris,but i said no tho
Chris,Baited
Chris,I'm writing a report atm
Chris,big group thing
Chris,Double baited
Chris,can help him later tho
Chris,never used processing tho
Chris,The logic of the code still applies
Chris,chudat fox
Chris,ez
Chris,vs m2k ganon
Chris,Woah
Chris,ye that actually happened
Chris,AND NOW ITS MANGO MARIO VS AXE YUNG LINK
Chris,Of all the days to have a 5-hour group meeting and then go to the gym
Chris,Sounds like I'm missing some hype stuff
Chris,axe op
Chris,why is he sticking to falco
Chris,i dunno
Chris,oh
Chris,nvm
Chris,lets go
Chris,monkaS
Chris,oh

Chris,that sopo is spicy
Chris,ye boi
Chris,rip chu
Chris,@Jed
Chris,happy birthday tomorrow bro
Chris,Update your steam wish llist
Chris,FeelsBirthdayMan
Chris,
Chris,Happy 17
Chris,but for real update that wishlist boiiii
Chris,I do not require games
Chris,this match is nuts
Chris,I've been thinking and I think its possible we will have more fun at a meetup if we don't go to an event. Does anyone else think this may be the case?
Chris,"the meetup might be more fun, but if I'm paying for travel and a hotel I'd prefer to get both that and an event out of it"
Chris,if we need to schedule it so that we can all come and it doesn't line up with an event I'm fine with that too
Chris,im kinda with max on this one
Chris,but an event would be fun tho
Chris,would it have to be an event with melee tho?
Chris,probably since that is the only game that enough of us play
Chris,also the only game we could enter as well as spectate
Chris,Someone could bring their laptop for rivals?
Chris,I could
Chris,I'm sure someone else could as well for multiple setups
Chris,That's be dope
Chris,Idk if I can come though
Chris,i could prolly run roa on my surface XD
Chris,I could bring mine
Chris,but me being able to go is gonna depend on a whole bunch of stuff
Chris,I'd need to get an internship over the summer and be able to take some time off
Chris,Depends on the price for me
Chris,well we should try to make it happen bois
Chris,we've been planning something like this for 1.5 years now
Chris,agreed
Chris,Yeah I'm saving up to move out though so I have to decide if I'm willing to spend
Chris,And set myself back
Chris,to move out???
Chris,why would you move out
Chris,I'll be 18 in a yeat
Chris,yeah but why would you want to move out
Chris,I'm ready to be independent
Chris,you've got a free home w/ utilities and food and everything
Chris,Yes
Chris,its not ideal but it is super practical
Chris,I mean basically I get rekt if my parents find out
Chris,So if that happens leaving will be necessary
Chris,it's something you should take advantage of until you have a consistent source of money that can cover your rent and food and utilities
Chris,Thats called addiction folks
Chris,Willing to alter your life for a substance
Chris,No
Chris,That's one reason
Chris,also that's not the definition of addiction by a long shot
Chris,^
Chris,addiction is defined by a physical and mental dependance on a substance
Chris,I'm aware thats not the definition
Chris,If I get a roommate or 2 I could cover rent rn
Chris,I'm just ready to be on my own
Chris,"also, just a recommendation, don't just drop this on your family out of the blue"
Chris,Idk my family is great and I love them
Chris,so tell them
Chris,don't make it a surprise
Chris,I will
Chris,or they'll be incredibly pissed
Chris,OR just dont and stay with them
Chris,Breaks over boiz
Chris,breaks?
Chris,I'm loving how all the dreamhack trophies are breaking
Chris,did Hbox's break?
Chris,someone's buying cheap trophies
Chris,yeah
Chris,the base came off
Chris,lol
Chris,https://twitter.com/LiquidHbox/status/922288824620695553
Chris,sigh
Chris,also do you guys think hbox is #1 in world rn?
Chris,yes
Chris,me too
Chris,yeah he's going pretty ham
Chris,also s2j definitely top 10 at this point
Chris,even though I think he's boring
Chris,but do I really wanna play doki doki
Chris,also @Mr. Airplane I was on break at work
Chris,Play it
Chris,Play it
Chris,@The Rona How far are you?
Chris,This is a fun game
Chris,Yuri is coming over to my house today
Chris,hawt
Chris,❤
Chris,I chose Natsuki
Chris,Ew
Chris,We got to make cupcakes
Chris,so this is a dating sim?
Chris,it looks like one but it really isn't
Chris,its a psychological horror game
Chris,It needs to be played blind so don't look up stuff about it
Chris,is it a sound based game?
Chris,smell?
Chris,its a visual novel
Chris,do I need to provide my own blindfold?
Chris,how do I play a visual novel blind?
Chris,bad game design imo
Chris,you really don't need to take that out of context
Chris,yeah
Chris,but it was funny
Chris,btw @The Rona I only chose Natsuki because Sayori wasn't an option. She was my favorite.
Chris,why the heck is everyone so obsessed with Yuri
Chris,shes dumb
Chris,I'm not sure
Chris,Once everyone has completed the game I'm going to make a poll
Chris,Yo I read a book with Yuri ok
Chris,best girl poll?
Chris,She liked my poem
Chris,You do things with whichever girl liked your poem
Chris,So if a different one had you would have done something with her
Chris,shhhhhhhh
Chris,Maybe
Chris,not maybe its a fact
Chris,I wanted Monika but then I realised that she wasn't an option
Chris,;-;
Chris,lol
Chris,@Rivals of Aether someone fight me real quick
Chris,Fuck me this game
Chris,Oh poor doctor
Chris,You ain't seen nothing yet
Chris,how long is the game?
Chris,This just got super weird
Chris,It's a few hours

Chris,Happy birthday!!  @Jed
Chris,they grow up so fast 
Chris,Can it be considered growing up when Kameron's testosterone levels stay negative every year
Chris,"so for a big group project, we have do peer reviews where we basically give all our group members marks based on how good they were, and we have to write a paragraph or so for each of them explaining why we gave those marks"
Chris,which is a pain
Chris,but at least the sample paragraphs are hilarious
Chris,here are a few samples:
Chris,"""Candorsnaffity Hixelbröd was an annoying teammate"""
Chris,"""he agreed that he'd do the sushi-ionization module by Sunday afternoon"""
Chris,"""Prosnitau Sgrachita de la Mnirhoihoi was good, helpful and co-operative."""
Chris,"""V'snl'chm'tkn!k of the Fortress of Doom (that's me) was an effective worker in this
assignment"""
Chris,"also I just skimmed over the way you're supposed to break down marks (that I totally ignored initially), which contains this gem: A mark of seven indicates someone who leaps tall buildings in a single bound, walks on water, and solves NP-complete problems in linear time."
Chris,@here gamerinos anyone???
Chris,Yee
Chris,@Sak von Sak play dem games with me and birthday boi
Chris,@Max you too
Chris,gotta finish these stupid peer reviews
Chris,just do it later
Chris,boom problem solved
Chris,it's due tonight
Chris,I already left it to the last minute
Chris,Doki Doki is okie doki
Chris,     
Chris,same
Chris,"My stats prof: ""Just then, you assumed that I was telling the truth, because what I was saying was plausible.  Just like how you assume I have the credentials to teach this course."""
Chris,Same
Chris,The teachers are on strike where I live and i am not getting compensation for the missed school even though i paid for it if you guys can take like 1 minutes jsut to fill out this petition giving students compensation for missed days i will personally suck your dick and give you a high five at the same time https://www.change.org/p/college-employer-council-students-demand-a-tuition-refund-for-each-day-missed-in-case-of-an-ontario-college-strike/nftexp/ex15/v6/818679301?recruiter=818679301&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial.combo_new_control_progress_bar&utm_content=ex15%3Av6
Chris,Sign the Petition
Chris,College Employer Council: Students demand a tuition refund for each day missed in case of an Ontario college strike
Chris,damn they're on strike again?
Chris,"not as sure about college profs, but for uni and high school they have an insanely good setup"
Chris,"as in high pay, low hours, good benefits"
Chris,and they still strike
Chris,"the people a year older than me got screwed for uni applications cause the public school board teachers aren't legally allowed to strike, so the union just strongarmed all the teachers into stopping extracurriculars so basically everyone who was applying to post-secondary stuff had a big empty extracurricular section on all their applications"
Chris,the worst part is that most teachers didn't even want to do it but you can't teach in a public school without being part of the union so they had no choice
Chris,and the union's pretty screwed up even when no one's going on strike
Chris,"one of the major things is that your ability to get placed where you want is based 100% on seniority, so if you're an awful teacher who's been around for 30 years you can teach what you want, where you want, and if you're a brand new teacher living paycheck to paycheck you probably can't even get a job"
Chris,"one of my uncles has been a teacher for six years, he couldn't get a job for the first three years except as a substitute teacher or an LTO (long term occasional, basically if a teacher goes on maternity or sick leave for awhile he would come in and pick up a poorly documented class for a few months then he'd be out of a job again), then he got a really good slot for a year.... only to get kicked out by someone with more seniority and he had to spend the next two years at a place for kids who've been expelled or are in juvie but can't technically not get school (read: everyone's an asshole and/or doesn't give a fuck and it's in the middle of a super dangerous area) before he's finally managed to get a decent placement and who knows how long that's gonna last, cause based on their system by the end of the year he'll only have 4 years of seniority"
Chris,Teachers unions are just terrible
Chris,Looks like we agree on one more thing
Chris,"some unions are alright, especially in dangerous jobs (like factory work), but a) unions in public funded areas are generally terrible cause they're fairly essential services where it has a large, negative impact on society if and when they strike, b) teachers already have a pretty damn cushy gig and really, really don't need a union, and c) this union in particular has a tendancy to kinda sorta work against the best interests of its members in an attempt to make things marginally better for a small handful of them"
Chris,holy shit
Chris,I leave this chat for a couple weeks and come back to find deep discussion on politics
Chris,nice
Chris,Welcome back
Chris,hey boys
Chris,yee
Chris,@Max

Chris,Its going good
Chris,Is there a new build I could play tonight?
Chris,ooh ooh play with me later
Chris,I was planning on patching it soon
Chris,maybe I can get the new build together today
Chris,yes @Sak von Sak
Chris,I can't now tho
Chris,just took an hour-long melee break
Chris,and I've got a midterm at 7
Chris,is anyone here getting destiny 2? It looks kinda gay but im down if you guys get it
Chris,oh
Chris,rip
Chris,how difficult are exams?
Chris,also @Max @Sak von Sak college life is crazy
Chris,gotta love it though
Chris,I just took a midterm and it was pretty easy
Chris,"I'm not that worried, I've done a ton of old midterms and I basically know every questions he's gonna throw at me"
Chris,we're allowed a cheat sheet too
Chris,thats OP
Chris,I want a cheat sheet
Chris,honestly I'm usually more worried about tests where they let you have a cheat sheet
Chris,cause that means it's hard
Chris,true
Chris,"and it's gonna be more questions testing your understanding and application than your knowledge, which is really all the cheat sheet helps with"
Chris,I got a cheat sheet for my math midterm and I didn't even need it
Chris,@Trapezoider Even if I don't make a new build today the build we are on will be new for you
Chris,@Trapezoider you should get a copy of the cards and make a few decks before we play
Chris,I sent him the pdf
Chris,"just to warn him tho, there's a few cards with two versions in the pdf (at least if it's the same one I've got) and a bunch of unimplemented/banned cards"
Chris,woah
Chris,"from what I remember, knight, scholar, goblin, and berserker are banned atm due to being more than a little OP, there's two versions of stasis chamber (I think the actual one is the one with 1 attack), two grand arbiters (3-cost one is the real one), wild magic is banned, power cultivation might be banned, replicator is banned or at the very least it's getting removed next patch, time walk shouldn't exist anymore, and once there stop being pictures for stuff everything unimplemented"
Chris,at least in my version
Chris,Power cultivation isn't banned
Chris,He has the same version as you @Sak von Sak
Chris,oh I thought it was
Chris,my bad
Chris,Tonights games will probably be the final testing before 1.18 is implemented
Chris,I found another good wrastor
Chris,he wrecked me the first few games but I brought it back
Chris,The mythical good wrastor player
Chris,many deny the very existence of such a player
Chris,@Sak von Sak @Trapezoider @me when you want to play MCG and I'll set up the server
Chris,"I just finished my midterm, I'm gonna get a pizza (which will put me over budget for the week but fuck it I deserve a pizza) and then I'm down to play"
Chris,"it won't actually put me much over budget cause pizza pizza has a clutch deal - large pizza, 3 toppings, dipping sauce, $13 including tax"
Chris,and I can just bring the couple of leftover slices for lunch tomorrow and save some there
Chris,pizza pizza coming in clutch
Chris,@Trapezoider fight me mcg
Chris,@Trapezoider you're letting me down
Chris,@here games?

Chris,@Sak von Sak I think I've figured out a better way to deal with your trap from yesterday
Chris,there's a lot of good ways around it
Chris,but even if you block it I force you to waste a turn blocking it
Chris,and I get at least a knight and a bishop out
Chris,Raven ate the entire stem off of one of our pumpkins lol
Chris,Eww
Chris,Why did you just call her Raven?
Chris,ha
Chris,thats my dog's name
Chris,Oh
Chris,No that's Ava
Chris,Stop lying
Chris,I didn't mean Ava if some of you thought that
Chris,We all know she craves pumpkin stems
Chris,I totally thought you meant Ava
Chris,lololol
Chris,Yeah me too
Chris,I was pretty sure you meant ava
Chris,did ava name herself after the dog or the dog after ava?
Chris,Ava named her online alias after the dog

Chris,God bless my architecture prof and his wonderful curves
Chris,I live to study another day
Chris,"I finally finished persona 5 last night, man that was a game"
Chris,"Indeed, it is a game"
Chris,"I'm still cracking up that I told kameron I was halfway through the final boss at around 830, which was 100% true, and the game wasn't actually over until 11"
Chris,game's ending was longer than most movies
Chris,and it made me feel a lot of things
Chris,That's like the ending of Pokemon sun and moon
Chris,most of them good
Chris,I hate it when you think you are gonna beat a game
Chris,Then the ending takes a million hours
Chris,And you end up staying up all night
Chris,god the ending was so good though
Chris,@undertale
Chris,I wouldn't have cut any of it out
Chris,It's like 30+ minutes of unskipable cutscenes
Chris,this was about two hours
Chris,two glorious hours
Chris,What game is it sylki?
Chris,Nice
Chris,scroll up a wee bit
Chris,you'll see
Chris,Persona 5 you drunk
Chris,Sorry
Chris,I was thinking about rough completion times for most rpgs
Chris,and it's like
Chris,pokemon: 20-30 hours
Chris,chrono trigger: 30-35
Chris,chrono cross: 50ish
Chris,@bois I'm becoming a PI today. Get to go investigate a sketchy corp and acquire police reports and records from the capitol of my state
Chris,xenobladeX: 65
Chris,persona 3: 75
Chris,@wolfstein 20
Chris,xenoblade: 80
Chris,"persona 5, according to my game file, 94 hours"
Chris,that is insane
Chris,Those are looking like my CSGO hours
Chris,Except mine are like +60
Chris,So
Chris,Not that close actually
Chris,"at least on steam, the only games I've played more than 94 hours are tf2, csgo, and rivals"
Chris,"seriously though, incredible game"
Chris,and all I want to do is start again
Chris,try and get all the stuff I missed
Chris,WHOS HYPED FOR NEW WOLFENSTEIN
Chris,I didn't play the first one
Chris,there's a whole bunch
Chris,Oh
Chris,I've played none of them
Chris,I have also played none of them
Chris,"one of my favourite things about studying is coming up with really, really shitty acronyms for things, only for them to actually be useful if only because I'm amused by how terrible they are"
Chris,I sometimes make acronyms too
Chris,"current highlights are SDVE (pronounced like ""Steve""), and SCURP (which is just fun to say)"
Chris,bonus points to myself for figuring out the Steve thing cause the acronym has to be in that order
Chris,nice
Chris,@Rivals of Aether @Cs:go games?

Chris,"m2k's in toronto for canada cup, showed up to a weekly"
Chris,grands was poop m2k

Chris,"so I started a new p5 file with the intent of optimizing the shit out of it, made it like five or six hours in, and I'm now seriously considering restarting, just so that I can name myself 'Locke McLocklin'"
Chris,why am I like this
Chris,yur dumb
Chris,"it's like, five or six hours in a nearly hundred hour game is not all that long, and when's the next time I'm gonna have the opportunity to a) choose first and last name for a characters, and b) have the name 'Locke' be thematically appropriate?"
Chris,"I'm not gonna do it, cause those five or six wasted hours aren't worth the shitty joke"
Chris,I'll save it for if I ever run a rogue in D&D
Chris,"lol ""Guys, the audio seems delayed because light travels faster than sound. The stream is coming from Canada so the difference in speed is magnified."""
Chris,real talk the canada cup stream is messed up in so many ways right now
Chris,"the game audio was a good five seconds delayed for awhile, they also messed up the overlay so the sidese of the game video don't match up with the sides of the box alotted to it"
Chris,kage's going ooooooffffffff

Chris,that was sick
Chris,and n0ne's playing crazy too
Chris,but he's against armada so he's still losing
Chris,he's moving tho
Chris,that was depressing
Chris,n0ne's offense was incredible
Chris,but armada's defense was even better
Chris,"like n0ne was moving insanely fast and getting really neat followups but anything that wasn't 100% guarunteed just wasn't hitting, ever"
Chris,"welp kage's getting m2k, rip canada"
Chris,@here games?
Chris,
Chris,essential if youère gonna be in this server
Chris,heh
Chris,I mean
Chris,okay
Chris,"they need to include some mix of @ here and the tags, so you can @ here + a specific game tag"

Chris,is that better @Eric Working From Home
Chris,you didn't give it to yourself lol
Chris,I gave it to him
Chris,oops
Chris,so uh games or what?

Chris,poor kage's got his third straight sheik after this
Chris,did he play gay sheiks before?
Chris,kirbykaze then android
Chris,"3-1, 3-1"
Chris,but now he's got m2k
Chris,who is a very different beast
Chris,Did you not get his joke?
Chris,prolly ignored cause it was a dumb joke
Chris,oh lol
Chris,that took me a few seconds
Chris,my god they're both nuts
Chris,that was way closer than I was expecting
Chris,"and then n0ne just kinda goes ""oh shit it's game five last stock, better turn up"""
Chris,honestly kage did better than I expected
Chris,lolol they're singing him happy birthday
Chris,"well top 4 is gonna be hype : armada, leffen, m2k, n0ne"
Chris,"lolol street fighter is doing crews, the grand finals is Team Japan 2 vs Team Japan 3"
Chris,"street fighter crews seem weird cause nothing carries over between matches, so it's entirely plausible to just send out your best player first and have them sweep the whole other crew"
Chris,rip n0ne
Chris,that poof kill was so sad
Chris,I'm personally glad to see m2k re-mastering his vs falcon game
Chris,"cause n0ne kept it even all the way till that, and was outplaying him after it, but he died at like 40% and he wasn't playing well enough to bring it all the way back"
Chris,I honestly don't feel like m2k was playing that particularly well
Chris,yo m2k with the quick classic - weak upsmash to tipper fsmash
Chris,Good to see the player I always copy copying me for once
Chris,yo that was awesome
Chris,M2K catches the close range stitch and kills armada with it
Chris,YESSSSSS
Chris,4th time
Chris,that was quite the pop off
Chris,first time ever in a game 5
Chris,he just vanished from the playercam for a good 5-10 seconds
Chris,I missed the stitch catch tho and that makes me sad
Chris,i dont think that there is any doubt now that hbox > armada
Chris,are leffen and plup gonna surpass the other 3 gods tho?
Chris,m2k pogchamp
Chris,m2k's feeling himself
Chris,hopefully he can keep it up for both sets
Chris,I think if he wins it would be his biggest win of all time
Chris,WHAT
Chris,THESE TECS
Chris,Repeat of the 6-0 meme?
Chris,OH MY GAWSH
Chris,HES CRAZY
Chris,He is definitely above plup this year if he wins
Chris,who?
Chris,m2k
Chris,leffen or m2k
Chris,possibly also leffen
Chris,"i mean, plup beat leffen like 4 times"
Chris,h2h doesn't really matter as much in melee
Chris,chu is up 4-1 vs m2k but no one says he should outrank him
Chris,this is true
Chris,good god m2k's going ham
Chris,60-40 XD
Chris,NA crowd
Chris,imo its 50-50
Chris,i know the crowd is chanting 60-40
Chris,it's weirdly stage dependant tho
Chris,yeah I heard
Chris,FD it's like 65-35 for marth
Chris,dream land 60-40 fox
Chris,"it seems like except for hbox, the top 6 is really a toss up right now"
Chris,m2k's going haaaaaaam
Chris,calm down m2k
Chris,Lets go 6-0
Chris,DAT UPSMASH THO
Chris,lol there's one guy cheering for leffen in the crowd
Chris,rip 6-0 dream
Chris,i cry 
Chris,bad melee

Chris,Was this the conservative girl?
Chris,well
Chris,politcally conservative yes
Chris,You know what I meant
Chris,yeah was clarifying
Chris,Welcome back
Chris,this was the girl who seemed kinda sketchy about the whole relationships thing?
Chris,she just kinda ignored me all the time
Chris,after I asked her out
Chris,"(on an unrelated note, someone in the crowd for sfv at canada cup has a massive sign that just says 'SORRY')"
Chris,yeah that seems like a good call
Chris,she didn't ignore me when I said we were done though
Chris,and she sent a snap of her drinking with some dude
Chris,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chris,lol
Chris,Don't respond
Chris,FeelsBadMan
Chris,No
Chris,"I think that's supposed to be a ""I don't need you"" kinda thing"
Chris,That's what your supposed to feel
Chris,which is a massive dick move
Chris,but seeing as you kinda already figured she didn't give much of a fuck about you
Chris,hopefully it's not as bad
Chris,I know I made the right choice and had good reasons but I still feel bad
Chris,"not for her, just bad in general"
Chris,I know that feel
Chris,relationships are weird
Chris,^
Chris,akwardly sits with absolutely nothing to add
Chris,it's honestly made me kinda hesitant to try em out again
Chris,should probably try to get over that
Chris,"also max, you're at college give it a shot"
Chris,There is no one good
Chris,fair
Chris,I feel that
Chris,but you should at least try to make some friends
Chris,No one good... yet
Chris,there prolly is
Chris,you just always find the bad ones first
Chris,that's the best way to find people imo
Chris,damn apparently people sponsored by echo fox won all the smash events at canada cup
Chris,"melee singles: m2k
melee dubs: m2k leffen

Chris,"On a rainy morning in Tokyo, Takao Akizuki, an aspiring shoemaker, decides to skip class to sketch designs in a beautiful garden. This is where he meets Yukari Yukino, a beautiful yet mysterious woman, for the very first time. Offering to make her new shoes, Takao continues to meet with Yukari throughout the rainy season, and without even realizing it, the two are able to alleviate the worries hidden in their hearts just by being with each other. However, their personal struggles have not disappeared completely, and as the end of the rainy season approaches, their relationship will be put to the test. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Chris,"To the outside world, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are the perfect couple. But in reality, they just share the same secret pain: they are both in love with other people they cannot be with. Hanabi has loved her childhood friend and neighbor Narumi Kanai for as long as she can remember, so she is elated to discover that he is her new homeroom teacher. However, Narumi is soon noticed by the music teacher, Akane Minagawa, and a relationship begins to blossom between them, much to Hanabi's dismay. Mugi was tutored by Akane in middle school, and has been in love with her since then. Through a chance meeting in the hallway, he encounters Hanabi. As these two lonely souls spend more time together, they decide to use each other as a substitute for the one they truly love, sharing physical intimacy with one another in order to stave off their loneliness.

Chris,Ouran Koukou Host Club
Chris,"Haruhi Fujioka is a bright scholarship candidate with no rank or title to speak of—a rare species at Ouran High School, an elite academy for students of high pedigree. When she opens the door to Music Room #3 hoping to find a quiet place to study, Haruhi unexpectedly stumbles upon the Host Club. Led by the princely Tamaki, the club—whose other members include the ""Shadow King"" Kyouya, the mischievous Hitachiin twins, and the childlike Haninozuka ""Honey"" and his strong protector Mori—is where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls in the academy. In a frantic attempt to remove herself from the hosts, Haruhi ends up breaking a vase worth eight million yen and is forced into becoming the eccentric group's general errand boy to repay her enormous debt. However, thanks to her convincingly masculine appearance, her naturally genial disposition toward girls, and fascinating commoner status, she is soon promoted to full-time male host and plunged headlong into a glitzy whirlwind of elaborate cosplays, rich food, and exciting shenanigans that only the immensely wealthy Ouran Host Club can pull off.

Chris,Great Teacher Onizuka
Chris,"Onizuka is a reformed biker gang leader who has his sights set on an honorable new ambition: to become the world's greatest teacher... for the purpose of meeting sexy high school girls. Okay, so he's mostly reformed. However, strict administrators and a class of ruthless delinquents stand between Onizuka and his goal and they will use any means, however illegal or low, to drive the new teacher away. Perfect, because Onizuka's methods won't be found in any teaching manual; he cares about the difference between legal and illegal activities about as much as he cares for the age difference between himself and a high school girl. So get ready for math that doesn't add up, language you'd be slapped for using, and biology that would make a grown man blush... unless of course, you're the Great Teacher Onizuka.

Chris,um
Chris,should we be worried?
Chris,he got in car crash
Chris,"I got that part, was mostly worried that there might be something in the aftermath"
Chris,but I guess he meant more in the general case of if he dies cause unforseen circumstances
Chris,Yes
Chris,not sudoku
Chris,I'm very aware right now. Of how fragile life is
Chris,@Sak von Sak have you been in a car crasherino?
Chris,I got hit by a bus while on my bike once
Chris,How did you not die.exe?
Chris,"and I distinctly remember falling towards the side/wheels, and thinking ""SHIT""  and then ""Come on man, if you die here, is that really the last thing you want to think?"""
Chris,Then what :0
Chris,and then some 30-120 second gap in my memory
Chris,next thing I remember is propped up against a building on the side of the road with all the people I was with gathered in a terrified semi-circle around me
Chris,and being sooooo deep in shock
Chris,We're you injured?
Chris,"I survived by not getting hit on, I swerved, my back wheel popped up and I spun into the side then fell off, then.... something"
Chris,"nothing serious, my knees have been even more screwey ever since"
Chris,"he ended up running over my bike, thought he'd run me over and was honestly the most relieved person in the whole event"
Chris,I still have the decimated bike seat

Chris,pubg?
Chris,Leffen got possibly the hardest bracket possible
Chris,yeah thats what the casters just said xd
Chris,Mango>Plup>Armada>Hbox
Chris,"bruh if leffen was on the other side of the bracket, then this would be ez tourney 4 plup"
Chris,now its ez tourney for hbox
Chris,unless big leff goes ham
Chris,but i dont think that plup can win the tourney anymore
Chris,Since leffen won't kill hbox for him?
Chris,ye
Chris,unless mango beats hbox in winners and big leff beats him in losers
Chris,but that prolly wont happen
Chris,ez 4 the box
Chris,"full predictions: hbox 3-0 SFAT, Mango 3-1 Axe, Armada 3-2 wizzy, plup 3-2 leff, hbox 3-1 mango, plup 3-2 armada, hbox 3-0 plup"
Chris,I think armada wizzy will be a 3-0
Chris,yeah you're prolly right
Chris,hbox 4-stock pogchamp
Chris,so much for the 3-0
Chris,3-2 ecksdee
Chris,but my preds are already wrong
Chris,i thought axe's yung link would beat mango's mario
Chris,but it didnt
Chris,you still have gotten set winners correct
Chris,^
Chris,lets go wizy
Chris,can he do it
Chris,hes going ham
Chris,but i have to root against him
Chris,I don't think plup beating armada was the streak being broken because plup was top 6 at then time
Chris,If wizy wins its truely over
Chris,Why do you need to root against wizy?
Chris,for da predictions
Chris,your predictions are not worth the hype of armada losing to a non top 6
Chris,maybe 3-0 at that
Chris,yeah but upsets are only interesting in the short term
Chris,I think if the armada slump continues he will retire
Chris,look at armada's face
Chris,he looks depressed
Chris,yeah
Chris,I think he is actually gonna cry
Chris,CHOKE
Chris,armada is back
Chris,rip the dream
Chris,NOOOOOOOOOOO

Chris,real lit
Chris,the plup samus coming out?
Chris,well rip
Chris,I'm going to be studying that game later
Chris,honestly it was a pretty questionable choice
Chris,the commentators weren't lying when they said it's her worst stage in the matchup
Chris,I know
Chris,FD is my ban
Chris,lets go leffen

Chris,our floor is horrifyingly disgusting
Chris,cause our basement is just concrete and we never go down there expect to do laundry
Chris,and if I left it on the floor they'd have to clean it again and I'm not that heartless
Chris,"one time at my school I saw someone walk into the laundry room, take their load out of the washer, then found a dryer with the most amount of time on it. they just took out someone elses laundy and tossed it on the floor"
Chris,so they got a free dryer

Chris,I just found out that the lead singer of my favourite band has a chronic dissociative disorder that often makes him feel like he's just sort of watching his life in third person with no actual control over it
Chris,and it makes a lot of their lyrics make a lot more sense and also get way creepier in retrospect
Chris,they've got enough songs about losing control of your life and going crazy and killing yourself
Chris,sometimes all three at once

Chris,"I dont really know what hard drugs are, whats a DRUG?"
Chris,the only good experience I've had related to hard drugs is listening to a very drunk friend trying to describe what it's like to be on salvia
Chris,lol  sylki thinks salvia is a hard drug
Chris,i did salvia when i was 2
Chris,I mean from his description it sounded pretty insane

Chris,sure why not
Chris,can confirm: drunk crew battles are the hypest shit on the planet
Chris,Is this IRL or on a stream?
Chris,irl
Chris,some of the worst melee you've ever seen
Chris,but hype as shit
Chris,I got the fastest semi-legit zero to death of my life
Chris,"start of match, got drill shined, tried to cc downsmash but his shine pushed me off stage so it got treated as buffered dair, but he messed up his waveshine and also went off stage, right into my dair and died from it"
Chris,also no one has any ability to maintain reasonable composure
Chris,a guy got in my head by talking about the midterm we both did earlier in the day
Chris,"""Yo what architecture style did you use? you'd better of used pipe & filter or you probably failed.""
""I didn't use pipe and filter""
""Damn son you are FUUUUUUCKED"""
Chris,missing one question means you fail?
Chris,100 mark test
Chris,66 mark question
Chris,I stand by my choice of style tho
Chris,is this the one where failing means you fail the course?
Chris,yeah
Chris,but I'm pretty sure implicit invocation will work jsut fine
Chris,so missing that one question will cost you the course
Chris,hypothetically
Chris,but there's a lot of bits
Chris,getting the wrong style won't make me fail
Chris,also I'm pretty sure my style is just as valid
Chris,if you care for a slightly more coherant answer ask me tomorrow
Chris,okay

Chris,or dadlast
Chris,mrd tried to cheat in mcg yesterday
Chris,lawful good just means you follow a strict code of ethics that is generally good
Chris,"also my quote is wrong. It should be ironically ""My only goal in life is to respect all whamen"
Chris,more like put your dick in all of them  am I right
Chris,nah
Chris,that is not optimal
Chris,"I personally believe that the way I behave as a person makes be the best possible fit for lawful good, although I think my dad could fit it too, we just didn't put him on the chart because he isn't really a part of this server."
Chris,I'm with max on this one

Chris,you can buy that on steam
Chris,and I know we have the disc somewhere I just can't find it and I'm lazy
Chris,yeah I can
Chris,or he could not
Chris,but I already own the game
Chris,and save money on a game his dad owns
Chris,then go look for it
Chris,mighta got lost when we moved a couple years ago
Chris,lol rip
Chris,but if I already purchased the game once
Chris,is it wrong for me to download it somewhere else
Chris,I mean I would probably buy it since its really cheap but in this case I say do what you want
Chris,its $10
Chris,thats nothing
Chris,rich boi
Chris,yeah it is
Chris,$ 10 bucks
Chris,thats like a third tank of gas
Chris,I mean I'm not buying it again  just asking what you though
Chris,*1/4 a tank
Chris,not for meeeee
Chris,i fill up for 30
Chris,then you have a smaller tank
Chris,ye
Chris,but I can go a week+
Chris,so its guchi
Chris,"builds a new gaming pc to play good looking games, spends hours on a game from 2005"
Chris,is retarded
Chris,boys lets play some gaymes
Chris,isn't a mooch ;)
Chris,Pirates is a good game
Chris,
Chris,ooh but what do I name myself tho
Chris,also English ftw
Chris,My name will be Carl Okson
Chris,KArl
Chris,@Max
Chris,yeah?
Chris,I motion for an amendment of the allignment chart
Chris,"I say bitmin should be chaotic evil, and I should be neutral evil"
Chris,I suggested that but Ava insisted it stay how it is
Chris,Facsism is worse than ironically disrespecting whamen
Chris,"also he says ""kind of"" a facist"
Chris,I DID NOT
Chris,also its just a joke so it doesn't really matter
Chris,I'll change yours if you can come up with something better that still fits chaotic neutral
Chris,
Chris,Love this game
Chris,"How dare you attack English ships! For whatever reason, when I played that game I never attacked the English (I was English myself)."
Chris,I don't
Chris,oh is that your fleet?
Chris,Yes
Chris,rip
Chris,Glory to the crown
Chris,get to a port
Chris,Nah I had to divide the plunder
Chris,Am rebuolding
Chris,I'm already an English duke
Chris,nice
Chris,difficulty?
Chris,The third one up I think? I've been advancing each time I divide plunder
Chris,"If faschism were the measure for making someone ""evil"", which I don't think it is (but thats sorta besides the point), wouldent that be characterised closer to lawful ""evil"" rather than chaotic ""evil"" seeing as it usually leads to rules set in place that are very strict and follow a more lawful form of lifestyle or government(regardless of whether its better or not) rather than chaotic ?"
Chris,I agree with this reasoning
Chris,well since I'm lawful with the real law I get lawful evil
Chris,"lawful evil just means you follow a set of guidelines, not necessarily the law"
Chris,"a mass murderer who only kills blond men under 5'3"" is lawful evil"
Chris,a law-abiding asshole who's just generally a dick to everyone would not be lawful evil (probably neutral evil)
Chris,idk how much i agree with that
Chris,"having a standard for who you murder isnt exactly ""lawful"""
Chris,"among the two of us, I'm the one who's actually played D&D"
Chris,and has had the alignments explained in a lot of detail
Chris,"oh, does it?"
Chris,did not kn o w
Chris,well its too late and its a meme anyway
Chris,"lawful normally aligns with the law (particularly lawful good), but that's mainly due to the law being a pre-existing set of moral rules"
Chris,"chaotic generally is following your instincts for good/evil, not having a 'code' that you follow, and placing more value on an individual's choice"
Chris,the whole lawful vs chaotic thing can also be framed in terms of order vs freedom
Chris,
Chris,Facism as a social system has only brought suffering and death to the masses
Chris,"things I learned today: there is a toronto melee player whose tag is 'DACDACBRUCE', a tag that makes even less sense when you realize that his actual name is jonathan"
Chris,Guys it's cornpop
Chris,ew

Chris,"and these mongs are like ""yeah that do"" like shit thought we were playing hte same class forgot blizzard made it so everyones class is different depending on whos playing it"
Chris,"and then later some guy in the discord got an achievement and i said Grats and these mongs are all like ""oh look whos back bet he wants to know the stat weights again"""
Chris,like these fucking monkeys
Chris,go play ret pally get off feral im surprised you even have the brain power to operate this spec

Chris,I understand nothing you just said
Chris,Stat whore
Chris,:p
Chris,bruh i jsut wanted to setup my pawn so it would tell me what gear is better

Chris,Then we all get assigned someone
Chris,"Who we make a gift box for, for a set amount of money"
Chris,Then mail it off in time for Christmas

Chris,Ye me too. @Sak von Sak you in Philip medianson?

Chris,depends how many people we get
Chris,yee
Chris,"I'll ask Ava, max, doc, and chikonN tonight"

Chris,Salt has infused itself with my dna
Chris,
Chris,Fuck me 
Chris,That's your chance
Chris,slide into those DMs
Chris,No
Chris,Is this your ex or something?
Chris,no
Chris,here's the story
Chris,this chick on halloween was dared to kiss me during truth or dare
Chris,and she did and she was like apologizing a bunch about it bein awkward
Chris,and I was the one who was driving her home and so like in my car she was still talking about it XD and I said well oh we'll have to try it again sometime then
Chris,so after that we talk a lot over snapchat and hang out at school and stuff
Chris,and then 2 fridays ago we hung out outside of school and before I took her home we kinda just looked at each other and made out
Chris,so that was chill everything was good
Chris,after that we talked about where we were at and I said I wanted to go out with her but she said she wasn't ready for a relationship yet but that she wanted to date me
Chris,so i was like chill I can wait
Chris,fast forward to this last friday
Chris,was 10/10 stoned with trap and another friend
Chris,I was talking with her and sent a snap that said I really like you or something like that
Chris,and she responds with a long ass snap about how she isn't ready for a relationship and that she couldn't ever see us being more than friends
Chris,and then today she posted that
Chris,"also, saturday she went back to snapping me like we never even had the conversation"
Chris,idk lifes a bitch
Chris,"no, she is xd"
Chris,Women are weird sometimes my dude
Chris,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chris,Yo
Chris,hit her up
Chris,be like
Chris,what's the deal
Chris,??
Chris,see if I do that she's gonna be all pissy and be like oh I thought you were more mature than that
Chris,I'm probably gonna end up doing that tho
Chris,haha true
Chris,we'll see how high I get
Chris,woah
Chris,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chris,"Yo just man up, do it without the green"
Chris,I'm not sure if I want to lose the friendship tho
Chris,Idk man
Chris,Low-key wanna comment in her post like then just go get a boyfriend there are lots of guys it there right?
Chris,@The Rona is that roast good enough?
Chris,It's not terrible
Chris,Make sure that you have every word spelt correctly though if you do post that
Chris,
Chris,I feel like it's just passive aggressive enough to get away with
Chris,I'm bouta fuck myself over prolly but it's finr
Chris,Yeah who cares
Chris,The only reason that the friendship exists in the first place is because of romantic interest
Chris,"Without that, there's not really a point is there?"
Chris,I guess the eventual hopes of her liking me again is the main motive
Chris,"That's probably the hardest part, not gonna lie"
Chris,I'ma comment it
Chris,Whatever happens happens
Chris,I say go for it
Chris,She could either see it as funny and hit you up or see you as a dick
Chris,So
Chris,It's done
Chris,It's whatever
Chris,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chris,Life goes on
Chris,haha
Chris,C'est la vie
Chris,Lmao the response is already in 
Chris,No way
Chris,"""I don't appreciate your salty ass comment"""
Chris,I haven't opened it yet but that's what it says
Chris,Did she dm that to you?
Chris,Yeah over snap
Chris,How do you know what it says??
Chris,Gonna bring up not ready for a relationship probably
Chris,If you don't slide it all the way you can read the right most text
Chris,I see
Chris,"It would have been kinda funny if you commented ""Sorry, I'm not ready for a relationship"" "
Chris,Yours was better though
Chris,Yeah
Chris,Damn she's gonna block me from her sinsta
Chris,Rip
Chris,Oh well
Chris,At least my music is lit
Chris,people who block over stupid things are honestly the worst
Chris,But she is the best
Chris,;~;
Chris,Okay but she probably isn't the best but for some reason I think she is and I feel like doing dumb shit like commenting will make her not be my friend anymore
Chris,And maybe I will stop being obsessed with her if I have a reason to be angry at her
Chris,Jed
Chris,This is what dating Hatcher felt like. Don't get cucked buddy. She may seem like the best thing on Earth right now. But she's being a huge jerk. Stand up for yourself and don't take shit from anyone
Chris,"Yeah, if she acts this petty over one little comment, she ain't worth your time"
Chris,Please help save net neutrality https://www.battleforthenet.com
Chris,Comcast wants to control what you do online. Do you want to let them?
Chris,Comment for “no”. Share this for “oh hell no.” Then click through to actually stop it.

Chris,Yeah

Chris,Yo the punisher is lit
Chris,Yee
Chris,I'm on episode 7
Chris,"While doing research for an essay I'm writing, I came across an idea which is so simple yet I believe could revolutionize the way our government works and I had to share it. What if we made all political donations fully anonymous. If you want to see the full article, PM me with your email addess and I'll send it to you."
Chris,Wow that sounds like a great idea
Chris,why can't you just link the article
Chris,@foreinggovernmentswhowoulddonatebillionstofundnationalpolicythrouhgcandtidatestheyliked
Chris,its on a scholarly database which is restricted
Chris,"basic reasoning behind why that doesn't work is the 'anonymous' bit - the politician just sees the money, not who its from or any messages"
Chris,Can you give me the rundown of how this would affect the government?
Chris,and anyone could claim to have been the donator and there's no real way to prove who it actually was
Chris,helps stop people from giving politicians monetary incentive to support or oppose legislature
Chris,"don't feel like rewriting the article or debating it rn, just PM me your email if you want it"
Chris,"Send me the article max and I will see if I agree with this.. It sounds like an interesting notion, although my natural reaction is to oppose this."
Chris,I will read it tomorrow
Chris,I NEED YOUR EMAIL FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME
Chris,You have my email dork from google docs
Chris,On all the stuff we have collaborated on
Chris,andrewjp42@gmail.com
Chris,Like atlanta docs last year
Chris,also is atlanta 2.0 still on?
Chris,it would be DC
Chris,when?
Chris,summer 2018
Chris,no more detail currently
Chris,@Mr. Airplanes house?
Chris,thats the goal
Chris,okay
Chris,keep me informed
Chris,I need to procure certain amounts of funds into my savings account
Chris,yeah cause I need to start looking at costs now
Chris,@Mr. Airplane
Chris,make us some waffles
Chris,please
Chris,❤
Chris,pancakes are better
Chris,@Mr. Airplane make us pancakes instead
Chris,proper waffles are better imo
Chris,FALSE
Chris,they hold toppings way better
Chris,I'm more into crepes
Chris,#teampancake
Chris,waffles are superior
Chris,crepes are pretty damn good
Chris,@Sak von Sak dont let them decieve you
Chris,#team crepes
Chris,waffles are good but theres nothing better than a big fluffy sweet pancake
Chris,but in the waffles vs pancakes debate waffles are clearly superior
Chris,n0
Chris,yes
Chris,waffles >= crepes > pancakes
Chris,"but like,,"
Chris,you cant cook things into waffles
Chris,"@Trapezoider We have not had a proper conversation on meaningful topics in a long time, you should join up discord for games/discussion more often."
Chris,yeah you totally can
Chris,itll be all burnt n gross
Chris,http://www.strawpoll.me/14455790
Chris,Which is better?
Chris,Vote Now! [Waffles] [Pancakes]
Chris,never happened to me
Chris,
Chris,I prefer to eat lunch food anyways
Chris,@Max
Chris,pancakes have superior texture and flavor
Chris,I concur
Chris,not a fan of breakfast food
Chris,false
Chris,PICK ONE THO MAX
Chris,flavour? they're like 99% the exact same ingredients
Chris,Can we objecitvely prove which is better?
Chris,pancakes
Chris,OH SHIT FAMILY BETRAYAL
Chris,if we are talking highest quality waffles vs. highest quality pancakes waffles take it
Chris,i mean I guess but theres something about waffles thats kinda off putting
Chris,me and ava both chose pancakes
Chris,like theres a flavor there thats just  ? ? ?
Chris,eh
Chris,oh whoops
Chris,how do i describe it
Chris,"the only thing offputting about waffles is how much better they are than pancakes, given that they're the exact same thing cooked in a slightly different manner"
Chris,DIE
Chris,FALSE
Chris,they're like weirdly more bitter
Chris,nah
Chris,dude
Chris,maybe because theyre cooked more harshly
Chris,then you're just screwing up your pancake making
Chris,like who even cares to debate something as meaningless as this
Chris,like everyone in this discord
Chris,wait how? I want my pancakes to be sweeter
Chris,waffles with strawberry compote is the best way to wake up on a saturday
Chris,also I take my food very seriously
Chris,this is serious business!!
Chris,I have trash taste in food so I just eat what I like and keep to myself
Chris,"waffles with strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream, and maple syrup (like actual maple syrup, not whatever weird shenanagins like corn syrup that you guys have in the states) is honestly unbelievably good"
Chris,all that with pancakes instead of waffles is better imo
Chris,I guess we'll have to agree to disagree
Chris,naw cause with pancakes all the syrup and stuff doesn't stay on
Chris,I am a fan of fruit syrups personally
Chris,I mean don't get me wrong maple syrup is still hella good
Chris,pancakes soak up syrup better
Chris,"fruit syrup's alright, but it's not as good as actual maple syrup"
Chris,you can mix 'em and get some good combinations tho
Chris,truth
Chris,waffles soaked in syrup are a weird combo of hard and squishy
Chris,pancakes are soft and nice
Chris,
Chris,why is that a video XD
Chris,why did you make me download that
Chris,eat my waffles filled bootyhole
Chris,@HalfCentaur
Chris,@Trapezoider plane tickets are 358 round trip to dc
Chris,kk
Chris,can u afford
Chris,that will go down after holidays?
Chris,I mean
Chris,probably not
Chris,plane ticket prices can vary greatly over time so be sure to keep checking
Chris,they might be jacking up all prices since its around holidays
Chris,also tristan
Chris,can prolly hook us up with good deals
Chris,I looked at dates in the summer tho
Chris,if you book farther in advance itll be cheaper I think
Chris,they can't do that right now though since we don't know when it'll be
Chris,"His mother is a flight attendant, and is allegedly able to secure cheap flights regularly"
Chris,yeah
Chris,that'd be dope
Chris,if u go octagon pls dont bring weed

Chris,It all makes sense
Chris,never has a steam game taken so long to allocate disk space
Chris,Kameron can afford a bunch of couches because he sells drugs
Chris,"Oh no, I've been found out"
Chris,Gotta move to South America now
Chris,actually I think you've mixed up cause and effect - he has to afford all the couches to store his drugs
Chris,Check out your supply?
Chris,"Kameron, take me with you"
Chris,Going to Columbia?
Chris,yo why the fuck did it have to allocate 50 gigs if the game is actually only 26.6gb?

Chris,I'll play
Chris,is fusion going to play to make it 5?
Chris,yeah
Chris,@Trapezoider csgo with us?
Chris,@The Rona where you at
Chris,welp
Chris,my thermostat is broken again
Chris,rip
Chris,sad
Chris,fucking thing lasted like two weeks
Chris,warranty?
Chris,"leading me to assume that it's either a) a faulty model in general, or b) something wacky's going on with the electricity through that particular bit that's causing the thermostat to keep fucking up"
Chris,it's all handled and paid for by my landlord
Chris,cause the lease more or less legally compels him to give us a functioning house
Chris,"on an unrelated note, I think I might have gotten weirdly good at sm4sh falcon"
Chris,that or the fact that me and the guy I was playing had a combined seven hours of sleep made everything dumb work
Chris,@max
Chris,@Max
Chris,yeah?
Chris,Smash?
Chris,@Sak von Sak you mean your sleep + his sleep was 7 hours?
Chris,yes
Chris,yup
Chris,I had three hours he had four
Chris,K finishing one more run through of moonlight sonata third movement then running upstairs
Chris,3.5 mins
Chris,when is your crew battle thing sylki?
Chris,over
Chris,we didn't get anything on stream
Chris,how did it go?
Chris,which I'm super grateful for because I played like a rusty trash can
Chris,we went 0-2
Chris,but we still go the next round cause top 4 teams make it out and there were only 4 teams
Chris,so I've got time to remember how to play the game
Chris,so hopefully next time I don't lose six stocks and only take three
Chris,double elimination crews are weird
Chris,especially cause there was a grand finals reset
Chris,so it was like an hour and a half long
Chris,"melee crews were hype tho, unfortunately we didn't have a crew cause we couldn't get enough interest "
Chris,but I got to watch one crew's anchor take 12 stocks (that I saw) and lose the battle by one stock
Chris,Good luck next round!
Chris,our second match was kinda funny cause we lost by one stock and every single member of our crew is blaming themselves for not getting one more stock
Chris,"""I had a good read on him but I let him get too much of a lead early on""
""I misinput a kill throw and dropped a stock cause of it and then my next game forgot how to fight ryu until I was already on last stock at death percent""
""I went too deep when I was making a comeback and could have taken that last stock""
""I SD'd at under 50% when the other guy was last stock at 130%""
""I choked under the last stock pressure, the full knees weak arms heavy mom's spaghetti experience"""
Chris,which one is you?
Chris,the second
Chris,"although in afterthough I actually messed up the order, second and third should be swapped"
Chris,my back throw that was supposed to be upthrow was on the last stock of the almost comeback

Chris,"When an Emishi village is attacked by a fierce demon boar, the young prince Ashitaka puts his life at stake to defend his tribe. With its dying breath, the beast curses the prince's arm, granting him demonic powers while gradually siphoning his life away. Instructed by the village elders to travel westward for a cure, Ashitaka arrives at Tatara, the Iron Town, where he finds himself embroiled in a fierce conflict: Lady Eboshi of Tatara, promoting constant deforestation, stands against Princess San and the sacred spirits of the forest, who are furious at the destruction brought by the humans. As the opposing forces of nature and mankind begin to clash in a desperate struggle for survival, Ashitaka attempts to seek harmony between the two, all the while battling the latent demon inside of him. Princess Mononoke is a tale depicting the connection of technology and nature, while showing the path to harmony that could be achieved by mutual acceptance. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Chris,oh my b @Mr. Airplane thought you were trap
Chris,Why does who it is matter?
Chris,cause trap told his mom
Chris,Did you get in trouble?
Chris,did I get in fucking trouble
Chris,lmao
Chris,is that a question
Chris,"Yo, that's actually dick"
Chris,I'm going to counselling now no phone no car
Chris,prolly transfering schools
Chris,rip dc?
Chris,and on top of that my parents told my little brothers that I was making bad choices and my brother asked if I was gonna kill him
Chris,idk
Chris,we'll see if I'm even around then
Chris,don't kill yourself
Chris,you should become a therapist max
Chris,"I'm to brutally honest for that, I would be a much better life coach."
Chris,WHOOSH
Chris,ya know what that is
Chris,@Trapezoider what the fuck man
Chris,thats the sound the joke makes as it goes right over your head
Chris,wait hold up @The Chief Apple what happened dude
Chris,parents found my shit
Chris,did trap intentionally get you in trouble?
Chris,idk all I know is he told his mom that he smoked with me
Chris,snap dude
Chris,and that I peer pressured him  into it
Chris,atleast thats what I heard
Chris,so whats happening with your parents then?
Chris,idk man
Chris,no car
Chris,phone is being watched
Chris,counseling
Chris,and they might try to make me quit my job
Chris,geez
Chris,yeet
Chris,love my family
Chris,that sucks dude
Chris,my brother asking if I was gonna kill him is the worst part
Chris,like fuck
Chris,I'ma take a long walk tonight and see where I'm at
Chris,hopefully everything works out ok my dude
Chris,we'll see
Chris,oh yeah
Chris,I am probably getting transferred back to my old school at some point too
Chris,they almost called the police instead of talking to me about it too
Chris,well at least they didn't do that
Chris,they threatened that if I don't do exactly what they say they still will get police involved
Chris,so I have that hanging over me
Chris,which is nice
Chris,That's honestly stupid
Chris,Not gonna lie
Chris,I dont understand how parents can say something like that
Chris,you right
Chris,I mean you're their kid
Chris,so hey anyone have an extra bed 
Chris,do they not realize how that makes somebody feel?
Chris,but like real shit even ignoring the fact that you're their son who the fuck calls the police on someone for smoking weed
Chris,true
Chris,ESPECIALLY if they're your kid tho
Chris,well obv
Chris,"just got caught up on this, seems pretty dumb"
Chris,I mean I knew the risk
Chris,but still
Chris,they're still overreacting
Chris,it seems like they're handling this poorly
Chris,^understatement of the day^
Chris,what is the right way to handle something like this then?
Chris,oh shit man you smoke weed
Chris,like dont
Chris,^
Chris,"some things they did wasn't unreasonable, but transferring schools is hella dumb"
Chris,give an ultimatum before going all in on the reform
Chris,"I mean, yeah octo's parents are going super far but I don't think just saying ""don't do that"" is going to change anything"
Chris,"you don't decide someone's making bad life decisions, don't force them into worse places"
Chris,help them get somewhere better
Chris,well i mean its not like hes making terrible life choices that will ruin his future forever
Chris,"like ""if you CONTINUE to do this then we'll make you move schools"""
Chris,smoking weed is pretty lax
Chris,was talking from his parents' perspective
Chris,yeah but it is illegal at his age so its not a great idea
Chris,I mean there is no ultimatum
Chris,its all of the above
Chris,"no car, quit your job, go to counseling, possibly switch schools"
Chris,the parts of that that are at least partially reasonable - counselling
Chris,not really anything else
Chris,that quit your job part like what is that supposed to accomplish
Chris,unless it's their car that they're letting you use
Chris,but not any counseling
Chris,Christian counseling
Chris,I think it's so he doesn't have money to buy weed -_-
Chris,oh lord jesus
Chris,save that for the christian counseling jed
Chris,but like... a major part of traditional rehabilitation for stuff like this is to get a job so you become a productive person
Chris,^^^^^^^^^
Chris,but thats the thing
Chris,I smoke
Chris,but I am also a very productive highschooler
Chris,I have good grades
Chris,and a job
Chris,"""hey you seem like a really good kid, lets change that so that you stop smoking"""
Chris,yup
Chris,like literally taking away everything I've worked to get my life in a decent place
Chris,gone
Chris,my advice would be to wait till they've cooled off a bit and then talk to them about it in this context
Chris,there is no talking to them
Chris,my parents are close minded retards
Chris,you'll probably have to take some other punishment but if you can keep the stuff that makes your life better it's worth it
Chris,my life was kinda already shitty before this
Chris,now there isn't gonna be really anything
Chris,fuck
Chris,I dunno what to say man
Chris,
Chris,how would switching your school even help the issue?
Chris,"if they do force you into counselling talk to your counsellor about this stuff, if you can convince them that moving schools and making you quit is bad, they might be able to get your parents to back off a little"
Chris,^ the counselling part might be a blessing not a curse
Chris,just try not to see them as the enemy even if they're trying to make you a perfect little christian
Chris,fuck counseling
Chris,they've tried to make me go before
Chris,try to get the counsellor on your side for this
Chris,if you treat him like trash he'll just tell your parents you're an incorrigible shit and they'll punish you more
Chris,there is literally nothing more they can do to punish me
Chris,they've listed literally everything I enjoy or do
Chris,well if it can't get worse why not try to make things slightly less bad
Chris,I guess except for my pc
Chris,idk
Chris,it literally cannot hurt you
Chris,I wholeheartedly agree with sylki
Chris,yeah you guys are prolly right I'm just still pissed
Chris,fuck I was gonna study for the SAT tonight
Chris,go for that walk
Chris,oh well
Chris,walks are nice
Chris,I can't
Chris,walk around the house if you have to
Chris,I have to wait for everyone to0 go to bed cause I'm on house arrest
Chris,pace the house if you must
Chris,moving helps calm down
Chris,and at worse it's a passive agressive way to keep your parents awake
Chris,although that might not be a good thing

Chris,"Top 10 ""Armada Getting Rekt"" Moments"
Chris,"Includes notable set losses or memorable ""bodied"" moments. The final clip was mislabeled. It is the #1 clip, not the #4 as it says. VOD Sources: 10. Armada v..."

Chris,If I'm still having problems come morning I might stop by the drop in clinic on campus

Chris,It's super simple to learn
Chris,You guys are going to be the ones with all the power in this brave New world of ours

Chris,"@Trapezoider You are always interested in how people learn things so I thought I would share the order in which I learned things in melee (to the best of my memory).
1.    Pick a main (Marth)
2.    Learn basic tech and combos
3.    Switch mains (Sheik)
4.    Switch mains (Jigglypuff)
5.    Learn basic Fox tech
6.    Switch mains (Fox)
7.    Learn the Fox matchup
8.    Learn intermediate Fox tech
9.    Learn the Luigi matchup
(I believe I met you sometime around here)
10.    Acquire a secondary (Sheik)
11.    Learn the Marth matchup
12.    Learn the Sheik matchup
13.    Learn the Samus Matchup
14.    Learn Advanced Fox tech
15.    Acquire another secondary (Falco)
16.    Learn the Captain Falcon matchup
17.    Learn the Falco Matchup"

Even in sad songs it's hard to find songs where they're sung with as much emotion as this one (a lot of the time it's just a sad melody and instrumentals). For those of you who don't feel like listening through the whole thing, the best part is from around 2:30 onwards

Chris,as in its sick
Chris,sick = ill
Chris,does counting crows have any popular songs? cause I feel like I've heard of them before
Chris,I've probably brought them up a few times (they're one of my favourite bands)
Chris,I think I've heard of them too.
Chris,but their best known songs are probably Mr. Jones and Accidentally In Love (which was in one of the shrek movies)
Chris,I know them from Mr. Jones. My mom has played that song in the car so many times.
Chris,"Mr. Jones has over 147,000,000 plays on spotify so i guess you could say its popular "
Chris,oh damn lol
Chris,that's a lot

Chris,
Chris,"Sad Songs: Sullivan Street, The Long December, I Wish I Was a Girl, Goodnight L.A., Holiday in Spain, Black and Blue, Possibility Days, Raining in Baltimore (if you're in the mood for a song that's just straight up depressed)
Not Sad Songs (at least musically): Mr. Jones, Rain King, Murder of One, Come Around, Miami, Insignificant, Cowboys, Shallow Days, American Girls, Daylight Fading, Recovering the Satellites

If you like listening to albums, I haven't listened through all their stuff (hence how I just found Possibility Days), but here's a rough breakdown of the ones I do know:
August and Everything After - mostly sad songs/ballads, overall their best album, only one song on it I don't actively like (ghost train)
Hard Candy - more energetic/rock-like, still has some sad songs, but more songs I don't really like (good time, new frontier, carriage) , and apparently there's a deluxe version that has a few songs I haven't heard yet and I should probably check that out at some point. Probably my 2nd favourite overall.
Recovering the Satellites - chill rock, a lot of good songs but not many phenomenal ones. Third best.
Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings - starts out very heavy on a sort of heavy alt-rock sound that I don't really like, then it hits some good sad songs and then mellows out for the end. Each song is kinda hit-or-miss but there are some really good ones. Would be higher if it didn't have as many songs I don't like."

Chris,@Eric Working From Home
Chris,i have a secret project im going to show you tomorrow
Chris,
Chris,its not your dick is it
Chris,no
Chris,Alright @Trapezoider  and @Jed story update
Chris,I consulted my roommate about his thoughts on the matter
Chris,"and he was like if that is a dodge, that is the stupidest excuse of all time"
Chris,"So then she might actually be concussed, so to not seem like an ass I say I hope you feel better"
Chris,and if you still wanna study just message me
Chris,"She responded with ""Aight"""
Chris,bruh
Chris,it was a dodge
Chris,It was totally a dodge
Chris,SMH
Chris,Yee but like
Chris,Aight is a weak ass response
Chris,That's like the last excuse I would use
Chris,"I dont know dude, this isnt look good. Dont reach out to her for awhile though. When will you see her in person next ?"
Chris,idk
Chris,There's a chance that I see her on one of the exam days
Chris,If we are in the same room
Chris,if not will you prolly not sere her again?
Chris,She might be in one of the same classes as me next semester
Chris,ooh thats guch. I would try to interact as much as possible in person to judge where shes at
Chris,"With my response though, the ball is in her park"
Chris,So if she is interested at all she would probably message me to study
Chris,"If not, she doesn't message me and it's whatever"
Chris,I hope she does or else shes a huge dork
Chris,I don't really care considering I know next to nothing about her
Chris,but is she attractive?
Chris,Yeah
Chris,
Chris,"But if she's someone who's gonna dodge with an excuse like ""I got a concussion"" I probably don't wanna be with them"
Chris,It's like  the boy who cried wolf
Chris,White lies in the short term solve nothing
Chris,and only cause more pain
Chris,Good idea to stay away= from FOLKS LIKE THAT
Chris,@everyone
Chris,Any math studying tips?
Chris,If I do good on this final I have three weeks of bliss
Chris,Do practice problems
Chris,^
Chris,lots and lots of practice problems
Chris,that's my basic plan for my stats exam
Chris,I get an 8.5/11 sheet for notes
Chris,Should I just wright example problems on there too?
Chris,Or concepts
Chris,"put the formulas on it, and if there are practice exams that seem to have common questions right those down too"
Chris,math is for nerds anyways
Chris,Thanks sylki
Chris,And doctor
Chris,no problem
Chris,anything to procrastinate even more on my own studying
Chris,(that's a bit of an exagerration I've already studied a solid amount today and I feel pretty justified in taking the evening off)
Chris,I was gonna study like all day
Chris,But then I spent the whole morning finishing my shity paper
Chris,Because I literally FORGOT
Chris,But doctor is a god and he helped 
Chris,@Sak von Sak Do your math teachers ever default to weird examples?
Chris,Because whenever he talks about any type of regression he always does so in terms of frog populations over time
Chris,occasionally
Chris,mostly my stats teacher goes off on weird tangents
Chris,like the time he somehow ended up discussing how he'd much rather have a goat than a ferrari
Chris,why?
Chris,Is a goat better than a ferrari?
Chris,@The Rona

Chris,"I am very confused. So someone left a comment on a youtube album saying that the album stopped kids from becoming liberals by warning them about the dangers of the world becoming like the one in the album. But the album is about a world where all freedom of expression is basically banned, which kinda happens on both extreme ends of the political spectrum (either agressive safe spaces and everything censored to avoid offending people or on the other end the shutting down of people being some way that they don't like (like gay), and in general on the extremes of both sides just the shutdown of opposing opinions). Funnier still is that the band is a Canadian one so they're probably fairly left by default -_-"
Chris,"on top of which, this album (and a lot of their other stuff) are basically just about how important music is to society, which isn't a political statement in any way"
Chris,and I genuinely can't decide if the comment was a bait or not
Chris,I AM UPSET

Chris,Wait what was the previous chess ai
Chris,Was it deep blue?
Chris,Or was that the one from 1993
Chris,That beat kasperov
Chris,"Deep Blue was the first AI to take a match from a world champion (it beat kasparov). It did this in 1997. The current best chess engine (at least it was) is Stockfish. Google's new AI is called AlphaZero and it beat Stockfish in a 100 game match with 28 wins, 72 draws and 0 losses. It even won 3 games with black (which is very rare at engine level). AlphaZero achieved this after only 4 hours of learning and is likely the strongest chess entity to ever play the game."
Chris,How much training data did it have?
Chris,I love how they name their ai alpha (blank)
Chris,Alpha go
Chris,The go ai
Chris,And now alpha zero
Chris,But seriously how much training data have
Chris,And what was the capactiy of the agents housing?

Chris,@Max why not
Chris,If I play I'm not going to go tryhard with mains
Chris,ok thats fine

Chris,with your buds
Chris,to play well with wrastor i need to grind for awhile
Chris,oh ok
Chris,then don't play wrastor
Chris,^
Chris,that is my main
Chris,when I say no main I mean no wrastor
Chris,in all fairness you said mains
Chris,which means I probably won't play ori
Chris,he is also a character that needs practice to play well
Chris,i feel like if we do a tourney ill prolly get last
Chris,jed might win
Chris,if max isnt playing wrastor
Chris,nah max still beats me anyways
Chris,"I prolly wont be on till kinda late, like 10EST or later, will you guys still be here?"
Chris,yee
Chris,I'll be here
Chris,@Sak von Sak ?
Chris,I don't have to go to school tomorrow
Chris,I'll be there
Chris,I don't have anything tomorrow till like 130
Chris,noice
Chris,my sleep cycle is totally screwey tho
Chris,"couldn't fall asleep till 4am last night, woke up at 730, couldn't fall back asleep till 9, slept till like 1230"
Chris,thats me over the summer
Chris,damn I barely know street fighter but this is a hype tournament
Chris,I'm just gonna cheer for this one japanese dude who plays the only character I vaguely know how to play
Chris,I prolly won't be here till 8ish pst
Chris,im nto sure yet tho
Chris,jk ima be here
Chris,ha even armada's watching capcom cup
Chris,and he's cheering for the same guy as me
Chris,ha

Chris,OW?
Chris,yes

Chris,Our man Devon can't watch tonight
Chris,
Chris,Tomorrow then?
Chris,I will be home at like 9 PST
Chris,Or we just watch anyways XDEEEEE
Chris,also @Homies I read something about a rivals tournament maybe?
Chris,"If there is a tourament, it will be late. Although late is relative and since you are PST it might not be that late for you."
Chris,kk
Chris,good god this tournament's hype
Chris,???
Chris,capcom cup
Chris,tis a street fighter tournament
Chris,like the biggest non-evo one of the year
Chris,LINK
Chris,https://www.twitch.tv/capcomfighters
Chris,CapcomFighters - Twitch
Chris,Capcom Cup Day 2 - Top 32 to Top 8
Chris,you just missed a nutty winner's finals
Chris,"@Rivals of Aether ill be there in 30, lets start the tourney then"
Chris,kk
Chris,kkk
Chris,kkkk
Chris,kkkkk
Chris,f
Chris,no
Chris,pay your respects man
Chris,street fighter looks so hard
Chris,apparently this is the easiest street fighter
Chris,they made a ton of stuff more lenient
Chris,ah
Chris,dude nemo tho
Chris,nemo's the guy I'm cheering for
Chris,due to having played like 15 minutes of urien once
Chris,I've only watched one but same
Chris,urien just seems cool
Chris,yee let's go nemo
Chris,This game looks so boring
Chris,huh
Chris,I think it looks pretty interesting
Chris,"but part of that is I probably have a bit of a better idea of what's going on (not by a ton, but somewhat)"
Chris,I've watched a lot of different traditional fighters and this one seems by far the least interesting.
Chris,it's not quite as crazy as a lot of them but it's way easier to tell what's going on
Chris,"imo my favourite one to watch is p4a, shame it's basically a dead game (they released a really good balance patch... only to the arcade version and so like half the community migrated and the other half couldn't and it killed the game for the most part)"
Chris,I'm so happy to have finally made some progress. I clapped so hard my hands now hurt.
Chris,(This is minesweeper for those who don't play)
Chris,@Rivals of Aether les go bois
Chris,I'm gonna watch till the end of this set
Chris,which might be pretty fast
Chris,mmmk
Chris,@Trapezoider there is a losers bracket
Chris,why
Chris,smh
Chris,So you can have a second chance
Chris,@Homies R I V A L S O F A E T H E R I S A F U C K I N G G A Y A S S G A M E
Chris,no u
Chris,ur mum gay
Chris,no ur mum gay
Chris,@Mr. Airplane @Sak von Sak Let me know who wins!
Chris,ur mum gay
Chris,@Max I won 3-2 3-1
Chris,Nice
Chris,I'm super happy cause it was a great set
Chris,but I'm still super salty
Chris,same
Chris,ugh one game I sd'd at like 5
Chris,fucking xxxswagdabkamxxx
Chris,and lost a really important game cause of it
Chris,@Max come play me
Chris,I don't want to
Chris,I only played the tourney as a favor I'm not really enjoying ROA right now
Chris,melee then?
Chris,in about 10 minutes
Chris,kk
Chris,you are boosted mans
Chris,I don't understand
Chris,I've lost 1 out of 10 ranked games
Chris,"@everyone finally finished putting together a rough outline of a tabletop rpg campaign (basically D&D, but not actually D&D), can I have a show of @me for a rough indication of numbers for who'd be interested? I'm either gonna start running it like, tomorrow evening or in the new year, haven't decided yet"
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,yes
Chris,@Sak von Sak I might be game
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,@Sak von Sak for kameron
Chris,hes down
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,can we start tomorrow? @Sak von Sak
Chris,probably yeah
Chris,sweet!
Chris,we got more people than I expected so I'm gonna have to tweak the fight I had planned
Chris,"but meh, it's fun to put characters together"
Chris,Now I've got to come up with a clever character that isn't just lawful good
Chris,tomorrow will probably be like two-ish hours of character creation
Chris,so you don't need a ton of premise
Chris,TWO HOURS???
Chris,yote
Chris,character creation takes ages
Chris,especially since you guys don't know the system or any of the charms (there are probably upwards of 100) which form the basis of your character
Chris,and from what I've found you'll probably get ideas for how you want your character to be as a person as you start putting them together as a bundle of stats and abilities
Chris,@Sak von Sak rivals?
Chris,naw
Chris,hands kinda hurt
Chris,com'on
Chris,nope
Chris,kk
Chris,thou shalt not tempt me
Chris,t h o u s h a l t n o t t e m p t
Chris,t h o u g h s h a l t u s e t h e s p a c e b a r
Chris,a l o t
Chris,How similar is the character creation to D&D?
Chris,ish
Chris,it's a bit more straightforward imo
Chris,there aren't clearly defined classes in the same way
Chris,"which is good and bad - good that I don't have to cover how to play different classes for each person who's playing, bad in that you have a ton of options no matter what"
Chris,"also there's fewer weird things with equipment and race, and there's no super complex classes where you're choosing religions and the associated weird benefits and stuff"
Chris,https://i.imgur.com/6LaF38R.png
Chris,silver snipers op
Chris,^
Chris,Where can I find a VOD of them?
Chris,They probably don't have one

Chris,@Feral Nebula Need backup
Chris,huh?
Chris,I'm in for sayori on monika
Chris,but honestly it's doki doki literature club the characters aren't that that deep
Chris,yuri is bAD
Chris,ffs someone play something where there is an actual valid best girl to be had
Chris,ddlc doesn't have the character depth to justify this much of a best girl fight
Chris,true
Chris,do I need the dlc?
Chris,
Chris,there's dlc?
Chris,I'm not arguing for the best. Just that Yuri was the worst by far.
Chris,Yeahi ts like 20
Chris,no you don't
Chris,let people have their opinions tho @ max
Chris,yeah you communist]
Chris,Yo im bout to get some cupcakes
Chris,from the literature club

Chris,cause he finished daddy dating simulator and needed a new on e:P
Chris,I didnt even know this game existed

Chris,its premise is incredibly alienating but it's incredibly good
Chris,it might sound cheesy but it literally changed me as a person
Chris,the only way you're getting me to play roblox is as a meme
Chris,Sylki plays dating sims???
Chris,just the one
Chris,It's the only way he can get women
Chris,wait you don't
Chris,?
Chris,gotta fill the void some how
Chris,and I only started it out of spite so that I could critique people who kept telling me to from a more informed perspective
Chris,and then somehow I actually ended up really liking it
Chris,LOL
Chris,gg
Chris,yeah hes not gay
Chris,hes a cool mans
Chris,@Sak von Sak dating sims are cool
Chris,in general I will disagree
Chris,because of how REALISTIC THEY ARE

Chris,nyoom
Chris,nyoom
Chris,same
Chris,lol
Chris,"so I've been putting together one last character for day one of the campaign, I might not end up using them cause I kinda made them op as fuck"
Chris,they kinda got away from my original idea of a graceful grappler kind of a fighter
Chris,"she can grab you, do a genuinely unreasonable amount of damage, possibly freeze you for as many turns as she does damage, and then while you're frozen trap you in a bubble that will probably take at least two turns to break through even after you defrost"
Chris,what the fuck dude
Chris,Thats op
Chris,This man is a monster
Chris,"oh and she also has a pretty unreasonable amount of health and defense, a few skills that increase her defense even further, and a skill that can force you to ignore a squishy person until you deal with her"
Chris,which you're not gonna be able to cause she's tanky as fuck and is just gonna freeze you and trap you in bubbles
Chris,yo balance these mans
Chris,dont delete her
Chris,this lady's getting balanced
Chris,just tone down?
Chris,"I'm removing the tankiness and the forcing you to deal with her first, reducing her damage"
Chris,so now maybe she won't look like this
Chris,OH MY GOD
Chris,WHO IS THESE MANS
Chris,What is the setting for this campaign?
Chris,modern fantasy
Chris,im hyped
Chris,So I can be a school girl?
Chris,im actually hyped as fuck
Chris,can I be a columbine shooter?
Chris,:-:
Chris,probably not
Chris,k
Chris,also yes you can 100% be a schoolgirl
Chris,Sweet
Chris,k if theres a sschool girl
Chris,I might be a schoolgirl
Chris,when I played this I played a schoolgirl
Chris,there needs to be a school shooter
Chris,smh
Chris,we also had a hairy motherfucker in his midthirties who was kind of a pedo
Chris,it was hilarious
Chris,can I be a generic terrorist?
Chris,not really
Chris,uGHHH
Chris,you're kinda prevented from being all that evil by the premise of the game
Chris,you can only be a little evil
Chris,Can I be a terrorist whos suicide vest didnt detonate so now he just screams allah ackbar at everyone he meets?
Chris,please no
Chris,"although you could, with a bit of work, plausibly be a reusable suicide bomber"
Chris,it just wouldn't be practical
Chris,y e s
Chris,p l e a s e
Chris,Actually ima be a kekistan memer who lives in his moms basement
Chris,it's far easier to throw explosives or set traps than attach them to yourself
Chris,I do not condone this
Chris,cause you'd need at least one or two charms to make sure you don't die every time you blow yourself up
Chris,also you need to get the explosives from somewhere
Chris,yo this sounds complicated as fuck
Chris,yeah no shit being a reusable suicide bomber is complicated
Chris,
Chris,please let me do it
Chris,Trap
Chris,please
Chris,Please fucking let me be  a reusable suicide bomber
Chris,no\
Chris,T H I S I S M Y C A L L I N G N I B B A
Chris,sigh
Chris,"basic plan at this point is character creation -> test fight with a team I've put together -> tweaking your characters, so you can give it a shot"
Chris,y e s
Chris,TTHANK YOU
Chris,Thank you dungeon master
Chris,
Chris,"basic rule #1 of DMing: if it sounds dumb, and your player wants to try it, let them try. If it crashes and burns, you warned them. If it works, then it's fun."
Chris,My friend tried for like 10 minutes to tame a wolf in some cave
Chris,My other friend ended up killing in on purpose
Chris,yo sylki
Chris,Gotta be honest
Chris,never played dnd
Chris,Parents thought it was satanic 
Chris,lololol
Chris,"What, how?"
Chris,so this is gonna be me being fucking autisic and doing dumb shit
Chris,while everyone wrecks
Chris,I mean you can basically worship satan in traditional d&d
Chris,yee
Chris,I mean
Chris,my parents are super religious
Chris,you can
Chris,I wasnt allowed to play pokemon
Chris,because they thought it was satanic
Chris,my childhood was fucked
Chris,
Chris,woah woah you're parents are those people??
Chris,That's a feelsbad
Chris,ye
Chris,thats why crazy shit happens sometimes round here
Chris,"on an unrelated note, holy shit I just realized it's technically possible to have a character who, out-of-the-box after character creation, can summon and control thunderstorms"
Chris,@mycomputerbeingthrowninagarbagecaninasnowstorm
Chris,Dibs
Chris,dibs
Chris,they can't do... anything else
Chris,I already called it
Chris,bids
Chris,I'm gonna be a little school girl who controls the weather
Chris,i call shotgun
Chris,btw you can just... get that a little later
Chris,
Chris,it's not even all that good early game because your activation stats will be meh
Chris,yo do we get mounts?
Chris,?
Chris,do we get M O U N T S to increase movement?
Chris,Like could I theoretically ride a goat into battle
Chris,yes
Chris,FUCK YES
Chris,there's even a fighting style for mounted combat
Chris,I AM THE REUSABLE GOAT RIDING TERRORIST
Chris,your goat would die every time you detonated tho
Chris,how expensive are goats?
Chris,fucked if I know
Chris,I haven't looked into it
Chris,canI just keep buying more goats?
Chris,theoretically
Chris,CaN i have a swarm of goats follow me into battle?
Chris,like the zerg
Chris,but goats
Chris,I don't think they'd attack for you
Chris,I'd have to skim the rules and charms
Chris,Damn
Chris,see if there is a possess charm
Chris,so I could possess all the goats
Chris,but I'm probably gonna say no just cause that'd make combat a bitch
Chris,and the goats would all have to have their own turns
Chris,holy shit yeah
Chris,and it'd take forever
Chris,wouldnt we have to roll for every goat
Chris,Yeah
Chris,LOL
Chris,yes
Chris,not fun for the everyone else tho
Chris,OH MY GOD
Chris,"Sylki, I didnt realize how hype this game could be"
Chris,holy shit bois
Chris,"ok so there is in fact a charm called ""Tame the Savage Beast"" which lets you give animals commands"
Chris,it has an upgrade
Chris,oh god
Chris,swarming: can give orders to a whole swarm of creatures
Chris,although they have to be small
Chris,FUCK YESS
Chris,ie not goats
Chris,GOATS ARE SMALL
Chris,GOATS ARE SO SMALL
Chris,"this is like, small birds/insects/mice small"
Chris,
Chris,look how small these mans are
Chris,@Max brb replacing one of my existing characters with a recreation of Skitter
Chris,
Chris,these mans are so small
Chris,no
Chris,you can command a single goat
Chris,okay mans
Chris,Wait sylki
Chris,...
Chris,Is there a charm to miniaturize things?
Chris,
Chris,oh dear
Chris,lemme look
Chris,technically yes
Chris,applying it to goats would be unreasonably expensive
Chris,Don't feed him Sylki
Chris,he couldn't get all the bits necessary till late game
Chris,so I don't mind this one
Chris,"Can I be a really old wise wizard who, instead of dying, opted to transfer his soul into robot/new body (a kid)."
Chris,Sylki
Chris,I will make this dream happen
Chris,My imagination has been empowered
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,nope
Chris,rip the dream
Chris,you could be a wise old wizard who did die and was reborn and remembers his past life
Chris,omg
Chris,although it's kinda hard to wizard in this game
Chris,the traditional wizard-style stuff isn't super practical
Chris,I might add the remembers past life to a different class
Chris,I USED TO BE A KING
Chris,and stuff like that could be fun
Chris,I can't wait to see how your king interacts with trap's lunatic miniature goat herder
Chris,yes this will be interesting
Chris,And my Schoolgirl
Chris,
Chris,Who may or may not be controlling the weather
Chris,The king demands it stops raining
Chris,rains more
Chris,struck by lighting
Chris,"just a recommendation, don't build for storms out of the gate, build for storms a few level-ups later"
Chris,cause if you build for immediate storms your character sucks at first
Chris,
Chris,aight buff grappler is no longer op (or buff)
Chris,"still has that hilarious grapple -> freeze combo, but I removed the additional bubble thing, reduced her damage, health, and defense"
Chris,"op buff grappler might come back at some point tho, it's too good an idea to pass up"
Chris,Suddenly a swarm of goats ascends into the air and generates a whirlwind which dispells the storm
Chris,ok you can't have flying goats
Chris,I'm pretty sure that one's impossible
Chris,C H E C K THE RULES
Chris,See if there is a levitation charm
Chris,yes but it only applies to you
Chris,you can't levitate other people
Chris,
Chris,wait shit you can
Chris,Thats actually a bummer
Chris,but you have to also be flying
Chris,OKAY
Chris,SO MY MAN
Chris,Dang
Chris,YOU ARE TELLING ME
Chris,I need this
Chris,I'll be like storm
Chris,I CAN LEVITATE WITH A SWARM OF MINITUARIZED GOATS
Chris,"technically, yes"
Chris,technically I am about to nutt
Chris,you will be basically useless in all other situations tho
Chris,oh shit im prolly gonna die
Chris,If I dont levelup my characters normal abilities
Chris,smh
Chris,"cause the charms you need for the levitating, the size changing, and the size changing applied to goats are all really expensive"
Chris,like lots of experience to get to them
Chris,and lots of mana-equivilant to use them
Chris,damn
Chris,how long will this run take?
Chris,for us to complete as a group
Chris,I have no idea
Chris,Whats the longest run you have done?
Chris,once a week for like 8 months
Chris,Are you willing to DM this all the way through if it takes a million years
Chris,but I've never DM'd
Chris,and I don't know how long my planned plot will last
Chris,Im so hyped bois
Chris,my advice is roll with a smaller goat-related goal
Chris,if he gets goats I want wolves
Chris,no fuck you
Chris,wOW
Chris,offended
Chris,goats > everything else
Chris,WOLVES
Chris,jokes
Chris,are cool
Chris,its a meme
Chris,ur a meme
Chris,same issue as with goats - you can only realistically run one wolf or goat at a time
Chris,Please tame your flying miniture goats
Chris,sad
Chris,then I will have one wolf friend
Chris,unless you want to spend a fuckton of exp on making them little
Chris,THEN MAKING THEM LEVITATE
Chris,christ
Chris,this is gonna be a good time
Chris,"on that note, it's 230am, I'm going to bed"
Chris,'night sylki

Chris,I wish I could control my desires smh
Chris,If I could keep the same level of motivation I get for stuff in the beginning over a long period of time
Chris,I would be a god
Chris,The only thing I do that with is piano
Chris,How do I improve this low trait consciencousness part of myself?

Chris,Then you just wait for his gust of wind
Chris,He never fucking comes to the trench
Chris,And paraglide around him till his horns turn blue

Chris,Is that online or in person
Chris,Also @Sak von Sak
Chris,Online
Chris,Can you talk for a few minutes?
Chris,There aren't really any locals
Chris,I didn't think their would be
Chris,"Cool piece of data from an old stats exam I'm doing (this is an actual cited study, ie true data): Researchers tested a sample of women shortly after they had given birth in a large urban hospital. Each mother, blindfolded to prevent sight or smell, felt the hands of her own infant plus two others of the same sex. Of the 68 mothers with at least an hour exposure to their newborns, 47 correctly identified their own baby."
Chris,What the fu
Chris,That is incredible
Chris,"the actual question wanted us to figure out exactly how unlikely that is to occur by chance, and the result was the most extremely unlikely result I've seen in this entire course"
Chris,even taking into account the relatively small sample size
Chris,"the exact percentage value isn't even included in the chart we get for calculating exact percents cause it's so unlikely that every point is basically the same, but the actual value ends up being less than 0.000000001% that that result was a fluke"
Chris,"basically, if it is actually pure guesswork and only 1/3 of the time they should have guessed right, there's a less than 0.00000001% chance that the study would produce those results or results more extreme than that"
Chris,That's mental
Chris,Yo is it homosexual to be a mother?
Chris,"No, it is incest though"
Chris,Like
Chris,you had your kid inside of you
Chris,

Chris,aggroforlife
Chris,"@Melee This combo video has a lot of sentimental value to me as it was one I really enjoyed during my early days of melee. It also shows a lot of the story lines of the time and, in a way, is even better now considering we know what will happen with Hungrybox. Just re-discovered this and thought I would share it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKpp7NOwH5w"

Chris,don't spend it all in one place
Chris,ye
Chris,im leaving my rig mining every day
Chris,and its free because I dont pay electricity
Chris,so $4 a day
Chris,not bad over a year
Chris,spread your marvelous bounty across multiple vending machines
Chris,Yo just gonna save the btc I get
Chris,so youre basically stealing from your parents
Chris,lololol
Chris,are you fucking retarded
Chris,You steal by existing
Chris,I wonder what the actual electricity breakdown is tho
Chris,All of us did
Chris,no its charity
Chris,but there's no way he's drawing enough that it's noticeable
Chris,then they are being gracious enough
Chris,to pay my electricity bill
Chris,well If I was paying it
Chris,It would be enough to make my profits negligible
Chris,also the current btc directory is 150 gb
Chris,smh
Chris,the blockchain is so huge
Chris,does it really take that much energy to make bitcoins?
Chris,yeah you are basically running your gpu on max all day
Chris,huh
Chris,do you know what a gpu is?
Chris,it's the graphics card
Chris,its a graphics processing unit
Chris,yeah
Chris,essentially
Chris,the calculations needed to generate bits on the blockchain
Chris,are very similar to graphics processing
Chris,so gpu's work best for btc mining
Chris,and running a modern gpu on full power
Chris,all day

Chris,"one of my non-exam courses finally got all the marks in, due to the wonder of bonus marks I managed to squeak my 89 up to a 90"
Chris,which is a huuuuuge deal
Chris,cause 89 is treated the same as 80
Chris,and 90 is treated the same as 100
Chris,"one thing about math stuff is that a lot of the time things that sound super complicated are actually pretty straightforward, but I think I've finally found something that sounds pretty much just as complicated as it is"
Chris,"""One-way completely randomized analysis of variance"""

Chris,@The Rona
Chris,?>
Chris,how was ur exam
Chris,my dude
Chris,good
Chris,One question that I didn't know how to do though
Chris,there was a question that i had no fucking clue what the answer was on my programming midterm so i just guessed and got full marks
Chris,like is was the second most heavily weighted question
Chris,"""what are the 5 steps of pre planning"""
Chris,"and i was like i think nityan has said something about DDIT (Design, Develop, Implement, Trace)"
Chris,but thats only 4
Chris,fuck just add F to the end and say final test
Chris,and apparently that was right
Chris,so I guess an earthquake just happened where I'm at?
Chris,Are you dead?
Chris,I wish
Chris,I didn't even feel it tbh
Chris,oh prolly cause it wasn't in my city
Chris,are you suicidal
Chris,Why would you WANT an earthquake????
Chris,cause that'd be awesome
Chris,Dude death by earthquake would be epic
Chris,I didnt feel it either
Chris,I think these fags are lying
Chris,also @Feral Nebula
Chris,its almost T I M E
Chris,i s  i t
Chris,ye
Chris,It was centralized in mollala so that's why it was weak if that here
Chris,well we better get used to it
Chris,were going to be south of the bay area in two years
Chris,Lots of earthquaks my dude
Chris,also my phone is almost as big as my switch
Chris,smh
Chris,Oi lmoi
Chris,boi
Chris,I was playing this cocky ass clairen who taunted after every kill
Chris,and he taunted before I died last stock game 2 and I killed him for it
Chris,and then took game 3 as well
Chris,so satisfying
Chris,@Jed Which character were you playing?
Chris,ranno
Chris,GG
Chris,destroy all Clairen players
Chris,but you played Clairen in tourney...
Chris,that was because sylki revealed what I was actually playing
Chris,but still
Chris,you used what you despise
Chris,ye
Chris,hes right
Chris,you refuse to teach me clairen
Chris,because you dont want anyone playing clairen
Chris,then you play him in tourney
Chris,Why do you think I took the character choice path I did in melee
Chris,the logic here actually makes sense
Chris,I picked the character that beat my previous character the hardest until I got to fox
Chris,Marth to Shiek to Puff to Fox
Chris,if you hate op characters
Chris,why the fuck do you play fox lmao
Chris,Fox is not OP
Chris,he has weaknesses
Chris,so does clairen
Chris,He wouldnt be beatable if he didnt
Chris,not in the same sense
Chris,I DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING
Chris,AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED ANYTHING
Chris,DON'T PIN THIS ON ME
Chris,to beat clairen you just have to play better
Chris,also kameron wrecked your Clairen thus not OP
Chris,To beat fox you have to play better
Chris,Clairen has not real exploitable weakness
Chris,thats literally how rivals goes
Chris,lmao
Chris,you must play better
Chris,Clearly false if kam can beat you?
Chris,"poor you, you have to play better to beat someone"
Chris,my Clairen has under 2 hours total play time
Chris,boo hoo
Chris,By play better I mean play better + extra
Chris,so you can play better than them and still lose if it isn't by enough
Chris,Also the fox matchup...
Chris,lmao
Chris,Falco Marth and Samus all go even with fox
Chris,no one goes even with clairen
Chris,How can that be true lmao
Chris,which part?
Chris,No one goes even with clairen
Chris,From my experience either her range or her down b make her beat every character
Chris,Then get gud
Chris,^
Chris,or play a better game
Chris,@Jed
Chris,you gonna take that shit?
Chris,I think max complains too much about a character that I've heard commentary from good players
Chris,Real talk I still almost always beat Clairen on ladder and against Jed. I just think the character is stupid.
Chris,so get gud does not really apply
Chris,I'm already good I just don't have fun when playing against her
Chris,games are meant to be fun
Chris,"I dont have fun playing against fox. Does that mean fox is bad, and we should all complain against fox?"
Chris,so it isn't a matter of OP just a matter of not liking the matchup
Chris,Are you gonna quit melee because you hate the falco matchup?
Chris,No
Chris,cause I don't like playing against Zetters
Chris,You grind the matchup
Chris,DO YOU THINK I ENJOY SAMUS PUFF
Chris,and get good
Chris,it does apply
Chris,DO YOU
Chris,Why would you play melee if you you hate the matchup that you will be playing more than any other @Trapezoider ?
Chris,Because I like conquering the thing I despise with all my heart
Chris,that was really only right after the dlc dropped
Chris,Its why I play the game
Chris,Its also why I go through cycles of not
Chris,playing
Chris,Because I get frustrated and do rage quit the game because of dumb matchups I suck at
Chris,But
Chris,I kEEP  COMING BACK
Chris,but you still enjoy conquering the hard matchup
Chris,I don't
Chris,Because the eternal alure of the mountains I have to climb is more addicting than most thrills in life
Chris,hence why I never play bad characters in anything
Chris,The only thing Im pointing out why its dumb for you to complain about a strong character
Chris,Because you are the guy who defaults to strong OP characters
Chris,
Chris,strong does not equal over powered
Chris,Semantics
Chris,naw actually that's valid
Chris,but still
Chris,I think you're overreacting to clairen
Chris,^
Chris,If I liked her I would play her
Chris,I've been annoyed about it for a while just never said anything
Chris,you did play her...
Chris,for a day
Chris,In tournament
Chris,ONE MATCH FOR THE MEME
Chris,that is not evidence
Chris,that was not for the meme
Chris,"Why am I getting attacked over hating a character??? If Sylki randomly decided to post ""I hate falco"" I garuntee this wouldn't happen. Let me have an opinion."
Chris,you were mad that I said you weren't playing clairen
Chris,which you thought told kameron who you were playing
Chris,so you played clairen
Chris,I do hate falco
Chris,but I sucked it up
Chris,and I'm now pretty good against falco
Chris,honestly I think that Rivals is a fairly balanced game and its moreso playing the opponent than whatever character they choose
Chris,same with sheik
Chris,I sucked it up and I'm alright at the matchup now
Chris,now you are a G 0 D
Chris,its all about the grind matchup isn't important
Chris,so my brother works at uber
Chris,and apparently he takes an uber to work every day
Chris,"and frequently has a conversation that basically goes:
uber driver: so, where do you work?
my brother: oh, I work at uber.
uber driver: neat, how long have you been driving for them?
my brother (presumably insufferably smug): hahahaha no I'm an engineer at uber."
Chris,Does he get free Uber credits tho
Chris,yeah he gets like $200 free uber a month
Chris,
Chris,yo that man is straight up about to revolutionize the way we transport
Chris,Uber published a 95 white paper on electric VTOLS
Chris,I read the whole thing
Chris,Im hooked
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,is he working on that?

Chris,he's doing some thing for people to sign up

Chris,Did they fucking pass the repeal

Chris,Jed Canada is an option right?
Chris,yeah I think we still get net neutrality lol
Chris,finally a widely acceptable way that canada > us
Chris,The vote went 3-2
Chris,It passed
Chris,Canada here I come 
Chris,"Better health care, net neutrality"
Chris,"there's a lot of things I like about canada over the us, they're just not things that are universally appreciated (like free health care, gun control, adding 'u' to the spelling of words that don't strictly need it but imo it looks better, a more logical election system, better skiing, not being a terrorist target, etc.)"
Chris,Better skiing 
Chris,it's true
Chris,mostly just cause we've got more area that has good skiing weather so statistically we get more good mountains for skiing
Chris,you guys get a bit of the rockies and that's about it
Chris,"okay Google, how do I get Canadian citizenship"
Chris,honestly you can kinda just show up and ask nicely
Chris,if you live here and have a job at least
Chris,So not an extremely long difficult process like the us?
Chris,"we have a system that basically ranks you based on how much we think you'll benefit our society which takes a bit to get through (especially if you get ranked low), but honestly upper middle class white people showing up and getting a job on visa is pretty much a guaruntee that you'll get citezenship"
Chris,it's not instant but it's faster than the states
Chris,
Chris,"one thing that was kinda funny is that the states introduced a plan kinda like that, where people get ranked based on desireability and some canadians were acting all offended and like 'wow that's not a nice way to decide citezenship, canada's above shit like that'"
Chris,@The Rona Going to see Star Wars tonight 
Chris,noice
Chris,it's supposed to be reaaaally good
Chris,wait who has seen it?
Chris,my showing is the first
Chris,prescreenings exist
Chris,especially for reviewers so that they can have people say it's good to get more people to come watch on opening night
Chris,I normally don't trust mass opinion of whats good. I'm just hoping it isn't a copy paste of Empire Strikes Back like the last one was a copy of A New Hope.
Chris,It probably will be

Chris,Which beat another Google ai (alpha go- ie the best go player in the world) in 100 out of 100 games
Chris,So they just improved the best ai by 100 fold
Chris,Ai developments are so non linear
Chris,It's incredible

Chris,So he's okay with you vaping?
Chris,I don't think so
Chris,I was giving it to them because my mom was concerned that I would be tempted by it while they were gone
Chris,cause I'm tryna sell it
Chris,Would you have used it if they didn't take it?
Chris,nah
Chris,I don't have anymore juice

Chris,ay wrenchd is playing in the rcs tourney today
Chris,I agree
Chris,bruh what if you looked through a 1 way mirror and on the otherside was a mirror
Chris,cause wouldn't it just reflect nothing?
Chris,or reflect a reflection of a reflection
Chris,it'd be just like two mirrors reflecting each other
Chris,just without you being in it
Chris,but like
Chris,what does a mirror look like
Chris,it reflects light
Chris,whatever light is present will be reflected back and forth between the mirrors
Chris,literally all mirrors are one-way mirrors with a solid thing stuck to the back
Chris,"the reason one-way mirrors work is cause one side is way darker than the other, and on the light side enough light is being reflected that you can't see the stuff on the other side"
Chris,I highkey wanna buy a one way mirror now
Chris,yeah
Chris,Ok
Chris,The Last Jedi was really fucking good
Chris,like a room like this
Chris,
Chris,but with an external light source
Chris,so you don't see all the lights reflecting
Chris,problem with external light is that then you'll just see the outside
Chris,that only works because the light is on the inside
Chris,ah
Chris,I see the error now
Chris,Who the heck is using the Frostbite gamers Twitter account?

Chris,"in other words, they have a quota of ethnic diversity to meet"
Chris,"in other other words, time to get screwed for being white"
Chris,yo non-whites check your privilege
Chris,So what was that about white privilege again?
Chris,lol
Chris,"""Qualifications for employment, promotion, and other terms and conditions of employment are based upon the ability to perform the job.

Chris,THEN WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME IF IT WON'T AFFECT MY LIKELIHOOD BEING HIRED
Chris,"Because equality only applies to those who are not white straight males obviously, because we already have the whole of the white supremacist patriarchy on our side."
Chris,Things like this might be why the number of liberals decreases as age increases.
Chris,maybe
Chris,I think it's mostly just society moving left over time so the younger generations will be more left just by virtue of being born in a lefter time

Chris,Vote Now! [Hunter] [Priest] [Mage] [Shaman] [Warrior] [Paladin] [Warlock] [Rogue] [Druid] [Monk]
Chris,@Homies Looks like Nier Automata isn't part of the holiday sale.
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,should I buy skullgirls?
Chris,its 2 dollars
Chris,Its worth $2
Chris,Just know its very different from smash games
Chris,kk'
Chris,it's pretty good
Chris,but on the flip side neither me nor max is really playing it anymore
Chris,max just kinda isn't and I'm mostly playing blazblue and guilty gear
Chris,more things go on sale as the time passes
Chris,but it's good for if you're not sure if you'd like traditional 2D fighters and want to give it a shot
Chris,If you buy the game I'll pick it back up and learn a new character
Chris,My old main was garbage as a solo
Chris,eh yeah if you buy it and max picks it up again I will too
Chris,but if you main peacock I'm disowning you
Chris,any character where explaining how to get around their basic zoning takes more than six minutes is a character whose shit I refuse to put up with
Chris,"oh also you might be amused by this game just cause, at least until he picks a new main, my best character is more or less the best in the game and max chose one of the worst -_-"
Chris,*unknowingly
Chris,same on my end
Chris,"I just saw the guy who taught me playing them and went ""hot damn that looks sick"""
Chris,and my other character I mostly started playing cause they have a skin that makes them look just like my favourite character from persona 3
Chris,I picked my character because she has the least suggestive outfit
Chris,lol
Chris,"I still think it's pretty funny that of the two clone characters, one of whom is meh and the other is top tier you chose the lower tier one"
Chris,is skull girls sketch bois
Chris,define sketch?
Chris,FAN SERVICE
Chris,I mean yes
Chris,but they mix things up with it so that it's not pure fanservice
Chris,"like the character who's basically a bunch of limbs stitched together and can stretch those limbs out on individual tendons, throw her head at you, and wrap you in a ball of intenstines"
Chris,or the character who is literally just made out of blood
Chris,what the FUCK
Chris,or the unholy monstrosity that is my best character
Chris,thats fucking nasty
Chris,who is a shapeshifting undulating flesh blob
Chris,but there's plenty of characters with basically no fanservice
Chris,like big band
Chris,who is basically a ton of brass instruments in a trench coat
Chris,and with two on screen this is a thing that can happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qcjCnkbROY
Chris,skullgirls BigbandのTrumpetで東方U.N.オーエンは彼女なのか？を演奏

Chris,Is this a TAS?
Chris,yeah I think so
Chris,still great tho
Chris,and his lv5 super you have a little space to just jam out on the trumpet while time is stopped and if you end on the right four notes it activates
Chris,"brief history of why this is hilarious before I post the clip, in team fighting games, if you catch an assist and point character at the same time, it's known as a Happy Birthday"
Chris,"taken to its logical conclusion, https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyDepressedSpiderPeteZaroll"
Chris,KPBLive Playing Skullgirls - Twitch Clips
Chris,Happy Birthday - Clipped by MegaMissingn0
Chris,That is amazing
Chris,but in general it's not too hard to make teams where none of your characters are particularly fanservice-y
Chris,my current team is these two:
Chris,
Chris,and I'm probably gonna add either you
Chris,or you
Chris,"on the flip side you could always run eliza, valentine, and cerebella:"
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,but if you do that max's head might explode
Chris,I would also refuse to play against you except late at night
Chris,just you wait till I get you to play street fighter 5 and then pick up r mika
Chris,like seriously who thought this was reasonable
Chris,I've played street fighter and I thought it was super boring
Chris,it's mostly neutral
Chris,whereas sg is mostly punish
Chris,and I mostly just wanted to show that skullgirls isn't actually all that bad in terms of fanservice in fighting games
Chris,but I don't think I could bring myself to play someone whose design is that much shameless fanservice
Chris,I think the upshot of this whole discussion is you should all drop like $30 on guilty gear so we can learn together and I can fight you with a reasonably dressed girl who can summon motherfucking dolphins
Chris,I've seen that character
Chris,She looks pretty fun
Chris,"on top of which, playstyle-wise she's pretty much what I look for in a character - good zoning, but when you get in you can go ham"
Chris,"There is a chance I do buy it, but before I do, I want to have a conversation about the game."
Chris,I've only played like an hour
Chris,and only in tutorial and training mode
Chris,so I dunno if I can give a serious recommendation yet
Chris,i played the game for a bit i wasnt a fan adn refunded it
Chris,combos felt clunky
Chris,and hte punish game seems weak
Chris,every move is safe on block from what i could tell
Chris,from what I've heard the execution is reallllly tight
Chris,no idea about the safe on block bit
Chris,from watching it seems like there are definately safe block strings but they're not infinite
Chris,and this is a personal thing thid doesnt make the game bad but i prefer button block to directional block
Chris,i think i recall skullgirls had directional
Chris,but dont quote me
Chris,yeah it does
Chris,don't like... all fighting games?
Chris,at least all the ones I've played do
Chris,blazblue's got a weird mix
Chris,well i mostly play mortal kombat
Chris,i mean i still like fighting games that also have directional block like MvC
Chris,MvC is a crazy looking game
Chris,its a fucking nutty game
Chris,"never played it, but it feels a bit too much like two-touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, incoming mixup into one touch death, you win"
Chris,its more like
Chris,low sweep to uppercut knockup to 100-0 air juggle
Chris,i mostly just like the characters
Chris,love capcom and marvel so
Chris,combo of hte two always nice
Chris,my friend  plays the shit outta street fighter and i cant do shit agianst him
Chris,he mains ryu and im like hey man could you just play someone different so i dont get 100-0'd and he says yeah then swaps to ken
Chris,like thanks man he has the exact same moveset
Chris,lololol
Chris,apparently they're pretty different in sfv at least
Chris,but not... any other game really
Chris,ay apparently pubg is officially out of early access and they optimized a ton of stuff
Chris,yeah it is
Chris,it looks super good
Chris,its fun
Chris,I played so much last night
Chris,might take a stab at it again and see if my computer can handle it
Chris,@Trapezoider @Jed you man's are living together?
Chris,nah
Chris,I'm just at his house for 2 days

But, if you ask to use the machine, specifically to do some photocopying (ie, something that sounds like a reason but is actually just a redundant statement of what you do with a photocopier) the percentage of people who'll let you cut ahead jumps back up to 93%, only 1% less than if you give a valid reason"
Chris,if someone told me they were gonna use the photo copier to make spaghetti hell yeah im gonna let them go ahead of me i wanna see where hes going with this
Chris,"naw it's more like they go ""Can I use the photocopier? I need to make some copies."" and you're 33% more likely to let them use it than if they just ask ""Can I use the photocopier?"""
Chris,i like my version better
Chris,@The Rona due to the strike instead of my final math exam being cumulative of everything we've learned its only about logarithms and straight lines
Chris,ez marks
Chris,we couldn't even finish the logarithms unit so its only the easy logarithm stuff
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,In addition if you add the word because it increases your likelyhood i.e
Chris,"""I need to use the photocopier because I am in a rush and need to make copies"""
Chris,Are you in a psych class?
Chris,based on what the study was comparing (actually having a reason vs. having a sentence structure that sounds like a reason but isn't) that would be around the same as just saying that you're in a rush
Chris,naw I just stumbled across it
Chris,my fuckin family got one of those smart thermostats and so during the day when nobodys home the house is freezing to conserve energy but im fucking home during hte day they dont change it for the days i dont have college
Chris,why arent you back in school yet?
Chris,School isn't all day at university/ college
Chris,Dont you guys live on campus?
Chris,I thought you were dorm boys
Chris,dorm is really only a first-year thing in canada
Chris,Devon lives at home because the school is close
Chris,Dank
Chris,I go to a different school than him though
Chris,You go to waterloo right?
Chris,Yup
Chris,daNK
Chris,art thou in their coop stuff?
Chris,"Im in a ""Digital literacy class that is an absolute meme"
Chris,"cause they have like, the best co op in the country"
Chris,This is for people whomstve havent even used computers basically
Chris,plus you dont go to school everyday in college usually @Trapezoider
Chris,like i only have school 3 days a week
Chris,what
Chris,lucky bastard
Chris,There is a super attractive female next to me. Im gonna get her name tomorrow
Chris,Then number
Chris,I've always had five days a week
Chris,Welcome to college Sylki
Chris,Five days a week for me
Chris,but Im out by 1:30 everyday
Chris,I almost didn't this term but I had to move a course from first to second term so I'm right back on five days a week
Chris,welcome to mixing and matching your courses so you get a good schedule
Chris,and my stuff's mad spread out some days
Chris,although one of my days is 8-6
Chris,I'm not in a co-op program
Chris,I hate that shit
Chris,"today, I have 5 hours of class spread from 830am to 930pm"
Chris,I want all my classes to be back to back
Chris,I can still do it though if I want to
Chris,back to back classes is great
Chris,Wait doc you dont have females in your classes?
Chris,TF
Chris,"however, cause it's the first day of classes, I skipped my 830 cause they're just gonna go over the syllabus and I would only have had like 4 hours of sleep, and my 630-930 class got cancelled cause the prof has flu"
Chris,i have a 3 hour break on thursdays but me and my boys jsut go into town and get food during it
Chris,That's not what co-op means
Chris,lol
Chris,Thats what is means here
Chris,co op is mixed school and work terms
Chris,so you get a fuckton of experience by the time you graduate
Chris,im aware of what co-op menas
Chris,"It's basicly like an internship where you go an work for a company, but you get paid"
Chris,andrew isn't tho
Chris,Ive always heard it in referring to genders
Chris,Thats dank as fuck
Chris,im in the college with the #1 rated co-op program in ontario
Chris,oh
Chris,internships are actually paid pretty often
Chris,the terms are almost interchangeable at this point
Chris,just that internship can mean you don't get paid
Chris,true
Chris,you get paid in experience
Chris,yay
Chris,yeah but that blows
Chris,im gonna buy all the stuff with this experience ive earned
Chris,I ain't applying to no unpaid internships
Chris,what is the ratio of experience to bitcoins?
Chris,the same as the ratio of leprecauns to unicorns
Chris,http://puu.sh/yX1Jg/2cc62ab9e5.jpg
Chris,Anyone wanna buy .05 of a bitcoin
Chris,"thats like $10,000"
Chris,no
Chris,its $700 usd
Chris,no it really isnt
Chris,devon
Chris,"still, one thing I prefer from my school's internship stuff vs waterloo's coop is that waterloo does 4-month so you're basically in, trained, given some menial tasks for three months then booted out, whereas we do full-year stuff so you actually get better experience"
Chris,http://puu.sh/yX1L4/3087ec02dd.png
Chris,you are fucking wrong
Chris,"bitcoin are $15,000 usd"
Chris,"15,000 * .05 =$750"
Chris,What are you smoking?
Chris,he said .05 not .5
Chris,oh you said .05
Chris,DORK
Chris,not used to people not putting a 0 before hte decimal place
Chris,fucking americans
Chris,Those god damned yankees
Chris,that's not uncommon here
Chris,just not super common either
Chris,bruh i aint never seen it
Chris,wut
Chris,is the GTA just like a mini america inside ontario
Chris,Devon I can assure you that we have seen it
Chris,ye
Chris,cause dont you people call like chapstick blisterrods or something
Chris,basically
Chris,we also have aids here
Chris,lol not really
Chris,@The Rona well im sure if i actually looked at the board during math call i'd have seen it
Chris,also I've literally never heard the word 'blisterrod' in my life but it sounds horrible
Chris,what do you call chapsticks
Chris,isnt there like a wierd nickname
Chris,i could've sworn
Chris,"sometimes it goes by one of the brand names (blistex), like kleenex instead of tissues"
Chris,blistex

Chris,
Chris,max it means I left 3 hours after
Chris,and just got home because I got asked to go buy groceries
Chris,Still down?
Chris,I'm eating but I'll play after
Chris,GUYS! I NEED HELP! I feel like characters on the left are a stolen design of characters from the Fate Series. If you've seen the Fate series please help me out here!
Chris,"I mean, same hair eye color"
Chris,there are a few Fate parody type things
Chris,they might be from one of those
Chris,where did you find this?
Chris,"I made it myself, I took the left screenshots from an anime, I don't know the name of it, but the opening is called Apron Boy"
Chris,"When I first saw these characters, I initially thought it was an ending to a Fate anime, but then I saw that it was an opening and not even the same series"
Chris,is it from this? https://myanimelist.net/anime/37033/Emiya-san_Chi_no_Kyou_no_Gohan
Chris,Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan
Chris,A Fate/stay Night spin-off focused on cooking.
Chris,I think it is.
Chris,"well yeah, it's not stolen then it's just a spin-off"
Chris,besides I don't think character theft is a thing that happens in the anime industry
Chris,but what do I know
Chris,"Thanks for clearifying that, and I didn't think they were stealing the characters, I thought they were stealing the designs and naming them different characters"
Chris,"But one last thing I do find strange is that, Spin-Offs (or at least the ones I've seen) usually have a different cast of characters with members of the previous cast making side appearances. But I could be wrong"
Chris,I haven't seen many spin-offs so I don't really know. I guess there's just different ways to do it
Chris,maybe
Chris,@Trapezoider I'm ready
Chris,@Trapezoider We playing PUBG or not?
Chris,I'm cracking up
Chris,this kid I know from kingston used to play tf2
Chris,apparently
Chris,one of his teammates thought he was a girl
Chris,and was kinda sorta hitting on him constantly
Chris,which the kid didn't discourage
Chris,it eventually culminated in the guy buying the kid a csgo knife
Chris,he is living the trap dream
Chris,Did the guy ever find out?
Chris,yeah after awhile the kid felt kinda bad and told him and asked if he wanted the knife back
Chris,"to which the reply was basically 'naw you're a chill dude, keep it'"
Chris,wow what a guy
Chris,why give hte knife back
Chris,he scammed it fair and square
Chris,How expensive was the knife?
Chris,um
Chris,lemme check
Chris,"according to the steam market, $81.45"
Chris,Not bad
Chris,so like $65 usd
Chris,respectable scam
Chris,i used to scam people in warframe out of platinum
Chris,made like ~$200 worth of plat off it
Chris,I'm fufilling my namesake
Chris,Time to start scamming bibbas by fufilling mh destiny
Chris,Someone give me the trap tah

Chris,been reading for the last little while
Chris,and hoooly shit the plot twist
Chris,never have I ever seen such a comprehensive plot twist
Chris,something that somehow seeped into like... everything
Chris,What are you reading?
Chris,it's part of an unfinished series (book 3 of an eventual 10)
Chris,"The Stormlight Archives, by Brandon Sanderson (my favourite author, and probably his best series thus far)"
Chris,fucking impressive plot twist
Chris,it was even the kind of thing where it's like 'there is going to be a plot twist about this'
Chris,but I was not expecting anything like this
Chris,@deleted-role
Chris,maybe?
Chris,sure
Chris,"there's a kazahkstanian csgo player whos name is Jame ""Jame"" Jame"

Chris,db6385d8
Chris,@Max

Chris,So my parents can leave
Chris,okay
Chris,join when ready
Chris,kk
Chris,what matchups do you wanna do
Chris,When your parents leave can you join voice?
Chris,also is genesis tomorrow
Chris,No I can play
Chris,Wen I went down
Chris,They told me not to play games
Chris,So I gotta wait
Chris,Genesis is this weekend
Chris,early events may start thursday or friday though
Chris,I am probably going to start on falco
Chris,kk
Chris,After that we can play Shiek Falcon
Chris,kk
Chris,@Max
Chris,yeah?
Chris,"random thought - we have the term 'shot dead' for someone who is shot, and dies from it, but we don't have similar terms for other ways of dying or getting killed"
Chris,no 'stabbed dead' or 'drowned dead' or 'heart attacked dead'
Chris,english is weird
Chris,we're the only language where a double positive can result in a negative
Chris,wait how
Chris,yeah right
Chris,lol
Chris,I will still hold up verbal quebecois french as the most comprehensive idiomatic butchering of a language
Chris,four twenties ten 
Chris,naw that's just the language
Chris,I'm aware
Chris,I'm talking more the degree to which they mash english in and randomly remove syllables
Chris,fuck saying 'petit' (small) let's just say 'tit
Chris,"fuck saying 'voiture' (car), two syllables is too many let's just use the english word for it"
Chris,le tit snow
Chris,"also, in some rural regions in quebec they just randomly add 'la la' to the end of every sentence despite it having no semantic meaning within the sentence"
Chris,also they invented a completely separate set of swear words
Chris,which results in some truly unique cussing that you just don't really get to see in english
Chris,"because they'll mash together quebecois swearing, french swearing, and english swearing"
Chris,cause each language's/dialect's swearing has different stuff that's considered swearing so you can get really inventive
Chris,I've almost paid for pubg by selling crates
Chris,Nice
Chris,How much dollar
Chris,I haven't been playing since the update so no crates for me
Chris,Also Jed can you hang this weekend irl?
Chris,I'm at like $20
Chris,and idk
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,yikes
Chris,Were you heavily invested in cryptocurrencies @Trapezoider ?
Chris,what caused the crypto bubble to finally burst?
Chris,"dammit. I had a controller coming in for a bunch of fighting game stuff, was supposed to arrive tomorrow, but they showed up today only no one was home cause it wasn't supposed to come till tomorrow so they just took it back till tomorrow"
Chris,it literally changed nothing from my expectations but I could have had it tonight and that makes me mad
Chris,"fuck you too psychology, why'd you invent loss aversion"
Chris,I'm not sure whats happening today but I just had a perfect game in rivals the other guy didn't even touch me
Chris,everything seemed really slow
Chris,"I've only ever had one such game. They are rare and special, I hope you enjoyed it."
Chris,so I put a sandwich in the toster oven (wanted to heat the insides too)
Chris,"the top slice of bread, the one exposed to the air, burned to a crisp"
Chris,"the bottom one, the one pressed against the hot metal?"
Chris,"lightly toasted, slightly damp"
Chris,I do not understand thermodynamics
Chris,@Trapezoider Still interested in melee tonight?
Chris,duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude
Chris,"I just won a solo
I dropped gun range and went to bunker but someone was there so I went for a uaz
but a dude was already in it so I said wait no can I get a ride with you and he stopped and let me in and he was like where are you from and he was chinese and it worked so perfectly like we ran at the last guy and he died and then the other guy got zone boned"

Chris,also let this be a lesson to work on your mentality
Chris,if you took my lessons seriously you would be way better
Chris,mentality isn't a joke
Chris,if you don't mind getting bodied you'll play way better
Chris,was a huge turning point for me
Chris,I mind getting bodied by someone who has been playing for 1/32 the amount of time I have
Chris,huge ego destruction
Chris,"like if you watch the handful of sets I'm on stream, I'm laughing at myself and me getting bodied and silly things"
Chris,going in with a positive attitude literally makes everything better
Chris,be happy for the other person doing sick stuff to you
Chris,"and afterwards consider what you could have done better, what worked, and what didn't"
Chris,keep the negativity for analyzing yourself later
Chris,The reason you are not good with your number of hours is because your hours are not meaningful. They are just random friendlies. You don't watch as many tournaments as Kameron (which I consider to be very important) so he knows how top level players move and combo. He also takes advice all the time while you just want to play a specific way and are too stubborn.
Chris,@Mr. Airplane I challenge you to a best of 9 set january 27th at 11pm EST
Chris,why an even number

Chris,including egg yolk
Chris,which has sunk into the fabric
Chris,this backpack is officially fucked
Chris,I guess instead of getting work done and going to office hours I'm instead going to have to go way out of my way to somewhere they sell backpacks and get a new one
Chris,RIP Sylki's backpack~ Unknown-2018
Chris,amazon same day delivery
Chris,I'm barely gonna be home today and if you miss the delivery stuff gets weird here
Chris,and I'd have ot go way out of my way to the UPS place to pick it up
Chris,Here they just leave it at the door
Chris,Same
Chris,unless its something super expensive like a phone
Chris,student housing is too sketchy for that here
Chris,like anything could get stolen

Chris,Sweet. I'll review those on my lunch break
Chris,Sylki do you ever miss classes?
Chris,occasionally
Chris,I don't recommend it
Chris,my basic rule is I will skip review classes of stuff I already know really well or early morning classes if I get less than 5 hours of sleep
Chris,or classes where the prof is so legendarily awful that it's easier and faster to skip the class and read the slides
Chris,That's a good rule to follow. I had to miss one today and I kinda wanted To die.
Chris,Ugh my teachers are lazy and don't make slides
Chris,just make sure yoou catch up on what you missed
Chris,Thankfully we have blackboard and I can do everything from I class online. Do you guys use blackboard?
Chris,nope

Chris,Brb
Chris,dem custom skins are wack
Chris,true
Chris,mostly don't look like what they say they look like
Chris,also it'll take one hell of a skin to make me give up on my coral kragg
Chris,coral krag?
Chris,
Chris,@Trapezoider coral kragg
Chris,I always get a bit sad looking at the really nice custom skins I have for characters I never play -_-
Chris,god this assignment is annoying
Chris,"""There is no solution to this. Just try to find the closest thing you can."""
Chris,and it's not like math where you can get an answer that still has some variables in it
Chris,there's literally no way to get from the starting point to an equivilant - if vague - end point
Chris,@here games?
Chris,maybe in a bit I've got a bit more work to do
Chris,cool-cool
Chris,
Chris,@Zain I'll preorder as soon as you do
Chris,but I thought you had to preorder it before the closed beta started
Chris,but idk
Chris,@SWIRL GIRL if you pre order now you get into the closed beta everyone is playing right now but I don't think am gonna buy it cuz it ends in like 2 days I'll prob buy it when I comes out
Chris,I have found a kragg skin that I would replace my coral kragg with
Chris,shame you have to buy it
Chris,
Chris,Now I'm hungry.
Chris,Yeah burrito kragg is cool
Chris,oh also kameron a top etalus confirmed with me that orcane beats etalus
Chris,no word on orcane kragg yet though
Chris,Once you get to the top tho matchups matter less
Chris,Still true tho
Chris,I somehow ended up in a weird roa discord for ontario/quebec and it seems pretty chill
Chris,also we might be entering a crew in a tournament where the winning team gets burrito kragg skins
Chris,I doubt I'm good enough to be on the crew though
Chris,What's the name of it?
Chris,it's only for ontario/quebec people
Chris,so I doubt you're in it
Chris,Aight
Chris,Just know there's a crew tourny coming up that my crews gonna be in
Chris,aight now I have to try to get into this crew if it's the same tournament
Chris,I want to die
Chris,I just spent 20 minutes debugging a four-line program
Chris,how
Chris,the problem was I used the wrong kind of quotation marks
Chris,...
Chris,"' ' instead of "" """
Chris,fuck haskell
Chris,like if its 4 lines id literally jsut rewrite hte htiung
Chris,I did
Chris,it still didn't work
Chris,cause apparently haskell's picky about your quotation marks
Chris,but the error message won't tell you that htat's the problem
Chris,it was telling me the problem was on the line after that
Chris,well i mean wanting you to actually use quotation marks rather than apostrophes isnt really picky
Chris,every other language I've ever used doesn't care
Chris,they've always been the same thing
Chris,but now they're not
Chris,and I can't tell what the actual difference is
Chris,i spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why my program kept skipping an input and realized i have a buffer overflow
Chris,ah that's always fun
Chris,@Rivals of Aether GOML 2018 might have RoA
Chris,Nice
Chris,anyone who might show if it does? cause apparently they're trying to gauge interest atm

Chris,Yeah it's not exclusive to canada
Chris,didn't think it was?

Chris,I'm in a crew @Sak von Sak

Chris,could you?
Chris,when is it?
Chris,it's spread over next week
Chris,presumably in the evenings
Chris,we probably won't need you but you have to sign up with four and a sub
Chris,"sure, I guess I'll sub. I'm not that good at the game though so if I do play I'll probably lose"

Chris,need to finish a lab and shower but after that I'd be down
Chris,how long do you think thatll be?
Chris,hour or two
Chris,not sure how long the lab's gonna take
Chris,"and especially because it's a programming thing built around a concept I've never actually used before, it could be super simple or take ages"
Chris,this is some of the worst debugging I've ever written
Chris,there's so much redundant stuff
Chris,but it was useful like half an hour ago
Chris,and I'm afraid to delete it in case it becomes useful half an hour from now
Chris,@Melee I got invited to the Icons closed beta! I'm under NDA though so please don't ask me questions about the game.
Chris,what is nda
Chris,non disclosure agreement
Chris,Also what is this game?

Chris,Max is that the good news?

Chris,"I've been debugging this for an hour and a half and it's a constant 'one step forwards, two steps back'"
Chris,you know what I always say @Sak von Sak
Chris,programming isn't real
Chris,I feel you
Chris,the sooner you realize this the sooner you can accept it
Chris,yo the rivals character select screen is organised by element type
Chris,totally just realised that

Chris,I knew that
Chris,And I don't play
Chris,shhh\
Chris,@Jed you wanna try out that weird version of rivals with me?
Chris,sure
Chris,"alright, technically I can beat jed"
Chris,"practically, it takes like 15 tries and a lot of salt"
Chris,ranno's jank
Chris,so are platforms
Chris,but not at the same time
Chris,the count was 11-3 or
Chris,but some of those were sylvanos
Chris,yeah at least one of them was us seeing if sylvanos jab spikes
Chris,and you killed yourself three times in like twenty seconds
Chris,oh true
Chris,"still, once I was more warmed up we had close matches"
Chris,I would have won that one kragg one if I hadn't killed myself by fastfalling next to the stage instead of onto it at like 20%
Chris,Icons is fun

Chris,are the numbers you chose for peoples id's random or do they have meaning
Chris,My plan was to never actually mention what someones number was but others have given specific numbers. I would guess that they are random but you should check with whoever wrote the chapter.
Chris,okay just making sure no one has some foreshadowing on those numbers or a purpose to them
Chris,In college business class
Chris,professor asks someone to give description of what supply and demand means

Chris,And was also funded and researched by a private citizen
Chris,cant wait till spaceman makes it to mars
Chris,Im so curious if the mainfcore made it to the drone ship
Chris,Im checking every news feed possible and space
Chris,x'x twitter but no one has news
Chris,I NEED TO KNOW
Chris,Do you guys get why im such an elon fan now?
Chris,Yeah how long till the core comes down?

Chris,Send me your emails or send me your availability
Chris,I am creating the DC calendar
Chris,Let's get these dates locked down ASAP
Chris,dont you already know mine?
Chris,Ye but send me your schedule
Chris,For summer
Chris,@Zain @Feral Nebula @Trapezoider @Sak von Sak @Mr. Airplane @The Rona The spreadsheet has been made and should be in your email
Chris,"So bros, my parents track my phone and are super oedipal and annoying about knowing where I am. Today however I found a very convienient app that can spoof my location. :) Life just got a lot better"
Chris,lol gg dude
Chris,
Chris,on a scale from 1 to tm06 how toxic is this
Chris,@Homiesgames?
Chris,"andrew, I feel for you and all, but I'm pretty sure oedipal is not the right word"
Chris,oedipus (or however you spell it) was the guy who banged his mum and killed his dad
Chris,I'm gonna assume you just meant anal
Chris,"as in anal retentitive, as in super control-freak-y"
Chris,if you can spoof your location you can fool your parents but also think of how easy it would be to play pokemon go
Chris,@here games?
Chris,shut the heck up
Chris,ok
Chris,"apparently, if every chicken dinner in pubg was an actual chicken dinner, enough have occurred that you could feed the population of iceland for a year"
Chris,I don't know who goes through the trouble of figuring this stuff out
Chris,but it's great
Chris,@Sak von Sak melee or pubg or somethin?
Chris,naw studying atm
Chris,kk
Chris,got midterms next week
Chris,@Sak von Sak post that canada pic about the population
Chris,what if he don't
Chris,i cri
Chris,I don't have it
Chris,it was never me
Chris,pretty sure ocean man's got it
Chris,@Sak von Sak pretty sure oedipal was the word I was looking for. In my context it means the helicopter mother and father who are emotionally dependant on me and take away responsibility I should have for myself by being over protective and over bearing
Chris,dude raisins are gay
Chris,craisins however
Chris,NUT
Chris,but that's not what happened in the story
Chris,
Chris,he was abandoned
Chris,I'm not talking about the story????
Chris,cause prophecy saying he'd kill his dad and murder his mum
Chris,It's a word from frued
Chris,but that's where the term comes from?
Chris,he used it in the context of the story
Chris,Pretty sure it's from civilization and it's discontents
Chris,oedipos complex is freud's thing
Chris,Oedipos and oedipal are different
Chris,http://www.dictionary.com/browse/oedipal
Chris,the definition of oedipal
Chris,https://youtu.be/EPAfS8-wm8g
Chris,Jordan Peterson: Female Pathology (The Oedipal Mother)
Chris,Full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek
Chris,I think we're having a definitional mismtach here
Chris,I need to update my knowledge of this topic
Chris,'spose they're different meanings for the same word
Chris,I was running off that video essentially
Chris,"but in common perception, oedipus-related stuff immediately goes the mother-fucking route"
Chris,LOL
Chris,a statement which is based in a different psychologist's work -_-
Chris,"Yeah I read your definition and I was like ""fuuuuccckk"""
Chris,Basically sees his dad as a sexual rival lmao
Chris,jung get out of our freud-based discussion dammit
Chris,That's fucked up dude
Chris,Yeah get the fuck out Jung
Chris,eh I like Jung's stuff honestly
Chris,who tf is Jung?
Chris,Fucking coming in here with your collective unconscience
Chris,Stupid bitch
Chris,"well the main thing is the idea of the collective unconscience, which is ironically usually misunderstood"
Chris,Jed he was essentially Sigmund Freud 2.0
Chris,aight
Chris,"the way jung has it is that it's the collection of ideas, archetypes, and such that are common to basically everyone - symbols that pretty much everyone will understand and associate with the same things"
Chris,"amusingly, the collective unconscience is often represented as a literal collective, shared part of the uncounscious mind that is in some way attached between people"
Chris,so the collective unconscience isn't really a part of the collective unconscience
Chris,"also Jung and Freud were pretty different in how they approached stuff, from what I remember"
Chris,although Jung did carry on some of Freud's stuff I'm pretty sure mmost of his theories were pretty different
Chris,it's been awhile since I took psych so I'm gonna go dig this up
Chris,While we wait for sylkis notes
Chris,@Rivals of Aether Jed?
Chris,for a little bit
Chris,sylki do you know a rivals player named sableye?
Chris,he is in Ontario I think
Chris,he's in that discord but other than that I dunno
Chris,aight
Chris,@Trapezoider get in nerd
Chris,"they both worked a lot with the unconscious, but Freud focused more on repressed, but still present stuff, as well as the id/ego/superego stuff and the kinda wacky psychosexual stuff for describing behaviour, whereas Jung focused more on the shared stuff between people, how we understand society and ourselves in relation to it"
Chris,sadly one of the major reasons I remember as much about Jung as I do is that the persona games kinda swooped in and built a lot of the series off his theories (especially Personas 4&5) - Jung is literally the guy who came up with the term 'Persona' in the way that it's generally used today

Chris,I dont know what certifications are in canada
Chris,But here in the states
Chris,EZ
Chris,only have my bronze medal and TBH im not fit enough to get the cross rn
Chris,oh in canada you need to complete 3 seperate 12 week courses
Chris,so ive done two
Chris,havent finished the third
Chris,for lifeguard shit?
Chris,Damn canada
Chris,yeah
Chris,well its your job to ensure safety of the public
Chris,Mine was one week of training/testing for certifcations
Chris,so id assume it'd be pretty hard
Chris,really?
Chris,damn america is wack
Chris,How long are the sessions?
Chris,2 hours
Chris,It was 8 hours a day for 5 days
Chris,but only once a week
Chris,oh
Chris,okay it comes out similar then
Chris,America is retarded but definitely not that retarded
Chris,"2x12x3=72
8x5=40"
Chris,TIL you cant use * to show multiplication on discord
Chris,Ye i just checked my calculator because something didnt seem right with me saying they were close
Chris,32 hour difference
Chris,LYike
Chris,TBH you can easily cover it all in 32 hours especially if you have them back to back
Chris,so its not that wack
Chris,40*
Chris,my issue i couldn't finish was hte distance swim
Chris,i mean i did finish it
Chris,but barely
Chris,how long?
Chris,300 m right?
Chris,1600m in 12 mins
Chris,did you have to do the brick?
Chris,100m pool 16 lengths
Chris,oh yeah the brick was fine
Chris,Brick = ez
Chris,the brick was weird cause you could jsut stand on the bottom
Chris,without floating back up
Chris,TF?
Chris,We did it in the deep end
Chris,yeah no im saying
Chris,when you are at the bottom of the pool usually you float up
Chris,@Max Melee?
Chris,but with the brick you can just stay on the bottom
Chris,so it felt weird
Chris,Oh yeah
Chris,I like chilling on the bottom with the brick
Chris,same
Chris,Sneaky snekking my way around
Chris,Grabbing peoples legs
Chris,we always had to cram the swimming stuff in the first hour cause for the second hour the synchro team would take like half hte pool
Chris,so it meant even when our instructor was just talking to us we had to focus on not sinking since we could only have the deep end
Chris,Are you going to complete your certs?
Chris,i really should
Chris,@Trapezoider how do I aquire such a test drive
Chris,go on the website and apply
Chris,here ill send link
Chris,wait shit you have to be 21. I need to cancel 
Chris,Lmao
Chris,Rip
Chris,finishing your certs isn't that that hard
Chris,so long as you have decent eggbeater you're fine
Chris,I got mine and then never managed to actually get a lifeguarding job -_-
Chris,now they're pretty much all expired
Chris,I'd have to do all the hardest ones all over again
Chris,mango is at the cs_summit
Chris,eggbeater?
Chris,treading water with legs only technique
Chris,super useful for carrying people
Chris,especially for spinals where you have to move at a constant pace or risk causing way more damage
Chris,@Trapezoider for spinals do they teach the Canadian hold thingy in the states?
Chris,.+
Chris,for spinals we actually use a backboard and try to stabilize as best we can until the backboard can be used
Chris,The goal is to get the person into shallow water and maintain stability of the spinal erector and neck
Chris,Since we dont really know the extent of a given injury
Chris,Man sylki you and I become more and more similar the more i get to know you
Chris,
Chris,wait did they not teach you spinal carry stuff for before you can get them to the board?
Chris,They did but I dont remember 
Chris,dammit now I don't get to know if they taught you canadian carry
Chris,which they'd better have cause it's the best
Chris,I have no idea :(
Chris,

Chris,actually I cant play at all
Chris,highest HP boss in the history of gaming:
Chris,
Chris,I see your boss and raise you http://xenoblade.wikia.com/wiki/Gradivus%2C_the_Headless_Emperor
Chris,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor"
Chris,"Gradivus, the Headless Emperor (Japanese: 首無皇帝グラデウス, Kubinashi Kōtei Guradeusu) is a Tyrant in Xenoblade Chronicles X. It is a member of the Millesaur family. It can be found at level 71 at the..."
Chris,"100,000,040 health"
Chris,also for the record this is a lv71 enemy in a game where the level cap is 60
Chris,i see your boss and I raise you again (i found this on reddit)
Chris,also where'd the extra 40 come from on that xenoblade boss?
Chris,no idea
Chris,but that is its health
Chris,the post-game bosses in this game are stupidly strong
Chris,cause there's a lot of weird optimization stuff
Chris,there's a boss that's 39 levels above the level cap
Chris,ie a lv99 when your max level is 60
Chris,that I can understand a little because they wanted to make it like other RPGs where the level cap is 99
Chris,"I tried taking it on as a joke at lv56, I got one shot"
Chris,tpk in one hit
Chris,you have to optimize so hard to win
Chris,I remember one time I took on a boss (which I didn't think was a secret boss) at a low level and I got one shot. I took me about three days to realize that he actually was a secret boss.
Chris,"I generally try to stay away from RPGs that require the use of so many complicated game mechanics (like optimizations, synthesising, equipment boosting, etc). Most of the ones I play have them, but I can ignore them and still manage to beat the game (main story at least)."
Chris,main story's totally manageable without any particular optimization
Chris,but they left some crazy stuff in for the crazy people
Chris,so they'd have some ridiculous completionist challenge
Chris,"yeah. For me, I just really only play games for their story aspect. If I really enjoyed it I'll go back and try to 100% it."
Chris,"same, but I do think it's cool"
Chris,also the particular crazy enemies are super interesting in terms of design and lore in this game
Chris,"intersting. I've never tried a Xenoblade game, but now I'm curious. Any recommandations to start with?"
Chris,start with the original
Chris,if you've got a wiiu/switch I think you can get it on the virtual console
Chris,xbc1 is one of my top 2 rpgs
Chris,I don't have a wiiu or a switch
Chris,ooooor you can just emulate it
Chris,unless you want to pay like $100 for a wii copy
Chris,yeha no thanks
Chris,xbcx is pretty good but it's more worldbuilding and sidequests than a direct story
Chris,haven't played xbc2 cause I don't have a switch
Chris,"also I don't know how the timeline of xbc1 and 2 work, but xbcx is totally separate"
Chris,is xb a wiiu/switch specific game?
Chris,it's nintendo specific
Chris,ah that explains it
Chris,"original was wii, X was wiiu, 2 is switch"
Chris,I'm really more of a ps fan
Chris,have you played any of the persona games?
Chris,I wanted to play persona 4 but I wasn't old enough when it came out. I DESPERATELY want to play Persona 5! I looks SOO COOL!
Chris,god p5 is good
Chris,it's the other of my two favourite rpgs
Chris,if you've got ps3 I think there's versions of personas 3-5
Chris,"p3 has versions for ps2, ps3, and psp, p4 for ps2 and ps3, and p5 for ps3 and ps4"
Chris,i have both a 3 and a 4 so I'm kinda in luck
Chris,yeee get p5
Chris,I'm trying to
Chris,is it hard to find a copy? or just not enough money?
Chris,not enough money
Chris,aw
Chris,just starve yourself for a week
Chris,it's worth it
Chris,lol
Chris,"btw, if you like persona 5, are you going to watch the animation coming out soon? Just curious?"
Chris,yup
Chris,"if possible I'd recommend playing before watching, the adaptations are a little less deep"
Chris,and especially in the case of p4 the pacing's wack
Chris,that is if they don't change the story progression first
Chris,both adaptations have been pretty faithful
Chris,I remember one of my favorite games got an anime adaption and it complete changed how the game was
Chris,slight changes to accomadate the protagonist not being a player-insert character
Chris,"but other than that, consistent"
Chris,admittadly the faithfulness is what caused the p4 adaptation to be weirdly paced
Chris,well yeah they kinda have to cram the possibly 20+ hour game into a 12 episode season
Chris,that sounds like it would end badly
Chris,"i wouldn't if they divided it over 2 seasons, which the anime adaption of my favorite game did but poorly"
Chris,20+ hours should probably be 50 episodes at least
Chris,"most likely, but you got to think, most of that time is possibly running around looking for what your doing, travel time, and filler content"
Chris,true
Chris,so theoetically it would really be 10-15 hours
Chris,"with persona games pre-5, they were like 60ish hours but a lot (probably 20-25 hours) was storyless combat, and they always have to trim side stuff (which is a lot of persona games), but they manage to fit just about all the important stuff in"
Chris,and that's what important. Though I don't mind the occational filler episode since they're the funniest
Chris,p4's got great filler
Chris,"cause it's so character focused, it doesn't even feel like filler"
Chris,I don't even know why you would put filler in a movie
Chris,movie where'd that come from? (and you wouldn't)
Chris,Persona 4's adaptation is a movie I think?
Chris,no it's an anime
Chris,naw that's backwards
Chris,"p4 is a 25 episode anime, p3 is 4(?) movies"
Chris,"but yeah, fillers can be good, as long as they progress the story or develop the characters even a little amongest all the fan service"
Chris,one of the p3 movies has one of the best hot springs bit I've ever seen
Chris,there's plenty of character development but it's also just funny
Chris,and not much fanservice
Chris,one of my favorite fan service bits from a game was a hot springs bonus scene from a game called Tales of Xillia 2. Oh my god it's freaking hallarious! You really don't even need to understand the game to think it's funny
Chris,basically what happens is the guys are swallowed by this living doll (that's actualyl a party member) because the girls didn't want them around. And they end up getting digested in the doll's stomach. It's the dialogue that makes it funny

Chris,on some non trapezoid yt
Chris,kk
Chris,just got in like a ten minute argument of me vs the majority of the ontario rivals discord about discord light vs discord dark
Chris,I have successfully convinced them that it's ok to use the light theme
Chris,so now hopefully no one's gonna get on my case for using it
Chris,Fuck you Sylki. I do not like you because you use white discord
Chris,that's racist
Chris,you don't like me cause I like white
Chris,"in all seriousness there are valid arguments against white, but 'it's too bright it hurts my eyes' is BS"
Chris,"it's the exact same white as like, everything else on your computer"
Chris,"behold, a screenshot of discord, where part of the picture is a screenshot of a word document"
Chris,IT'S THE EXACT SAME COLOUR
Chris,Ack! My eyes!
Chris,It burns
Chris,^
Chris,thai food is dope
Chris,uwu
Chris,Thai food is infact dope
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,Join the master race. Discord white is superior and all of the discord dark people can  kiss my ass
Chris,ew gross I didnt know you used discord light
Chris,we're not friends anymore
Chris,eat ass
Chris,no
Chris,go die
Chris,smoke grass
Chris,
Chris,and sled fast
Chris,
Chris,"""Sled fast, eat ass"" - Dan the Meme man"
Chris,"brief reasons why I use discord light:
1) anyone who says it's too bright is fucking stupid. It's the same white as everything else on your computer that uses white - word, facebook, google, etc. - and you can clearly manage it just fine there.
2) my eyes are borked and reading light text on dark background gives me brutal headaches if I do it for too long, which happened a bunch when I tried out discord dark.
These are objective facts. You can say you think discord dark looks better and that's fine, but don't try to tell me that it's too bright and don't tell me I should give myself brutal headaches to match your aesthetic sense."
Chris,Why do guys care about this so much?
Chris,It doesn't even matter.
Chris,except I have applied a dark skin to a majority of my web services
Chris,^
Chris,"I only care cause any time I put a screenshot up everyone goes 'ew discord light' and I feel victimized, you monsters"
Chris,and I always have discord up on my other monitor so it does tend to feel bright
Chris,so I feel the need to explain that due to actual physical problems discord light is better for me
Chris,There is nothing wrong with light
Chris,also I get annoyed at the 'it's too bright' thing
Chris,yeah that's fair
Chris,light's not right
Chris,but people like trap who just use it cause they are dumb
Chris,thats who we can make fun of
Chris,I still think it's dumb to make fun of people for preferring a different visual style
Chris,unelss they think ping pong the animation looks good
Chris,in which case hell yeah I'll make fun of them
Chris,hypocrisy intensifies

Ok everyone I know drowned in pools"
Chris,wait actually Dad made top 24
Chris,I'm not quite sure how because based on the bracket he just randomly appeared in loser's round of 24 and then lost 2-3
Chris,"he's not in any round before that, in winner's or loser's"
Chris,this bracket's super weird
Chris,it looks like a few people I know made it out of pools
Chris,but they all seem to appear in the main bracket at different places

Chris,you're need to create an object to call the method

Chris,@Zain @Bitmin We are going to be playing a new social deception game later tonight if either of you wants to join
Chris,it's hella fun you should join us
Chris,I'll hopefully be able to acquire a working mic by then
Chris,is it coup
Chris,yup
Chris,Can I join too?
Chris,sure
Chris,depending on how many we get we may need to split into two groups
Chris,is there a maximum number of players?
Chris,more than 4 would be awkward I think
Chris,you can't play with more than 7 but at that point it's a complete and total mess
Chris,why?
Chris,more than 4/5 would be hard
Chris,I want to keep it civil
Chris,"too many things to keep track of the more people you add, also you start running out of cards"
Chris,I think that having more people would be better because you can use the cards people have discarded by dying to try and figure out if someone's lying or not
Chris,The more players there are the less turns you get and the less each player matters
Chris,also you can't use cards people died and left behind
Chris,i suppose thats true
Chris,Okay but boys whats up with this http://puu.sh/zxS8Y/c9282f5e8f.png

Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture. One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.

When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school, while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends. Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the shadows of his past.

Chris,time to pray for lenient prof
Chris,I have a 12% assignment due tonight that I've been brick walling since monday
Chris,but I've missed office hours because I'm sick
Chris,so I'm totally fucked
Chris,I sent him an email and hopefully he'll extend it for me or just drop it entirely
Chris,but we'll see
Chris,Good luck my dude
Chris,How fooked are you if he doesnt help you out here?
Chris,What class is this for?
Chris,"it's scientific computing, which is a brutal class (super wacky linear algebra mixed with programming)"
Chris,and I'm really fucked if he doesn't help me out
Chris,because I was super duper behind and got a 0 on the previous assignment and a 0 on the previous test
Chris,like I'm currently failing the course
Chris,not because I don't get it but because I fell super far behind last time I was sick
Chris,"Sylki, I'm here for you my man. If you need to study for a test thats like memorization stuff I'll do online flash card review with you. I don't know the concepts but I can question you on then if you give me a review packet. Also can you give me a basic rundown on what linear algebra is, how it different from normal algebra, and what's it's current applications in computer science are? I have heard a lot of the deep mind guys talk about linear algebra having direct technical uses in machine learning"
Chris,"For optimizing ""fitness functions."" I barely understand any of this shit, so please enlighten my .0001% understanding"
Chris,Linear algebra is about vectors
Chris,In layman terms
Chris,"Okay the only context I understand vectors in is when closed cycle rocket engine ""vectors"" it's thrust to change directions"
Chris,Is there any analogy you can draw from that to the maths?
Chris,Its mostly about representing linear equations from what I understand
Chris,yes but that's a super simple way of thinking about it
Chris,it's basically super wack math that's not really analogous to anything else at the point I'm at
Chris,"in terms of usage, it's really good for machine learning and data analysis"
Chris,sylki any word from your prof?

This game should appeal to a much wider audience, so even if you didn't like MCG, I would appreciate if you gave this one a try. The game will be having its first playtest tonight. Anyone who wants in please let me know!"
Chris,Sure I can be there.
Chris,what time?
Chris,"No defined time yet, I will provide an update on the time once I have a better idea how much longer production is going to take."
Chris,@everyone Development of Combo Colors is now complete. I'm aiming to have the playtest at 6:30 CST so try to show up around then if you want to try it out.
Chris,"Just so you know, this game is not strictly a 1v1 game. It can be played with 2-4 players."

Chris,Tfw you think you're getting tinitus but then you track the high pitched ringing sound to your refrigerator
Chris,LOL
Chris,that is such a thing I would do
Chris,Tfw you've always had tinitus and thought that everyone else did too
Chris,How would you even figure out that everyone else doesn't?
Chris,I mentioned it to my mom one time like last year and she was like oh yeah that's not normal
Chris,Hey that's how I figured out it was a problem that I mostly only looked out of one eye
Chris,"Dominant eye is a thing, but it's not supposed to be that dominant"
Chris,But I didn't realize that until I told someone about it
Chris,how do you only look out of one eye ??
Chris,Long years of unintentionally trainin myself
Chris,Probably stemming from having had a lazy eye when I was really young
Chris,I've had to manually retrain myself the last two ish years
Chris,And its kinda sucked (lots of headaches)
Chris,But I'm pretty much fixed now except when I start to get really tired or spend too much time frequently changing focus
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,I shouldnt expect to have this correctly?
Chris,How do I test if I do?
Chris,Itd probably cost you but you could get it checked out by an optometrist
Chris,"In general though, you should be aware of the ability to swap focus between each of your eyes while pretty much completely ignoring the other, and a difficulty using both at once"
Chris,"A good simple test - hold two pencils out in front of your nose, one roughly 8-10 inches away and the other 2-3 times that. Focus on the close one, and in your non-focused field of view you should see two versions of the far pencil. Don't worry of this doesn't pop up immediately or if it's hard to look for the split while keeping your focus on the close one, worry if you can't do it at all or if it's really hard to get the split."
Chris,It's not a perfect test but it's something I had to train myself to be able to do and apparently it's a pretty normal thing most people can do
Chris,is it good or bad to get the split?
Chris,Good
Chris,Cause that means both eyes are focused up close
Chris,it happens pretty much automatically for me
Chris,"And since they both have different angles to the far one, it creates the split"
Chris,Yeah you're fine then
Chris,"Out of curiosity, are you able to unsplit while keeping your focus close (ie doing what I used to do automatically)"
Chris,let me try
Chris,no not really
Chris,the only way to remove the split is to focus on the far one
Chris,that's super weird
Chris,"Well that's good, odds are you'll never fall into the same trap I did"
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,Seems like im good
Chris,Thank you for all the insight
Chris,Are you close to being fully healed?
Chris,More or less
Chris,It still kicks I occasionally and a few things with it are still messed up (including the reading white text on dark background thing) but overall it's pretty much better

Chris,Did anyone know that Doki Doki Literature Club is getting a second game?
Chris,"whaaat, I didn't"
Chris,is it official?
Chris,"Not yet, but Game Theroy made two videos breaking down Doki Doki and they concluded that it's getting a second game in 2018"
Chris,Based on Doki Doki's hidden backstory
Chris,I dunno if Game Theory has the authority to declare something like that 100%
Chris,More like gay theory tho
Chris,He wasn't the one who came up with it though. It was a whole ARG that people solved
Chris,"It's actually really cool and I'm super excited if this is true, which it most likely will be since they're pretty accurate with their theories"
Chris,@mrd256 can you link the vid?

Chris,it's kindof an eyesore
Chris,"either ariel, calibri, or cambria should be the primary font for scholarly works"
Chris,not times new roman
Chris,also 1.1-1.3 line spacing is much more asthetically pleasing than 1.5-2 line spacing
Chris,I'm a fan of Calibri myself.

Chris,bless
Chris,cause this book is super boring dude
Chris,hey
Chris,i need some weeb peoples opinions
Chris,@Feral Nebula @mrd256
Chris,so like we're having this debate
Chris,theres a lot more weebs than that here
Chris,do you think it was possible for hte people in SaO
Chris,to like
Chris,fuck
Chris,ingame
Chris,lol
Chris,why is that a topic of conversation
Chris,dont worry about it
Chris,it started off with some guy asking if he should get sea of thieves and we're here now
Chris,have you ever seen sao
Chris,ye
Chris,and they never definitivley answer
Chris,if you cna fuck or not
Chris,like
Chris,the main bitch strips then smacks the dude in the face
Chris,but thats as close as they get
Chris,Imma say yes
Chris,But I'm no weeb so my opinion doesn't hold much water
Chris,well considering she did strip chances are its possible
Chris,As long as they have genitals and can experience tactile sensations
Chris,okay so one of my main bitches linked me some SaO Smut and apparently its cannon that they can fuck
Chris,its not actually smut im like 80% sure its a cannon novel
Chris,but dont quote me
Chris,yeah but the whole point of the question is we don't know if they do or not @ trap
Chris,Did the girl who stripped have genitals?
Chris,for some reason I read that like the girl had her genitals stripped
Chris,she stripped to her underwear so its unclear
Chris,"so i got my boy james on the whole genital issue and all he said was ""idk they had dicks and pussies in the hentai i watched"""
Chris,james is high rn so hes not super helpful
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,okay so like
Chris,the other girls in the guild have fucked b4
Chris,so id assume they have genitals
Chris,tfw you play too much counter strike and get carpal tunnel
Chris,yo we should get some 8 man pubg going sometime
Chris,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Chris,Yo somebody kick this guy
Chris,Yo I just saw a police officer take somebody off a train with a m4 assult rifle and they say Canada dosent have guns lol but truthfully sorta spooked me a little
Chris,Where the fuck do you get an M4 in Canada?
Chris,Did the cop have it or the dude
Chris,fusion had it
Chris,Oh duh
Chris,the cop lol but yes i also have an m4
Chris,Arrest this man

Chris,Also I asked them about it in their discord and they were super condesending
Chris,@Jed wanna join a cs team? We lost a guy and need a lurk
Chris,I mean I'm kinda bad
Chris,Also what's the time commitment?
Chris,"I think we'd be playing around 4 nights a week. It would basically take up the free time you spent on rifles in pubg to some degree I imagine, but I still think it would be pretty fun to be on the team together. Especially since I'm not complete ass at the game now"
Chris,Prolly not

Chris,Nah
Chris,You cross the border before you get to customs
Chris,"Wait you're wrong. If I was driving into Buffalo, I would be stopped by the US border. When I come back I would be stopped by the Canadian border"

Yeah no you cross into Canada before you get through customs"
Chris,There is a park n shit
Chris,You have to go through customs when crossing the border?
Chris,No after
Chris,You know what I mean
Chris,I mean like the booth where they ask you questions and shit

Chris,Thought that qualifies as customs
Chris,Nah we drove
Chris,oh
Chris,Only like 7-8 hour drive
Chris,True
Chris,When you said customs I thought that you were referring to them checking your bags and stuff
Chris,Nah
Chris,They just asked like 5 questions and let us through

Chris,IS LEFF BOUTA SAVE MELEE
Chris,die the villain or live long enough to become the hero

Chris,doing school work
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,I have defeated you
Chris,??
Chris,
Chris,???
Chris,I'm confused
Chris,it has something to do with fairy tail but other that I have no idea
Chris,"I just watched an episode of fairy tail where all the main characters turned into Batman. And they broke the fourth wall by saying ""oh no she's turned realistic"" considering such an odd episode I thought it might be funny enough to get you to watch so.e"
Chris,Some*
Chris,didn't work
Chris,Fuck
Chris,Nigerian whore sack
Chris,you're not supposed to start with saying you've defeated me
Chris,Somebody kick this guy
Chris,it encourages me to disprove you out of spite
Chris,also this wasn't particularly inspiring
Chris,Sylki I am determined to get you to watch this show
Chris,@Sak von Sak melee???
Chris,Sylki 1v1 me rust
Chris,"I'm more curious to know how DBZ wrangled its context to include the line ""Hold your fire, this man isn't black!"" with a straight face"
Chris,I can explain
Chris,If you watch fairy tail. I am a sucker for million episode shows
Chris,That never end :(
Chris,That is what long shows tend to do
Chris,Except fairy tail is over now
Chris,So is dbz
Chris,which is why they tend to suck
Chris,Except the movies that come out
Chris,"dragon ball is still going, dbz might be done"
Chris,Fairy tail definitely has some shitty story arcs not gonna lie
Chris,The highs are high but the lows are meh
Chris,"and my stance on super long shows is basically: I could watch several great short shows in this time, maybe I""ll do that instead"
Chris,What kind of show even is it?
Chris,the highs are bad the lows are terrible
Chris,why do you want someone to watch it with you so badly?
Chris,wait
Chris,ill watch it with you
Chris,i dont have anything better to do
Chris,@Trapezoider
Chris,"so I'm gonna watch made in abyss, and re creators, and higurashi, and grimgar, and monster, eureka 7, and your lie in april, and monster, and a fuck ton of other stuff first"
Chris,"""the highs are bad the lows are terrible"" ""I'll watch it with you"" MAKES SENSE"
Chris,am down to watch a bad show
Chris,I mean it can be fun to watch something with the intention of laughing at it
Chris,you still haven't finished made in abyss???
Chris,a gonna have fun making fun of it
Chris,see: me watching girls und panzer
Chris,ava I have watched like nothing in the last month and a half other than watching kill la kill with you and andrew

Chris,"Random thought: denotations of time make no sense. I mean days are reasonable - it's the time it takes to start dark, get light, then get dark again and you sleep in the middle - and so are years - turning of the seasons, earth going around the sun, etc. - but the rest are irrational. What is an hour? a minute? a second? a week? why do they fit so badly into each other? who designed this stupid system?"
Chris,Still better than the imperial system
Chris,I'm pretty sure the hour is used to tell the position of the sun
Chris,yeah but why are there 24 per dday
Chris,that's an arbitrary number
Chris,especially cause you can't see the sun for half the day
Chris,same thing with weeks
Chris,like I get it's pulled from god making the earth in seven days
Chris,but it's still weird
Chris,"at least months almost make sense cause thye're matched up to the cycles of the moon, sort of"
Chris,The system makes more or less sense depending on where you live
Chris,Also it takes 24 hours for the earth to complete one revolution on its center axis
Chris,yes but why TWENTY FOUR
Chris,like what is one hour that made us decide to use it as a measure of time? we have one day for one rotation of the earth
Chris,That doesn't not make 24 an arbiratry number trap
Chris,Yes it does
Chris,Because 24
Chris,>0
Chris,Get rekt
Chris,nerds
Chris,What
Chris,
Chris,Tfw ur mum gay
Chris,get  out of my christian minecraft server
Chris,Which one? @Jed
Chris,you heccin tard
Chris,@Jed
Chris,When are you back?
Chris,At like 6
Chris,The ur mum gay bit was aimed at trap
Chris,Because with his logic the gay clearly transferred
Chris,Yeah
Chris,gay traps > octagons and doctors
Chris,This just in the entire medical community is deemed worth less than one gay trap
Chris,@Sak von Sak time is done the way it is because it is in a base 6 number system
Chris,"60 seconds

24 hours"

Chris,When?
Chris,4-4:30 PST is start time
Chris,@Jed
Chris,Buy that esea my guy. Ill pay you at the gym tomorrow
Chris,@deleted-role I have created a meetup planning document. Please join it.
Chris,"on my exam today I wrote one of the most disgusting single lines of code of my life, which I will try to replicate here:"
Chris,| mod (length list) 2 != 0 = take (((length list)/2) - 0.5) (zipWith (+) list (reverse list)) : (head (reverse (take (((length list)/2)+0.5) list)))
Chris,it's highly efficient but it's such a mess
Chris,What does this even do?
Chris,"A direct translation of what it's doing: it checks to see if the length of a list is divisible by two, and if it isn't, it takes the first half (rounded down) values from a new list that it creates where each element is the sum of an element in the list plus that same position in the list if the list was backwards, and then concatenates that to the first value of the reverse of the first half (rounded up) values in the original list

A more straightforward explanation: if a list cannot be divided into two halves of equal length, it creates a new list where each element is the sum of the list folded over onto itself (so the first value plus the last, the second value plus the second last, etc., and the final value is just the middle value)"
Chris,"normally I would not do that in a single line, but in haskell you kinda sorta gotta unless you want to write ten times as much code"
Chris,I originally wrote out the whole function (which is more than just that) as way more code but I had spare time so I decided to write out the more efficient version I figured out halfway through an unrelated question later on the exam
Chris,I condensed like a page of code into three extremely disgusting lines
Chris,of which that was the worst
Chris,Damn son
Chris,also I get to cheerfully come home and start studying for my monday exam -_-
Chris,"someone put together a single slide deck of all the slides the prof said to study, and this is on the first slide"
Chris,fuck me
Chris,@Homies someone do something with me I need to unwind a bit

Chris,4b99e5e8
Chris,7c6998b8

Chris,@Zain sorry buddy :(
Chris,Are you getting hit by this storm as well @Zain
Chris,Does anyone know if hereditary memes can change the gene pool of a population to express different phenotypes more or less?
Chris,Memes are not hereditary
Chris,Hereditary memes?
Chris,are you okay?
Chris,Memes as in the cultural ideas that pass from mind to mind as first proposed by Richard Dawkins are hereditary in a sense. If you parents possess the meme of religion you are more likely to receive this meme from then
Chris,Religion is not a meme
Chris,That's not what he means by meme
Chris,A meme is a unit of cultural evolution
Chris,Religion is something that has evolved over time with culture
Chris,Religion = scientific meme
Chris,Not funny meme
Chris,memes predate religion
Chris,The reason I ask is because I have noticed a quarelation between religious females and their attractiveness. Not to say there aren't attractive atheist.
Chris,I have actually noticed this too
Chris,what
Chris,"I might just have the ""I grew up in a Christian home"" bias"
Chris,saying you find religious ones more attractive?
Chris,^
Chris,Possibly
Chris,yeah
Chris,There appears to be a quarelation greater than .6 linking thicc and religiosity
Chris,are you sure its not just confirmation bias?
Chris,I'm not
Chris,"There has actually been research that conservatives are on average more attractive. So since most Christians are conservative, maybe that is the correlation."
Chris,I want to test it
Chris,Research must be done
Chris,For science
Chris,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Chris,Yes. Go upto attractive women and ask them if they are religious
Chris,Then ask for their number
Chris,I told you about that movie thing right
Chris,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Chris,No
Chris,
Chris,Tell us
Chris,oh well one of my buds from West was like hey do you want to go to a movie with me and some other people
Chris,like its only him and girls at first so he invited me
Chris,and I was like aight I hadn't hung out with him for a while so I went
Chris,he was like oh yeah so I'm pretty sure one of the girls likes me so i was basically the wingman
Chris,Yoda noises intensify
Chris,I was walking in to the movies with him and the girl that liked him and she asked if I thought one of her friends was cute and I didn't wanna be rude and be like nah
Chris,and I mean she kinda was
Chris,so I was like yeah I guess
Chris,and she was like oh well she thinks you're cute too
Chris,and its funny cause I knew this girl when I went to school with her and we hadn't really talked a whole lot but now that i don't go there anymore she thinks I'm cute? okay then
Chris,jed is only cute when you don't see him everyday
Chris,but basically the rest of the time was them trying to get us together but I wasn't really tryna mess around
Chris,also side note truth or dare is the worst movie of 2018
Chris,but I was a successful wingman 
Chris,"That feeling is called ""saudade"". It's a word only existant in portuguese, it is ""the wistful longing for something you no longer have""."
Chris,i think
Chris,dont quote me
Chris,lmao
Chris,I almost sent it though but I think the only reason I didn't is cause I asked a girl out earlier that day and the response was a maybe but leaning towards yes
Chris,so friday was a weird day for me
Chris,What the heck man
Chris,Jed gettin all kinds of ladies
Chris,Fellas is it gay to date a lady?
Chris,^
Chris,I mean you are literally going out with someone who sucks dick

Chris,@Rivals of Aether lets do a tournament sometime 
Chris,@Trapezoider check your snap
Chris,Can someone help me with a thing on transformations of graphs
Chris,
Chris,Like I don't get what they want
Chris,g(x)=-7f(x) or f(x)=-7g(x) I would think
Chris,My problems are usually not in terms of f(x) and g(x) so I'm not sure which one goes where
Chris,but reflecting a graph makes the function negative
Chris,and stretching by a factor of 7 means multiply by 7
Chris,Can you show the functions represented by f(x) and g(x)?
Chris,Just tryna figure out where to input that information
Chris,No they don't show me the graphs :(
Chris,Did my suggestion not work?
Chris,I'm going to bed now but good luck.
Chris,@Trapezoider whenever you get a chance to look at it I shared it with you so just put comments where you have them
Chris,You don't need to know what f(x) or g(x) are
Chris,I don't remember exactly how it works but I'm pretty sure you want something like g(x) = -f(1/7 x)
Chris,cause the negative gives you the vertical flip and the 1/7 x gives you the horizontal stretch
Chris,@Max
Chris,Yes they worked
Chris,boo in my high school we wouldn't have gotten marks for cheesing a horizontal stretch as a vertical one
Chris,My dad shutoff my fucking internet
Chris,riiiiip
Chris,Fuck that guy
Chris,I'm 17 and you tryna give me a bed time

Chris,doc are you gonna be back in frostbite now that exams are over?
Chris,I've been here all week 
Chris,I havent seen you 
Chris,I just wasn't in the mood for any csgo
Chris,
Chris,Are you still planning on attending to meetup?
Chris,i miss you dad
Chris,"i got those airline tickets and ZACK
 is getting busfare soon"
Chris,*zack
Chris,fuck
Chris,Yeah
Chris,Nice
Chris,My parents would like to know if you buy tickets
Chris,I buy not tickets yet
Chris,Nice
Chris,lol
Chris,Did you even read what Max said @Trapezoider
Chris,I was mocking him
Chris,wait what did he say
Chris,Did he fix it
Chris,it doesnt say edited
Chris,Hello
Chris,If I say my message aloud it sounds perfectly fine
Chris,yeah
Chris,tense is a bit weird
Chris,My parents
Chris,"should be bought tickets, not buy tickets"
Chris,you can't read that and say that it was fine
Chris,Woud like to know
Chris,If you buy tickets
Chris,"but I know he has not yet, hence bought doesn't work"
Chris,no
Chris,because he hasnt yet
Chris,So they would like to know when he has
Chris,ok it could also be will buy
Chris,no it is do buy
Chris,using present tense doesn't work unless you're asking if that's what he is doing right now
Chris,or what he does in general
Chris,Holy fuck
Chris,Stop
Chris,"What do you for a living?
I buy tickets"
Chris,Yes
Chris,Have you bought tickets?
Chris,he was talking future tense
Chris,"""My parents would like to know if you buy tickets (some time in the future)"""
Chris,it makes sense
Chris,except that 'you buy' is present tense
Chris,its not
Chris,ok
Chris,what is the present tense of 'to buy' then
Chris,How about; if you are going to buy tickets
Chris,but that isn't what they want to know
Chris,yeah they want to know when(if) it happens
Chris,then you guys are just asking the wrong question
Chris,Then why would you use present tense?
Chris,"you should just ask ""are you going to buy tickets"""
Chris,that isn't the question either
Chris,no thats not it
Chris,literally don't even care
Chris,when are you going to buy tickets
Chris,he wanted to know when he buys tickets if he does
Chris,tell him after it happens
Chris,waezsxrdtcfvygubhnj
Chris,"then ask: are you going to buy tickets? if so, when? also, let us know when you do"
Chris,because the original question did not communicate that
Chris,thats over complicated
Chris,it's clear though
Chris,I UNDERSTOOD YOU GUYS ARE DUM B
Chris,THATS SOUNDS SO FORMAL
Chris,"Try it like this ""My parents would like to know if you die"""
Chris,same thing different words
Chris,The first question you asked did not communicate any of that information
Chris,it totally did
Chris,yeah but that's not how languages work because language is dumb
Chris,most verbs having to do with the state of a person have slightly different rules
Chris,I'm going to delete the message and leave this server if you guys don't shut up
Chris,it matters so little
Chris,omg
Chris,calm down
Chris,you understood what I meant
Chris,we didn't though
Chris,the end result would be that doctor would alert me if he purchased tickets
Chris,mission accomplished
Chris,*shrugs* 'spose
Chris,side question: am I alone in enjoying breaking down language and weird specifics of stuff? or is it just that I spent enough time having stuff beaten into my head while learning french that I've developed stockholm syndrome?
Chris,I find it to be very boring
Chris,It can be sometimes interesting
Chris,like in what just happened
Chris,I like comparing languages but being a grammar nazi isn't fun
Chris,I think it's neat

Chris,Is there an equation to calculate someone's response to a question
Chris,Pls
Chris,What does that even mean? @Trapezoider
Chris,Huh
Chris,Oh wow I actually wrote that
Chris,I thought that was part of the dream
Chris,Huh
Chris,Don't worry about it brother
Chris,haha what 
Chris,I had a dream I was messaging you guys in discord last night while trying to make an important life decision
Chris,Turns out I actually messaged you because I wasn't asleep yet :(
Chris,
Chris,I'm glad I fell asleep before the dream happened :) shit got real
Chris,This is so confusing
Chris,what was the decision?
Chris,Weather or not to do it to em boys
Chris,
Chris,How else would the dream had happened? Dreams only happen when you sleep.
Chris,That's untrue
Chris,Not if you're on drugs
Chris,I guess when you space out
Chris,Ever heard of daydreaming
Chris,but you're technically not asleep
Chris,...that's the point
Chris,"even if you daydream, you're not alseep, so you're not technically dreaming. You're actually deep in thought"
Chris,"yes, but your brain patterns 'n stuff are often closer to when you're falling asleep than when you're awake"
Chris,it's kind of an in-between state
Chris,take it from me who day dreams alot and has had some pretty messed up dreams in my life.
Chris,"BTW, while we're on the subject, have any of you guys tried to Lucid Dream?"
Chris,never actively tried but it happens every now and then
Chris,I am trying to master it so I can work during the night
Chris,I have. It's BEYOND trippy!
Chris,If I can lucid dream I can practice piano while I sleep etc
Chris,Even though I actually didn't try. My mind wouldn't settle down for some reason.
Chris,"Towards the end I actually got a little scared cause I was like, ""How do I wake up?!"""
Chris,Are you sure practicing piano in a dream would translate to real life??
Chris,Just form a cliff
Chris,Then jump off
Chris,weirdly it actually would
Chris,wild
Chris,cause you're training all the same bits of your brain that are holding the muscle memory
Chris,I think it would work
Chris,same patterns of brain activation
Chris,"I've heard if you die in a dream, there's a chance you could die in real life. Not know how true that is tho"
Chris,"probably not as well, but it could help"
Chris,also no that's 100% bullshit
Chris,thats not true
Chris,That's what I thought
Chris,well technically you could but it's the same chance as dying at any other point of your life
Chris,you're stupid
Chris,"Well maybe something could happen to your brain if you die in a dream, but that might not be true either."
Chris,You're brain doesn't function that way
Chris,It would have to produce a neurotransmitter which is toxic and produce it in high enough doses
Chris,"Well sorry, I'm not an expert on the brain functions!"
Chris,But the brain doesn't and wouldn't do that
Chris,wow neurotransmitter! That's a big word for you 
Chris,the placebo effect is strong but we're damn good at not tricking ourselves into dying
Chris,^^^
Chris,maybe it is for you but not for him
Chris,not everyone's retarded
Chris,"true... but I'm not, neither is he or you"
Chris,I don't know. None of us know you well enough to confirm or deny that. Except max and Ava 
Chris,that emoji makes me want to die

Chris,he picked me up cause apperently I beat a Kragg who is supposedly good
Chris,so I'm reading a javascript textbook
Chris,"""Every now and then, usually between eight and ten in the evening, Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail."""
Chris,what
Chris,"later on in the same chapter,

""For a few years, things go great for Jacques. But at some point he loses his job. Because he lives in a nasty country where having no job means having no medical services, he is forced to take employment with a circus where he performs as The Incredible Squirrelman, stuffing his mouth with peanut butter before every show.

One day, fed up with this pitiful existence, Jacques fails to change back into his human form, hops through a crack in the circus tent, and vanishes into the forest. He is never seen again."""
Chris,Why would this be in a java textbook?
Chris,Yeah what the hell
Chris,it was to set up the premise for data for a series of examples
Chris,"also, javascript, not java"
Chris,different languages
Chris,Would that make this any less weird?

Chris,wait so you got an internship with your brother as your boss lol
Chris,yup
Chris,"nepotism, bitch"
Chris,wait so how are you planning to learn it react is pretty small but an not sure about redux
Chris,tons of massive ass tutorials
Chris,practice
Chris,what was that game
Chris,n0ne is a lunatic
Chris,that was way closer than it had any right to be
Chris,if he hadn't thrown away that ganon stock he could have won that
Chris,that recovery vs scorp tho
Chris,yeah that was unbelievable
Chris,was actually insane
Chris,I've never seen falcon recovery like that
Chris,imo n0ne is best at falcon recovery
Chris,god n0ne is the fucking best
Chris,wizzy is best at everything else

Chris,@Jed
Chris,zack I asked her to go ice skating
Chris,This is the moment of truth Br0THER
Chris,did you ask her over text
Chris,I asked her on our run this morning when  she came over
Chris,and she said
Chris,She would consult other tentative plans. And would provide and answer around this time. Lookin like a fat no
Chris,"also, you guys have indoor rinks? didn't occur to me that the states would have that"
Chris,Hell yeah. There are like 2 nearby ish
Chris,r
Chris,i
Chris,p
Chris,F
Chris,F
Chris,"@Trapezoider  most likely if she said she'd concult plans it means she's not interested. (Or maybe she is, but most likely not...)"
Chris,or maybe she just doesn't like skating
Chris,we gotta stay optimistic
Chris,I'm with Zack
Chris,I guess...
Chris,I feel like skating isn't all that popular in the states
Chris,I tried ice skating this one time and I sucked at it.
Chris,fell on my butt like 20 times
Chris,yeah that's skating at first
Chris,still easier than snowboarding
Chris,first time I tried I spent more time on the ground than on my feet
Chris,but in general skating ignores a lot of the things you instinctively do to stay balanced
Chris,cause you can't brace yourself except sideways
Chris,that was the same with me. The only time I was actually standing was when I was hugging the wall.
Chris,skating takes time
Chris,only reason I'm any good is cause canada
Chris,lots of practice
Chris,Though I'd much rather roll skate than ice skate.
Chris,shudders
Chris,I don't like how hard it is to stop on roller skates
Chris,"stopping on roller skates is tough, but you can at least STAND on them."
Chris,it's a skill on skates -_-
Chris,its something you have to learn
Chris,but at least I know that if I'm out of control I can stop quickly

Chris,"partially built on the fact that, as a socially inept introvert, it's rare that I meet people where I can spend an evening just chilling without doing any specific activity and not feel drained or like we ran out of stuff to talk about and stuff got awkward"
Chris,and it was just a good chill happy time

Chris,I just watched the end of the last mafia and chillin threw so hard
Chris,he had it in the bag
Chris,and he fucked up right at the end
Chris,"also this is getting me to want to try some mafia, who'd be down to play?"
Chris,me
Chris,As am I
Chris,how many people do we need to get a proper game going?
Chris,I think somewhere in the realm of 12-14
Chris,"google says you need at least 7, 2 mafia vs 5 town"
Chris,today won't work for me though because I have 3 finals tomorrow
Chris,I think 2 vs 5 is for speed mafia without the medic cop and vigilante
Chris,I can't for the next 12 days
Chris,I mean I think you need some town roles
Chris,I feel like doing 2 mafia 4 town 1 cop would be best
Chris,Yo what about the doctor tho
Chris,eh less important imo
Chris,Let's do it when Chris gets back
Chris,Astralis got 3-0'd last night :(

Chris,m2k won 3-2
Chris,and he won every game in the marth ditto and 3-0ed him in a marth ditto a few tourneys ago

Chris,Submitted
Chris,Should have been anonymous though

Chris,just delete the spam results
Chris,I'm not sure if they are spam though
Chris,someone may have just used a dumb name and responded almost exactly like another person
Chris,can we access poll results soon?

Chris,possibly not tonight
Chris,probably not tonight

Chris,WOOOOO
Chris,@Max
Chris,lets play skullgirls
Chris,alright
Chris,let me go get my controller cable and refil my coffee
Chris,5 mins
Chris,andrew did you lean any combos?
Chris,"if not, max should probably play not his main"
Chris,@The Rona
Chris,buy your texas tickets big gay
Chris,!zack
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,how do you break out of combos
Chris,This game is hard
Chris,@everyone
Chris,Let's have a skill girls tournament on Saturday
Chris,I mean you don't break out of combos
Chris,but if you see this weird smoke stuff you can hit any button to burst
Chris,but htat only happens if the other person repeats the same thing too many times in the same combo
Chris,"and if me or max is comboing you, we've learned combos that don't let you break out"
Chris,
Chris,"but generally, it's not optimal to do the full combo unless it's gonna kill"
Chris,cause the longer the combo the less any individual hit does
Chris,"you ideally want to combo someone a bit, then trick them and start a new combo with fresh damage scaling"
Chris,but neither me nor max is good enough to do that yet
Chris,"also, max, did you go fukua against him? that wasn't very nice of you lol"
Chris,I only remember half the combo
Chris,I know next to nothing about any other character and didn't feel like figuring it out
Chris,@Trapezoider I'll be down for games in like an hour and a half
Chris,Hell yeah

Chris,"also, the nearest in & out is an hour and a half walk away and I'm salty"
Chris,I might do it anyway
Chris,Welcome to America!
Chris,guys your roads are so nice
Chris,True
Chris,"If you come to the meetup you can see the widest highway in the entire world. The Katy Freeway, which is something like 16 lanes."
Chris,Depends where tho
Chris,"I mean it's more just like, they're hella smooth"
Chris,cause there aren't proper winters here
Chris,so you don't get tons of potholes
Chris,I'm not used to this
Chris,Warm climate>cold climate
Chris,"on the flip side, it's about a million degrees in my room"
Chris,and there's no AC
Chris,lemme add 'fan' to my shopping list
Chris,good idea
Chris,"once I unpacked my computer, the first thing I looked up was the nearest in and out, and the second thing was making sure the tap water is drinkable"
Chris,"priorities, motherfuckers"
Chris,"tap water: safe to drink
tap water: tastes kinda bad"
Chris,"also, your paper money sucks"

Chris,my next best option is kfc
Chris,Its decent
Chris,is kfc a better bet?
Chris,they're both meh imo
Chris,but which one is more meh
Chris,I think it depends on if you want burger or chicken
Chris,choose based on that
Chris,I mean I don't really care one way or the other?
Chris,dammit I'm trying to get you guys to make up my mind
Chris,choose jack in the box
Chris,

Chris,Yes all 206 or whatever
Chris,wow

Chris,At least you didn't have to put a certain number of dots on each country based off it's population
Chris,That was fun
Chris,Damn
Chris,Oh Christ
Chris,Why is the education system so retarded
Chris,Nah it's just this teacher really
Chris,But I mean yeah
Chris,He doesn't even give tests it's always projects

Chris,@Homies do you guys wanna have a melee tournament where Zack and max can't play their mains or secondaries?
Chris,I'm down
Chris,I guess so
Chris,"Honestly, depending on skill level, you may need to ban 15+ characters"
Chris,for us
Chris,we could do it like we used to do rivals tournaments
Chris,we should do it like rivals where each person gets a certain number of bans
Chris,based on skill
Chris,great minds think alike
Chris,^
Chris,maybe I could even rope in Ava for one more
Chris,lets try and do it tonight
Chris,so do we have 4 so far?
Chris,we could maybe get up to 6
Chris,I'm curious what my ping's gonna be like to everyone
Chris,I think we'll have to except that some people will have awful ping
Chris,I'll have great ping to andrew for once
Chris,I have fine ping to the shapes so we should be okay
Chris,and jed
Chris,"also, do you want to play a bit in like an hour? I want to get a little more done but then I want a break"
Chris,I'm down

Chris,@cs 1 game ?
Chris,@Zain  ?>
Chris,@Max is thing happen tonight?
Chris,no
Chris,Jed isn't here
Chris,"@Sak von Sak  Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you been watching the Persona 5 Animation? If you are, how are you enjoying it?"
Chris,it's.... mediocre
Chris,it gets the broad strokes
Chris,but the pacing's wack
Chris,really?
Chris,and it's skipped a lot of little important character moments
Chris,it's missing a lot of the charm the game had
Chris,"Well I mean, trying to crame moments into a 30 minute episode and 24 of them, I can see how the pacing can be off."
Chris,"I only saw one episode, the battle against Kamoshida (the first boss)."
Chris,I mean it's not horrible
Chris,but you'd be better off playing the game
Chris,my biggest problem is they keep cutting good character building moments
Chris,and it's persona
Chris,you can't just skip the character building
Chris,and the back-and-forth and stuff that builds the characters into a group with dynamics and stuff rather than just a bunch of characters shoved together
Chris,"also the protag is both a) bland as fuck, and b) practically non-existant as a character"
Chris,"I know they're running him from a silent protagonist in the game, but even in-game they gave him a lot more character than this"
Chris,"like, watch the p4 anime if you want to see a persona protag handled well"
Chris,"or even the p3 movies, although he's kind of an emo little shit, but at least that's actually a personality"
Chris,sorry

Chris,Meetup
Chris,
Chris,Hey it's like frostbites 3 years anniversary
Chris,Ah
Chris,how do you know
Chris,Because I met you guys for the tf2 team 3 years ago
Chris,frostbite is a bit older than you knowing them is
Chris,frostbite was actually a bit later
Chris,but the core group was earlier
Chris,I wasn't even part of the original core group
Chris,the original team where we all met was called frostbite
Chris,thats where the name came from
Chris,I joined like... two and a half years ago?
Chris,oh huh
Chris,"so it was frostbite, then not frostbite, then frostbite again?"
Chris,yes
Chris,Frostbite>Pancake Pals>POOP>Rolo Regiment>Frostbite
Chris,I've known you guys for 3 years is what I was saying
Chris,It's my anniversary of knowing you guys
Chris,POOP?
Chris,POOP
Chris,is that an acronym?
Chris,People Order Our Patties
Chris,o h
Chris,I voted against it
Chris,its funny
Chris,that team was made of spongebob references
Chris,Man we've had a lot of good times
Chris,RIP frostbite gamers
Chris,"unrelated, but I had a dream last night that my friend (in the dream, now that I'm awake I have no idea who he was) got turned into a giant monster cause he fell into a pool of red bull and the army was after him so me and some other people took him and ran away to australia where we just kinda chilled in a hotel room and threw cookies at each other"
Chris,"also unrelated, to both the previous conversation and my previous thing, I found the best twitter: it's a bot that scrapes github for people committing stuff with swearing in it and posts them. It scratches two great itches of 1) relating to salty programmers, and 2) hilarious mixing of professional, technical writing with swearing"
Chris,for example: https://twitter.com/gitlost/status/996784597194170369
Chris,I MADE THIS SHIT TO WORK ASYNCHRONOUSLY WITH SMALL DELAYS
Chris,Make a film off of that dream please
Chris,"Screenshot (May 16, 2018 10:29:28 AM)"
Chris,The first frostbite discord post
Chris,Actually I feel like that's wrong my discord might be lying to me
Chris,Holy crap
Chris,My guy how long did you scroll
Chris,Lol
Chris,Remember when we used mumble
Chris,Doctors mumble server
Chris,No it was kamerons
Chris,:0
Chris,Cause it was mumble tf2
Chris,my first tf2 team still has a facebook page and it's mad nostalgic
Chris,
Chris,am just an overwatch scrub lol
Chris,I'm scrolling back through now and I found the best picture I've ever taken
Chris,Yo everyone keep sending old screenshots on getting so much nostalgia
Chris,
Chris,This is the beginning of my server
Chris,what about the OG frostbite?
Chris,I left that server :0
Chris,Why
Chris,@Bitmin
Chris,esea
Chris,im only back now and a bit later
Chris,That was a good nostalgia trip
Chris,^
Chris,Man I remember mumble
Chris,I honestly dont really remember mumble
Chris,discord is so much better
Chris,I remember I hated discord whnr it came out
Chris,Mumbles interface was terrible
Chris,Discord is a huge step up
Chris,I don't know how we used it for so long
Chris,"If we've known Trap for 3 years, does that mean we've known each other for 4? @Max @Mr. Airplane"
Chris,"no, its been 3 years for us"
Chris,around 2 and a half for him
Chris,@The Rona
Chris,September 25 is the earliest thing I can find in Monday night super slammed whatever
Chris,Of 2015
Chris,Kameron Chris and I were on a team before that
Chris,it formed in May 2015
Chris,^
Chris,
Chris,I joined early 2016 if I remember correctly
Chris,Chikon nd the cock fighters right
Chris,Or rolo regiment
Chris,Right?
Chris,rolo regiment
Chris,not even the weirdest team name I've played for
Chris,that probably goes to 'It's Raining Minh'
Chris,HA
Chris,Was the leader Chinese?
Chris,not even
Chris,the story goes a little like this:
Chris,"there was a team, with some normal name"
Chris,their medic was this guy who went by minh
Chris,and they had some weird in-joke about 'minh advantage'
Chris,"eventually, said team disbanded, and a few people got together to make a new team, which was called minh advantage"
Chris,"that team also broke up, and a new subset of that team, containing a few people from the original team whose name I don't remember, made another new team, minh advantage II"
Chris,which is when I joined
Chris,"then there was some upheaval with a patch that messed with demo and heavy a bit and like, half the team quit"
Chris,"it was then patched up with some teammates from my first tf2 team and some tryouts, and rechristened It's Raining Minh"
Chris,and we went on to make playoffs
Chris,and then disband
Chris,You should make a movie out of that
Chris,I'm now wondering if some people from it's raining minh went on to make another team with a name containing minh
Chris,"also, as It's Raining Minh our team tag was a little umbrella that is for some reason an accepted unicode character"
Chris,@Melee anyone want to play for a bit?
Chris,yes
Chris,I can't talk tho
Chris,k
Chris,@Melee I am unsatiated

Chris,"@Sak von Sak  I got a Persona 5 question, since you're the wizard at this stuff. Someone I watch on Youtube was describing anime characters in 4 seconds and someone gave him Morgana and he said ""IT'S TIME TO GO TO FREAKIN' SLEEP!"" how does that describe Morgana?"
Chris,@Bitmin wanna csgo?
Chris,Oh jeez I have not slept in a couple day but I'll play 1 game give me a couple mins
Chris,oh ok
Chris,pfffft yeah
Chris,it's a meme
Chris,that you probably won't experience in the show
Chris,"but basically at the end of days in-game, sometimes based on events during the day you can't go out or anything, but the game still gives you some control over your character"
Chris,but if you try to leave
Chris,Morgana: You look tired. You should get some sleep.
Chris,it's an integral part of the p5 experience
Chris,
Chris,"had to vanish to catch an uber, but to finish, it's become such a prominant thing that the company that made the game is selling shirts of it

Chris,Whoever made that should be arrested by the CDC for causing a health disaster
Chris,@Weeb
Chris,so my hero academia is a good show
Chris,nice
Chris,"I won't deny that, it's just personally doesn't appeal to me."
Chris,yee that show's awesome
Chris,how far in are you?
Chris,4 episodes
Chris,I watched it this morning
Chris,I may be sleep deprived but I teared up a little bit 
Chris,I think I'm gay 
Chris,Crying as a man doesn't mean you're gay
Chris,but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
Chris,
Chris,who said I'm gay?
Chris,literally nobody
Chris,^ we were talking about me
Chris,"well when he said
but it doesnt not mean you're gay either 
after my comment, I thought he was talking about me"
Chris,Nah he's saying I'm gay
Chris,
Chris,"well like I said, crying as a man doesn't mean your gay."
Chris,you are of hte gay andrew
Chris,Snap
Chris,I thought I liked girls
Chris,"In fact, it shows that you're a true man as true men know how to express their feelings"
Chris,^^^ true brother
Chris,"and besides, you're not gay in my book unless you're making out with dudes."
Chris,bruh i feel like you can still make out with dudes and not be gay
Chris,aslong as your socks are on
Chris,"if you were forced, maybe."
Chris,"like if my LIFE or something VERY precious to me was on the line, I'd probably do it. But otherwise, nuh uh!"
Chris,Compelled homosexuality
Chris,like if some dude came up to me  and offered me $20 to make out with him id probably do it so i see where you're coming from mrd256
Chris,"I wouldn't do it for $20, unless I was desperate."
Chris,i am
Chris,you're broke then
Chris,College
Chris,"eh, makes sense"
Chris,"I could get two extra large pepperoni pizzas for $20

I would give a guy a quick peck on the lips for two extra large pepperoni pizzas, especially in this situation where there's clearly no expectations of anything beyond that. I'm not desperate or broke, I just really like pizza."
Chris,with $20 i can buy literally 60 packs of ramen
Chris,thats lunch for 2 months
Chris,ramen in America is unhealthy you now that.
Chris,"like, extremely"
Chris,clearly you don't understand university living
Chris,it's far more healthy to eat ramen every day for lunch
Chris,than to not eat lunch
Chris,^
Chris,fucking
Chris,preach
Chris,"Well I'm not in collage or live by my self yet, so maybe it don't."
Chris,but the pizzas though
Chris,"And while ramen is not good for you, it is better than not eating anything. Doesn't make it healthier tho"
Chris,at the end of the day I think it comes down to priorities: there's not much on that level of harmlessness that I wouldn't do for $20
Chris,"Listen, $20 is $20"
Chris,^
Chris,@Cs:go gamezzzzzzzz
Chris,Ya boi sold his car
Chris,Firebird incoming
Chris,Prolly
Chris,proud of you dad

Chris,Well the Firebirds are also 20+ years old
Chris,"but are high performance sports cars designed for optimal control and speed balance. Im so excited for you though, youre going to be boolin   and impressin all kinds of ladies"

Chris,congrats!!
Chris,"@Zack  So I was playing Persona 5 and I think I noticed an animation error in one of the cutscenes. This is the beach scene. Yusuke holds up his hands like he's trying to picture something in the next shot his hands are like backwards? Thought you might find this interesting.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449728861484220416/unknown.png
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415719917824770071/449729119408619551/unknown.png"
Chris,lol I never noticed that
Chris,probably just a laziness thing
Chris,I was probably a little too busy cracking up at the towel thing
Chris,"It's just something funny that caught my eye.
Yeah, the towel thing was funny too."
Chris,"Tho one of the highlights for me in this scene, was the protagonist actually speaking an actual line. Just based on his battle quotes, I think they choose a great english VA for him, but he doesn't speak enough, even during battle."
Chris,"If there is a Persona 5 animation dub, I'd watch it just to hear his VA in full."
Chris,Xander Mobus
Chris,he's the announcer guy for sm4sh
Chris,and they picked him for basically just yelling names again
Chris,good pick
Chris,honestly the english cast for p5 is all damn good except maybe haru
Chris,"yeah, I think his voice fits him."
Chris,Haru... eh she's okay.
Chris,her voice was annoying at first but it grew on me
Chris,that's kinda the way it is will all really high-pitched girls
Chris,eh not always
Chris,but yeah pretty often
Chris,"Honestly, I wasn't too big a fan of Makoto's VA. Not that she was a bad actress, but the fact that her voice didn't really suit her. But that's me"
Chris,I am incredibly biased towards her voice actress because she's done a ton of roles I've loved
Chris,so I felt like it worked
Chris,but that might just be me
Chris,But the one VA I like out of them all is Morgana's. Cassandra Morris is one of my most favorite dub voice actresses
Chris,She had me terrified
Chris,you can't put kyubey's voice in a cutesy animal sidekick
Chris,you just can't do that
Chris,that's not ok
Chris,"Well, I don't really know who Kyubey is... but I like her because of some other roles she's done."
Chris,"And Morgana is not a ""Cutesy"" animal sidekick!"
Chris,"@ anyone who's watched madoka magica, confirm that you would be scared to hear his voice coming out of any cutesy animal sidekick"
Chris,"also, aesthetically, definitely cutesy"
Chris,"personality-wise, not as much"
Chris,I'll give you that
Chris,"also, you've finished p4, right?"
Chris,"I didn't play it, but I've watched the anime. But I did finish the anime"
Chris,"for p4, I correctly predicted the villain by their voice actor, cause I was like 'there is no way they would hire a voice actor this good at sounding badass and evil and give him to that derpy a character.'"
Chris,so I was never not suspicious of morgana
Chris,I'm not telling you if I was right or not
Chris,but I was scared from start to finish
Chris,"Most of the roles I know Morgana's VA from are all protagonist characters or sub characters. Nothing evil about them. Also, she was in p4's anime"
Chris,p4 had the weirdest voice cast
Chris,@Mr. Airplane show us your graduation pics or it's fake
Chris,"50% amazing, 50% terrible"
Chris,"Yeah, the only VAs I liked in p4 were Yu, Yosuke, Kanji, and Rise"
Chris,that would pretty much be their big-name voice actors in the main cast
Chris,yep
Chris,"Johnny Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker/Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey"
Chris,and then a bunch of mediocre people
Chris,and then some big names for tiny roles
Chris,that pretty much sums it up
Chris,"p5 has the best overall cast, p3 had a solid one with a few big problems"
Chris,it starts off so strong
Chris,"Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Vic Mignogna, Tara Platt, Liam O'Brian"
Chris,and then Fuuka shows up
Chris,heh
Chris,I didn't know Michelle Ruff and Liam O'Brian were in p3. Did Michelle voice Yukari?
Chris,"yeah, and Liam O'Brian did Akihiko"
Chris,Ah! I was thinking Akihiko was Josh Grelle.
Chris,"and Yukari is possibly my favorite Persona girl so far.
and my favorite Persona character period is possibly Akechi from p5"
Chris,"I Really like that sadistic and psychotic type of villian, especially where they look so innocent to begin with."
Chris,I always kinda figured he was gonna turn out evil
Chris,I just didn't realize... how evil
Chris,when he snaps he snaps
Chris,and his voice actor does an amazing job of it too
Chris,"He was like one of the main antagonists, next to Shido and the final boss"
Chris,yeah he does
Chris,and he was definitely the most interesting antagonist
Chris,true that
Chris,@here gamerinos my gamerinos?

Chris,especially when their rooms contain the only bathrooms

Chris,30 minute training session?
Chris,Sorry about to play a game of civ 5
Chris,training session?
Chris,DO YOU MEAN
Chris,MELEE
Chris,ill play
Chris,melee isnt fun with such high ping because high ping buffs you as a player and nerfs me. I will fight you when I am in texas and our ping is better
Chris,honestly high ping usually hurts the stronger player
Chris,"you can't combo as hard, or be as precise in neutral"
Chris,"no johns, andrew"
Chris,@Trapezoider Civ game isn't happening I can play now
Chris,youre wrong in this case zack
Chris,Kameron has no movement ability and little tech skill
Chris,he still has combos and neutral
Chris,My playstyle revolves around getting grabs and spacing around my opponent
Chris,which are far more affected
Chris,When I have 120 ping
Chris,"@Sak von Sak When your entire punish game is being good at tech chasing, high ping hurts a lot"
Chris,wavedashing because impossible
Chris,I guess
Chris,which is the case for trap
Chris,"also wavedashing and most tech is muscle memory, ping shouldn't matter"
Chris,It does matter because it changes the timing
Chris,Milliseconds matter
Chris,"a wavedash is the same input, you just have to do it ever so slightly earlier"
Chris,no different than any other input

Chris,It would be awesome if we could get that many teams
Chris,50 50 split would be more fun imo
Chris,nah
Chris,We shall vote
Chris,then it would all end in 1 fight
Chris,good point
Chris,"with smaller teams, the fights will be more spread out"
Chris,but if someone dies super early thats so lame
Chris,and 2v1 comebacks are much more possible than like 2v6
Chris,They can spectate
Chris,pvp gives me depression
Chris,that's sometimes almost as fun as playing
Chris,no it aint
Chris,We will be having a grace period
Chris,everyone will be safe for some amount of time
Chris,trap team with me pls
Chris,@Trapezoider
Chris,@Trapezoider I'll need to go over some standard rules to prevent stalling before we play
Chris,ye youre my team
Chris,aavaaa
Chris,Max make the rules and put them in the Realm channel
Chris,someone stop letting max make the rules
Chris,no mining?
Chris,tf?
Chris,These are standard rules
Chris,without them it is impossible to find anyone
Chris,no Branch minding Devin!
Chris,All major UHC games follow that rule
Chris,wow you're supposed to be my main man matt but you dont even know how to spell my name
Chris,"first of all, I'm not your bud.
second, is it Kevin or Devin? you keep changing it"
Chris,first of all
Chris,i am your bud
Chris,second of all
Chris,kevin is my persona my irl name has always been Devon
Chris,no one likes u kevn
Chris,
Chris,"@Max  I say Nether should be allowed, but only for Blaze Rods."
Chris,also... I'm not sure about enchanting
Chris,The point of banning the nether is so you can't hide in it
Chris,agree no nether
Chris,hmm that's a good point.
Chris,I would like no enchanting
Chris,"Also, is this team based or no?"
Chris,@Trapezoider hey fucker
Chris,"The reason for the nether, diamond, and enchantment bans is to try and speed up the game by vastly reducing the amount of time people need to spend gathering resources."
Chris,"Not sure if everyone wants this, but I think it would be more fun."
Chris,is this team based or no?
Chris,We are planning on having teams
Chris,ok
Chris,I say we have a grace period until the end of the first Minecraft day
Chris,day or day and night?
Chris,from sunrise Day 1 to sunrise day 2
Chris,day and night
Chris,I mean we could always just go off of the honour system to not hide
Chris,there are some people on here I don't trust to do that
Chris,Also we could say that after x amount of time we get teleported to spawn to finish so it doesn't last forever
Chris,"Even with no hiding, by banning these things we will reduce the amount of time needed to acquire maximum strength gear"
Chris,I trust everyone here
Chris,points to Devin
Chris,"That is my main reason, not to prevent hiding."
Chris,@Jed
Chris,why did you hey fucker
Chris,Whats up
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,can you take a break to join for the realms thing big guy?
Chris,in like an hour
Chris,I don't think he owns Minecraft
Chris,really? I thought he was there last time we made a realm
Chris,"I mean, I don't think banning things like diamonds and the nether are gonna be fun. I think you should be able to use whatever you find"
Chris,at least allow diamonds
Chris,We can discuss this in detail when we decide the final rules later.
Chris,but then ppl will spend forever looking for them and thats boring
Chris,^^^^
Chris,"also, if we're doing custom terrain, we can lower diamond spawn rates making it harder to get them"
Chris,That would lead to even more time farming though
Chris,Not if you can't strip mine. People will have to leave their caves eventually
Chris,
Chris,I'm not for lowering the rates of ores
Chris,Kinda lame
Chris,only diamond
Chris,just diamonds
Chris,Still
Chris,If anything make them more common
Chris,Lowering diamonds makes others more common?
Chris,"No, I mean make diamonds more common so you don't have to spend as long searching for them."
Chris,but then everyone will have diamond gear
Chris,so?
Chris,well I guess that's fair kinda fair...
Chris,makes fights last longer
Chris,true
Chris,yeah
Chris,We could also give everyone 20 hearts with commands
Chris,You guys want that?
Chris,I like that
Chris,ye
Chris,Keep figuring this out and tell me what to do when we start
Chris,Are we gonna have a world border?
Chris,of course
Chris,Can we do a shrinking border then?
Chris,are we playing on the latest snap shot or 1.12?
Chris,"@Trapezoider If you want this to go more smoothly, be sure to make me an OP on your new server"
Chris,"can we make a rule that if someone dies randomly from falling they can come back to life, I feel like that is going to happen and it will be super lame"
Chris,No
Chris,That won't happen
Chris,no
Chris,it might
Chris,Just don't die from fall damage
Chris,Easy
Chris,yeah
Chris,^
Chris,its no t
Chris,just watch what you're doing at all times
Chris,>.>
Chris,I'm planning on having health regen on by the way
Chris,Survival of the fittest mother fucker
Chris,Having it off penalizes you for taking fights
Chris,so are we playing in the latest snapshot or 1.12?
Chris,I would say 1.12
Chris,"well hold on, I want to check if 1.13 is out, I don't think it is... but I want to check"
Chris,it is on pre-release
Chris,will that do? or still on 1.12?
Chris,@Max
Chris,Whatever the realm allows for
Chris,what time are we starting?
Chris,After the Sony E3 event
Chris,not sure when that is
Chris,ask Andrew
Chris,I'm just going to be here
Chris,@Trapezoider  what time is Sony E3 over?
Chris,idk
Chris,im not watching it
Chris,Can you declare a start time then? Otherwise it will be left ambiguous and it will never happen.
Chris,Sony ends at 10 ish

Chris,"Kameron pulled a hunger games move, except he wasn't one of the last two people alive"
Chris,yeah
Chris,whats the zombie swarm mechanic?
Chris,Hitting zombies spawns more zombies
Chris,More smash 5 on stream
Chris,That are aggro on you
Chris,smash 5 stylistically looks much more developed than 4
Chris,I agree
Chris,The game looks good
Chris,it looks visually complete
Chris,this game suz
Chris,Let's hope it feels good
Chris,worse than maxs retard fort
Chris,smash 4 just was missing some stuff visually
Chris,so is this game
Chris,:/
Chris,Andrew how does this game look bad?

Chris,H
Chris,O

Chris,Thanks buddy
Chris,I gotchu
Chris,Who ever is playing pac man right now sucks real bad
Chris,Yo what are the command seals in fate zero
Chris,im confused
Chris,They allow you to give your servant a command that they cannot refuse regardless of how they personally feel about the order
Chris,HOw many times can you USE them
Chris,3
Chris,Ohhhh
Chris,Why are they using items on this stream
Chris,cause it's the casual stream

Chris,Former rocket scientist
Chris,Feelsbad
Chris,f
Chris,he said the devs are still making changes
Chris,Maybe there is hope
Chris,Feedback from melee players will hopefully help
Chris,well I've lost all interest in this game
Chris,knockback looks so wack
Chris,you fly super far super fast and then just stop
Chris,that's gonna mess with combos pretty hard I'm guessing
Chris,"no ledge hog, no wave stuff, same top tier as smash 4, no  dash dance, resident sleeper"
Chris,fingers crossed for it improving in the interm
Chris,cause they'll probably get a lot of feedback from the competitive people who want some changes
Chris,yes and nintendo will TOTALLY listen to that /s
Chris,shhh let me live in my happy little bubble
Chris,ok sorry
Chris,this is pretty cringe
Chris,I use that word sparingly
Chris,"desk guy: ""everyone's hoping for that 7th map""
the entire chat: ""4-0 pls"""
Chris,"If the numbers each character was given in the smash 5 trailer corresponds to the order they were created (which I think they said was the case), then the long held theory of roy and game and watch being created last and being incomplete has finally been confirmed."
Chris,2-2 rip
Chris,resident sleeper
Chris,I'm reading reddit and people seem to think that ledge hogging in a game is bad and I honestly don't understand why
Chris,it literally doubles the amount of ways that you can feasibly kill your opponent and thus makes the game more interesting and complex
Chris,what's even the point of ledges if they don't do anything?
Chris,it begins

Chris,Where is it at

Chris,Nintendo @ E3: Day 1
Chris,lol already we've got mango chants
Chris,crowd chanting mango
Chris,mango chant
Chris,lol
Chris,we all thought the same thing
Chris,were they not allowed to wear their team's jerseys?
Chris,prolly not cause it's pure nintendo sponsored
Chris,also why is vish's mic so quiet
Chris,Vish's mic is broken I think
Chris,I think we are hearing auditorium speaker audio through the other people's mics
Chris,This better be 1v1s
Chris,why wouldnt it be?
Chris,oh well nevermind
Chris,The smash 4 invitational was 4 player ffa
Chris,this is actually a pretty neat format
Chris,zero armada is probably a busted team tho
Chris,not really
Chris,They have the smash ball on
Chris,I mean the bracket format
Chris,^
Chris,of dubs -> singles
Chris,cringey announcer
Chris,funnyskit tho
Chris,I figured armada would pick pokemon trainer because he really likes ivysaur
Chris,cheering for zero armada
Chris,you can act out of airdodge
Chris,it's got some lag tho
Chris,that map was wack
Chris,oh they play one map
Chris,lol 2nd at evo 2017... someone's got their info wrong
Chris,"2015, yes, 2017 no"
Chris,unlucky
Chris,bayo looks more reasonable now
Chris,he stuff's got more knockback
Chris,you know the slowmo prolly makes it really easy to di
Chris,but you still CAN do the old combos but it's way harder
Chris,hopefully you can turn slowmo off
Chris,"also, while there's no lcancelling it looks like you've got way less landing lag on stuff"
Chris,I might main bayo
Chris,its a consideration
Chris,They haven't even shown how each character plays yet
Chris,My list of potential mains is rather long
Chris,Just because they were good in smash 4 doesn't really mean they will continue to be good with all these new characters
Chris,True beans
Chris,there are only 2 new characters
Chris,Still more characters than smash 4
Chris,Things can change
Chris,They only have access to 30 characters right now
Chris,hbox v reggie again
Chris,LETS GET SOME 1V1
Chris,Random cosplayers?
Chris,wutface
Chris,Obese Ness lol
Chris,they're all fat]
Chris,Wtf
Chris,Ness is sweatin'
Chris,Lucky thought that game was a ffa match LOLOLOL
Chris,He was attacking Mr. R on purpose
Chris,derp
Chris,wat
Chris,the legend
Chris,Lol
Chris,zero's prolly got this in the bag
Chris,Where's the Charizard
Chris,pokemon trainer looks kinda neat tho
Chris,I think if you work out the changes mid-combo 'n stuff you've got some tricks
Chris,This doesn't look that good
Chris,armada didn't really do anything with it tho
Chris,also ike looks sick
Chris,he's so fast
Chris,F MangO
Chris,mewtwo's sooo fast
Chris,hot damn
Chris,that was actually pretty good
Chris,and they were using wavelands and stuff
Chris,My man plup
Chris,I have faith in this game being good
Chris,is this genesis?
Chris,Items 
Chris,I mean yeah the items were a bit weird
Chris,THAT AINT ZELDA
Chris,but the standard play was legit
Chris,It looked real nice
Chris,I want to see the finals
Chris,Snake vs Sheik
Chris,sure the combos aren't stellar but it looks like it's got setups and such that you didn't have as much in sm4sh
Chris,hopefully no items
Chris,that was actually pretty hype at the end
Chris,like you've got post-combo positioning setups that look real good
Chris,WHY
Chris,this is so pointless
Chris,shhh
Chris,it's pandering to hte casuals
Chris,"Pointless, unless they bring out actual people"
Chris,who are these people??
Chris,Who are these people?
Chris,Who TF???
Chris,I mean there was an ign person
Chris,but I dunno
Chris,these are pretty meh vips
Chris,just give me reggie vs hbox
Chris,^
Chris,Tfw they play DK crew song when a big black guy comes on stage 
Chris,i know blacknerdcomedy has a youtube
Chris,which is quite popular
Chris,well  its already over
Chris,that kyogre sweep lol
Chris,I think Zelda and Sheik are the same character again
Chris,they said no
Chris,they showed up as different characters in the initial intro
Chris,The girl's name is Zelda
Chris,Not the character
Chris,I see
Chris,"remeber kids, Animal Crossing teaches you that Taxation is theft"
Chris,sheik looks really fun
Chris,COMBOS
Chris,OMG
Chris,yo that was nutty
Chris,Sheik looks really fun
Chris,That was insane
Chris,they both look super fun
Chris,Dang
Chris,actual combos
Chris,MKleo dropped the ball
Chris,also snake's uptilt's the same lol
Chris,i already said both those things max
Chris,naw that was honestly all zero
Chris,he's a sneaky bastard
Chris,it's nuts
Chris,The set up from snake in the beginning of the final stock
Chris,This game looks dope
Chris,wait is there rage?
Chris,I actually want a switch now
Chris,yeah :(
Chris,rip
Chris,if the game's this intense day 1 I'm looking forward to it
Chris,rage is actually the most dumb mechanic
Chris,like sure there's some clear similarities to sm4sh so people get a head start but still
Chris,yeah rage is weird
Chris,rage?
Chris,"higher your %, more knockback"
Chris,ah
Chris,makes it super hard to kill when you're at low % and easy to make comebacks
Chris,and also hard to combo low % people when you're at high %
Chris,How did MKLeo all 3 of those characters
Chris,I mean
Chris,2 smash 4 top tiers and snake
Chris,or it makes it easier to roll your opponent @Sak von Sak
Chris,"it seems like it was gonna make heavies really good cause they can live to high percents and kill before other people get to high, but heavies still kinda sucked"
Chris,yeah that too
Chris,Bay Vs. Ride mhmmm
Chris,wtf is that down B!?!
Chris,wait wat
Chris,how did he die at 17%
Chris,items LOL
Chris,lol
Chris,lol bayo
Chris,fuck
Chris,Bayo needs to be nerfed
Chris,she's back
Chris,FML
Chris,She looks kind of fun not gonna lie
Chris,true
Chris,she's just old dumb bayo
Chris,gimme interesting bayo
Chris,not the same combo
Chris,although that might have been partially just ridley being huge
Chris,^ yeah
Chris,but sstill
Chris,that was hella dumb
Chris,bigger hitbox = easy combo
Chris,still the fact that she can do that to anyone is depressing
Chris,she is just dumb combo
Chris,Hype best of 3
Chris,maybe 2 sets
Chris,tfw WWE super star and it is not John Cena
Chris,oh hype spirit tracks music
Chris,I think
Chris,LOL WUT
Chris,nairo with a bunch of scrubs?
Chris,this is gonna be a slaughter
Chris,Nairo about to destroy some noobs
Chris,who allowed this
Chris,lololol
Chris,Secretly pro players
Chris,he's still gonna slaughter em
Chris,Lol
Chris,3 v 1 
Chris,3v1
Chris,items and no team attack might swing it a bit
Chris,this is great
Chris,Can Nairo do it?
Chris,no
Chris,Nairo is about to get raped
Chris,he can but it'll be tough
Chris,items are good
Chris,he's one of the best sm4sh players
Chris,like the big three are zero mkleo and him
Chris,SNAKE!?!
Chris,also nairo's got a chance cause I think he just needs the most kills total
Chris,the crowd is singing the DK RAP LOL
Chris,i thought its was stocks ez for nairo
Chris,the taunt combo
Chris,poggers
Chris,what a god
Chris,+30 win inbound
Chris,
Chris,picking a heavy was pretty smart
Chris,I want to see the score ffs
Chris,Finally no items
Chris,or smash balls
Chris,and best of 3
Chris,lets go
Chris,mildly serious match
Chris,and a real stage
Chris,zero playing smash 4 lol
Chris,
Chris,bayo's not as busted hurray
Chris,it was just ridley being massive
Chris,I'm glad the neutral b has more knockback tho cause it suuuucked before
Chris,good balancing act
Chris,The bullets?
Chris,yeah
Chris,bullets were as if fox had 2 guns
Chris,is MkLeo going to de throne ZeRo?
Chris,dunno if really counts as a dethroning
Chris,zero's been retired
Chris,true
Chris,how old is ZeRo
Chris,?
Chris,mid twenties I think?
Chris,mkleo's like seventeen tho
Chris,he is 23
Chris,just found it online
Chris,the end of a pro gamer age is around 23-25 apparently
Chris,Why does Mario have no moves with Cappy? 
Chris,cause then he would be garbage lol
Chris,unless they were to make it like link's boomerang
Chris,I mean there's a lot of smashers over 25
Chris,most good csgo players are > 25
Chris,zero didnt permenantly retire
Chris,Why did he retire?
Chris,stress
Chris,the Brain in the Human body starts to decline brain activity around 25 and onward
Chris,It may not be this case
Chris,thats not true
Chris,excuse me?
Chris,Do you really want to do this over the knowledge of the human body?
Chris,the reason most esports players retire is burnout not physical decline
Chris,"After 25 your reaction time, multitasking capability and and memory begin to slip."
Chris,"Mario vs. Sonic
ResidentSleeper"
Chris,Where's your source?
Chris,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319185.php
Chris,What happens to the brain as we age?
Chris,The brain begins to decline with age. We examine what happens to the brain over time and whether the rate of decline can be slowed or even prevented.

Chris,How Your Brain Changes With Age
Chris,"Take control of your brain health by learning about how your brain changes as you age, and techniques to stay sharp."
Chris,Not like it matters cause when I showed you sources before you did not take it seriously anyways lol
Chris,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19542656/your-brain-as-you-age/
Chris,Has Your Brain Already Peaked?
Chris,New research from MIT suggests that mental decline begins far younger than is typically thought
Chris,anyways
Chris,YAY ZeRo!
Chris,yeah but neither of those things is super important for smash
Chris,and it's such a slow decline at first
Chris,that experience is more important
Chris,"like, there's street fighter players in their 30's"
Chris,"very true, exactly"
Chris,wow daigo is 37
Chris,I didn't realize he was that old
Chris,people with higher still take longer to age
Chris,the age of retirement for both sports and esports is getting higher and higher
Chris,so it the age of how long people live
Chris,your point?
Chris,federer is almost 37 and he still dominates when he is playing well
Chris,that is my point
Chris,i was just noting something interesting
Chris,is he a very high skilled player?
Chris,like Top teir?
Chris,leffen on the right
Chris,both players me and kameron have mentioned are old and still top 5 in their respective (e)sports
Chris,then it is a correlation between the amount of skill the person has and the rate that the skill of a person declines. All I was saying is that the decline starts at the approximate age of 25. nothing else.
Chris,you said their careers are basically over at 25
Chris,which is provably not true
Chris,hell it should be even worse in sports cause your physical skills also decline but it's still entirely possible to keep at it
Chris,"I said ""the end"" not drop dead over  or done."
Chris,The ending of a carrer does not have to be a drop dead date just a time period
Chris,Is anything else happening today or is that it?
Chris,I thought we were getting some sort of reveal
Chris,Stream went dark
Chris,F
Chris,Is it over then?
Chris,weird ass ending

if list is sorted
    return list
else
    destroy the universe"

Chris,@Max where you at homie
Chris,@Homies my parents dont think I should use the PC tonight
Chris,Because concussion
Chris,how bad is it?
Chris,It's extra strong yeet 90%
Chris,@Jed if you see Astoria at camp tell her she's a crazy bitch
Chris,How did you get that diagnosed already?
Chris,"Didnt actually. ER wait times were a few hours so I yoted home. I feel better though. Might be something minor, I did black  out though LOL"
Chris,Hours long wait times at the ER sounds dangerous
Chris,you get bumped at ER based on seriousness of your condition
Chris,"hence how that time I thought I might have broken my wrist, I was in a nearly empty ER and still had a super long wait casue people with more pressing stuff kept showing up"
Chris,"also, be very careful about concussions, if it's not feeling better tomorrow get it checked out"
Chris,"cause they can cause serious long-term problems, especially if you don't realize you have one"
Chris,@Trapezoider
Chris,I am going to see my actual doctor tomorrow
Chris,@Sak von Sak when did you break your wrist
Chris,"I didn't, but I did do a decent amount of damage"
Chris,in an entertainly stupid sequence of events
Chris,"my house is near the top of a hill, and me and my brother decided it'd be fun to go down the hill on these -"
Chris,"together, holding on to one another"
Chris,m
Chris,or
Chris,on
Chris,and taking turns throwing the other person further down to pick up speed
Chris,and then their extra speed would be a boost to the other person
Chris,"basically we eventually messed up, I hit a lawn, flew over it onto the sidewalk, and caught all my weight on a bad angle on my wrist"
Chris,"it didn't break, but I messed up the bone and the connective tissue and stuff"
Chris,hurt like hell
Chris,and I was still in a sling/brace for a few weeks
Chris,sylki
Chris,you are a god damned legend
Chris,@The Rona
Chris,help us find your island
Chris,we are finna tryna connect it
Chris,There's a nether portal to it
Chris,through my portal?
Chris,yeah but we wanna railway
Chris,Look at the coordinates
Chris,"pffft today I learned that there's a speedrunning category for ocarina of time called ""dank percent"" where the goal is to get off a bug that makes it look like link is smoking a giant blunt as fast as you can"
Chris,yee
Chris,and it's officially recognized on speedrun.com
Chris,world record at just over eight and a half minutes
Chris,I'm just skimming the other officially recognized categories for this game and some are hilarious
Chris,"like ""Go Home and Die %"", where the goal is to die while inside a house as fast as possible"
Chris,What is the record for that one?
Chris,8m18s
Chris,there's also a category to complete the game without ever opening any doors
Chris,"there's a category to complete the game all the way to the water temple, and then while inside get to a total of 37 small keys"
Chris,@Sak von Sak have you seen full metal alchemist
Chris,he thinks its overrated
Chris,i think zacks overrated
Chris,ava sums it up nicely
Chris,"it's a solid show, but beyond the first chunk I felt like it just gets larger, more unweildy, and slower, and nothing it does beyond a few early bits really stood out to me"
Chris,it just feels like a decently executed generic show that gets worse as it goes on
Chris,"I agree, full metal alchemist is overrated."
Chris,"I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it, at least not before a lot of other things"
Chris,Especially brotherhood.
Chris,"I haven't seen the original, but from what I've heard, it's even more filled with fluff"
Chris,I'm one of those people who doesn't watch main stream anime. I stick to the more lesser know stuff.
Chris,"And to me, (a true anime fan), main stream animes are just... Not good animes."
Chris,how do you define a true anime fan
Chris,?
Chris,A true anime fan is someone who enjoys other animes then mainstream.
Chris,"I would have gone with just ""a person who enjoys anime, regardless of other peoples' opinions of any given anime"""
Chris,"Also, I feel like to be a true anime fan, you have to watch at least 5 different animes that aren't mainstream."
Chris,also just in general I feel like there's literally no reason to subdivide a community and it'll only cause problems and toxicity and elitism
Chris,both of those defintion are super arbitrary
Chris,being a fan should be whatever you think it is
Chris,True.
Chris,I'm only saying what I define it as for myself
Chris,idk i just find the gate keeping shit to be really autistic
Chris,"@mrd256  stop being an elitist, that is so stupid. Anyone who says you have to watch non-mainstream anime to be a ""true anime fan"" is just trying way too hard to look cool and feel above other people. It literally doesn't matter at all. You're not special because you watch things that less people think are good. Get off your high horse."
Chris,"Also, as someone who had an obsession with Yu-gi-oh for years you have no right to try to be cool lol"
Chris,"on another note you said watch five anime that aren't mainstream. FIVE???? That's it? If you want to go on about ""true anime fans"" it should at least be someone who has seen a heck of a lot of anime. My list is up in the 80's (which isn't even all that much). Beat that, rookie."
Chris,Who said I only watched five?
Chris,"okay hot shot, how much anime have you watched?"
Chris,but honestly it doesn't even matter
Chris,people are entitled to like whatever anime they like and I think all people's opinions are equally valid because they're just opinions about stupid entertainment media and it doesn't matter
Chris,and this is coming from someone who has watch both mainstream and non-mainstream anime
Chris,"@Feral Nebula It's probably not as much as you, but I have watched more than 5
Owari no Seraph
Ore no Twintail narimasu
Kissxsis
High School DXD
Date A Live
Angel Beats
Charlotte
Erased (even though I hated it)
Fuuka 
Rakudai kishi no Cavalry
Miira no Kaitaka
The Devil is a part timer
Shinmai Maou no Testament
Caligula
and I can list more if I need to"
Chris,I didn't need a list lol
Chris,you asked for it
Chris,that's only 14 lol
Chris,and isn't Kissxsis an incest anime ???
Chris,still more than 5!
Chris,isn't it hentai?
Chris,but it's a gulty pleasure
Chris,pffft
Chris,no it's not a hentai
Chris,I stay away from hentai at all costs
Chris,okay buddy
Chris,also tbh most of those anime ARE mainstream. Maybe not as mainstream as naruto or FMAB but they are still well known. And the ones that aren't on your list are just plain bad lol
Chris,well yeah
Chris,then what kinda point are you tryna prove ????
Chris,"big animes like Naruto, One Piece, Boku no Hero Academia, FLCL, and others of such are ones I try to stay away from"
Chris,FLCL????
Chris,is that mainstream??
Chris,the new series
Chris,I forget what it's called.
Chris,I know what you're talking about but that anime is not mainstream as much as naruto ect.
Chris,"whatever, believe what you want to believe"
Chris,lol okay
Chris,have fun thinking you're cooler than you are
Chris,the real answer is none of us are cool because we all watch anime
Chris,coming from a girl says she's a weeboo
Chris,"I just called myself uncool too, you know"
Chris,but the weeb thing is a joke. I'm not the actual definition of a weeaboo
Chris,I never said I was cool. I was just trying to say I don't like to watch (many) mainstream animes
Chris,"right, but when people are being elitist they are trying to make themselves look higher than others"
Chris,"""a true anime fan"""
Chris,I'm just trying to say that is a toxic mindset
Chris,I didn't say I was the only one
Chris,I didn't say you said that wym ???
Chris,throws arms in the air and gives up
Chris,later
Chris,haha
Chris,I'm so amused
Chris,"slides back in briefly
in all fairness, as much as the 'true anime fan' thing is often toxic and elitest, the majority of the toxicity and elitism in this conversation is coming from ava"
Chris,"so get off yo high horse, ava"
Chris,whaaaaat
Chris,Im not ! !
Chris,   thank you Zack!
Chris,people who use that emoji unironically should die
Chris,it's just hard to talk to stupid people so I'm sorry if I sounded toxic
Chris,"let's see:
you called him a rookie,
one of his shows a hentai,
laughed at his guilty pleasure,
told him most of what he'd seen was bad,
etc., I'm too lazy to pick through the rest of this"
Chris,also that is one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard
Chris,because you insulted him during the apology
Chris,I largely agree with your general opinion about stuff but you're arguing it so badly
Chris,I wasn't trying to be sincere lol
Chris,also I called it a hentai because i genuinely thought it was
Chris,whoops
Chris,but anyway I was saying all that stuff because he thought he was too good and I wanted to knock him down I guess
Chris,"anyhoo, this whole discussion is such a mess that I would genuinely prefer to go back to work than continue having it, so I'm out"
Chris,woah
Chris,sorry Sylki
Chris,well that conversation got out of hand real fast lol
Chris,Holy shit
Chris,I ask Zack if he has seen a show I'm watching
Chris,And the retard fort opens the floodgates of autism
Chris,"goddammit I'm on hold and they go ""press the pound sign to not have to listen to music"""
Chris,so I did
Chris,and instead they're now just advertising themselves
Chris,this is not what I wanted
Chris,Who you calling sylk boi
Chris,a hosting service cause the hosting's all fucked up
Chris,why are all the hardest parts of getting a website going things that have nothing to do with making the website
Chris,i know right its some stupid ass shit
Chris,@Zain has Daniel contacted you? I think I'm going to rape him on your behalf
Chris,no not yet

Chris,okay
Chris,Keep listening to 500 miles
Chris,HOpe you can find a solution to whatever problems are plagueing your work
Chris,"it's like,

Chris,"I mean, you don't see any marios in top 10 these days"
Chris,he's 15th now
Chris,I was saying that we had figured out he was bad
Chris,"it's more just, how had top players not figured out how to beat roy"
Chris,This guy must have just been good
Chris,"Also, the cc meta pretty much didn't exist then"
Chris,fair
Chris,"still, step it up 2005 melee"
Chris,If any of us went back to 2004-5 melee we probably could have been top players. With how far the meta has come I imagine an average player today could be excellent

Chris,That was so close
Chris,he'd better go ham in loser's

Chris,I've ended up half working and half watching other games cause melee's still pretty meh for the most part
Chris,I'm currently watching one of the most busted and poorly balanced fighting games of all time that's being run at a side event at evo
Chris,Which game is that?
Chris,it's this ancient snes sailor moon fighting game
Chris,"there's two torontonians in winner's finals, so I'm hyped for that, I guess"
Chris,also they both play hilariously busted characters so I can't wait to see that match
Chris,link?
Chris,"one character has absurd range on all her moves, a full screen dash, and a really strong command grab
the other one is crazy fast, and if they get under around 1/6 health they can stall infinitely and slowly chip you down until you have less health than them at timeout and they win"

Chris,"lololol toph's playing and his full tag shows up as ""THE READS Toph"""
Chris,yo who won the wobbles kjh set @Sak von Sak
Chris,kjh
Chris,wobbles wasn't wobbling
Chris,he did some cool handoffs though
Chris,he prolly wants to commentate
Chris,I figure he's mostly just there to have fun
Chris,and also commentate
Chris,but yeah
Chris,goddammit
Chris,the stream went down and this is the last thing we see

Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,Finna fight me at 9:15
Chris,good sheik players make sheik look like such a good character
Chris,whereas bad spacies make spacies look trash lol
Chris,I dont get why fox players ban to battlefield vs sheik
Chris,when most sheik players counterpick battlefield
Chris,just ban bfield and then FOD or yoshis based on preference
Chris,they could leverage the stage advantage so much more
Chris,"As a sheik player, which stage do you prefer against foxes"
Chris,i mean it doesnt really matter cause im not very good
Chris,colbol beat amsa
Chris,imo the fox-yoshi matchup is like 65-35
Chris,RISHI BEAT M2K
Chris,SMASH GOD
Chris,wouldnt it be sick if there was a top player who was a puff/marth dual main?
Chris,like what if hbox had m2k's marth
Chris,Then they would be unstoppable
Chris,@Mr. Airplane wanna watch Evo when I get home from work?
Chris,melee with the most viewers at evo rn

Chris,@Zain Is darwin project good?
Chris,I like it
Chris,Is it a game that could be played together or is it only solo queue?
Chris,@Melee this training pack is actually really really cool
Chris,highly recommended
Chris,Lololol I didn't see sm4sh grands but what I'm hearing about it sounds hilarious
Chris,Bayo dittos
Chris,Whole crowd booing
Chris,Apparently at one point they both sat on opposite ends of the stage and charged neutral b for so long a TO had to come out and give them shit about it
Chris,Game's dead I think
Chris,Or maybe this is what happens when #1 and #2 can't make evo
Chris,Nobody fucking cares about that game anymore
Chris,Melee is still hype
Chris,Bayo and Cloud were the worst things to ever happen to smash 4
Chris,It was pretty balanced before then
Chris,The list of viable characters was pretty long
Chris,But still fundamentally boring to play and watch
Chris,They are playing the DK rap on the evo stream lol
Chris,"also, at least cloud is actually fairly fun to watch, compared to a lot of the cast"
Chris,bayo not so much
Chris,Guy with a smash ultimate shirt standing behind the players
Chris,Announcement incoming?
Chris,I think the leaks said something was supposed to get announced at evo
Chris,They did
Chris,"and even without that, evo's a pretty good time to announce anything about a fighting game"
Chris,I think a few other games have had little announcements already
Chris,hey I overslept is this the first match @Max
Chris,There have not been any games yet
Chris,fantastic
Chris,did i miss anything on the stream
Chris,no
Chris,fantastic
Chris,YO HBOX
Chris,he just took 3 stocks in like 40 seconds
Chris,why did he ban fd and not stadium?
Chris,I think FD is worse
Chris,Right call imo
Chris,hot take leffen wins evo
Chris,Lets go
Chris,wow
Chris,"3 stock in hbox's favour, last hit, 3 stock in leffen's favour"
Chris,wack set
Chris,just to note my message was before stock 1 of the 3rd game
Chris,Amazing not to tilt after game 1
Chris,although real talk hbox was flubbing left and right
Chris,I say he's either gonna crumble or go on a nutty loser's run
Chris,time to cheer for wizzy over swedish
Chris,no
Chris,swedish
Chris,lets go
Chris,@Zain Mango about to play
Chris,alrightr
Chris,"I like swedish, but wizzy has a much much better record over hbox"
Chris,yeah of da sheiks
Chris,https://www.twitch.tv/evo
Chris,evo - Twitch
Chris,EVO 2018 - CHAMPIONSHIP SUNDAY
Chris,also swedish has looked good against hbox in da past
Chris,and plup beat him with sheik at CEO
Chris,We could have armada Hbox for 4th
Chris,plup is so good
Chris,and mango so bad
Chris,rip mango
Chris,that
Chris,was so sad
Chris,that was a very mango set
Chris,That was pretty good
Chris,"he played amazing for a chunk of it, mediocre for a chunk, and SD'd a bunch"
Chris,the first game was sick by plup tho
Chris,yaw first game plup was playing out of his mind
Chris,New gods winners finals
Chris,lets go
Chris,big house part 2
Chris,This is winnable
Chris,S2J has almost beat him before
Chris,"and when he did, he won the first two games"
Chris,which would be the set in this case
Chris,that'd be crazy though
Chris,I'd put like 80/20 odds on armada winning
Chris,shoutouts2jesus
Chris,
Chris,?
Chris,That's s2j
Chris,oh
Chris,someone said in chat
Chris,armada has gotten 3 stitches since being put in losers
Chris,the script boys
Chris,damnn
Chris,those stocks were spicy
Chris,SHOUTOUTS TO JESUS
Chris,hes losing on fod tho
Chris,He might opt for fd instead
Chris,huh
Chris,bfield?
Chris,S2J can do this
Chris,I wanna see armada mango
Chris,not s2j mango
Chris,chokes
Chris,rip
Chris,so many special turnips
Chris,chooooookes
Chris,s2j choked that so hard
Chris,S2j is out?
Chris,"Hey guys, I'm here from Guilty Gear, just wanted to say that I can see why you were being a bunch of immature children in chat - seeing as you literally play a kids game. Honestly, it's just sad seeing you losers spam emotes every time Mario does his jump attack or whatever. Grow up!."
Chris,What is this copy pasta
Chris,From the chat
Chris,ik
Chris,@Trapezoider S2J is out but wizzy is still in
Chris,
Chris,Waiting for this special ed kid's game to be over so I can watch some fucking tekken.
Chris,same
Chris,I HAVE A 3 WORD ESSAY DUE TOMORROW AND I'M WATCHING MELEE NotLikeThis
Chris,Why is this Swedish dude wearing sunglasses
Chris,he has eye issues
Chris,its not just for style
Chris,is winners finals b05 or just losers and grands?
Chris,I think winners finals is bo5
Chris,Leffen said so on his twitter at least
Chris,Did you guys just see the camera?
Chris,well he could just be saying that because hes gonna be in either grands or losers finals
Chris,rip
Chris,wow mango
Chris,that was... pretty bad
Chris,how does he almost always play terrible at evo
Chris,we need a better bird player
Chris,He puts a lot of pressure on himself probably
Chris,the bird must fly again
Chris,"From chat ""we live in a world where s2j took a game off armada and mango didnt... hmmmm"""
Chris,lol
Chris,"real talk tho, mango was playing really sloppy"
Chris,like s2j game 3 slop
Chris,ouch wizzy
Chris,wizzy finna save melee?
Chris,The only falcon to ever play the character correctly
Chris,yeah n0ne of course
Chris,also 1/4 of both the top 12 and top 8 were falcon players thats pretty wack
Chris,its over
Chris,bruh
Chris,damn
Chris,damn
Chris,that was super close though
Chris,hbox's pressure was so good once he had the lead though
Chris,wizzy needed space and hbox wasn't giving him any
Chris,leffen unstopable
Chris,I'll stop him
Chris,go chris
Chris,fox ditto time?
Chris,lol
Chris,rip
Chris,Leffen is so good
Chris,My inspiration
Chris,he's crazy
Chris,plup is kinda like new mew2king
Chris,he gets deflated p easy
Chris,i dont see him winning in losers
Chris,ouch
Chris,yo boys we finna play some melee after evo
Chris,this is so tense
Chris,this aint even grands
Chris,ouch
Chris,Almost a time out
Chris,clutchbox please
Chris,@Max
Chris,is wizzy still here?
Chris,no
Chris,NO
Chris,well i have no reason to watch this tream then 
Chris,rip
Chris,Melee is saved
Chris,Thank god armada won
Chris,evo is hype
Chris,hes so chubby
Chris,watch anyway
Chris,yeeees armada
Chris,Hbox doesn't even have shoes on
Chris,guys can we joinup like????
Chris,This is hype city
Chris,leffen plup armada top 3 this is pretty much as well as I could have hoped for
Chris,
Chris,its not even grand finals
Chris,plup leffen grand finals
Chris,Lets go
Chris,that's what I'm hoping for
Chris,"I want fifteen games from hereon out, and I honestly don't really care that much how they go if we get that"
Chris,My boy big leff better win this
Chris,@Melee can we all joinup for grandfinals ples
Chris,not gonna lie armada winning would be sick
Chris,no
Chris,gay^
Chris,even though i dont likeem
Chris,I kinda want the armada insane loser's run
Chris,I want to listen to the casters
Chris,armada winning would mean beating 6 of the other top 9 members
Chris,and every other top 6 player
Chris,FROM LOSERS
Chris,who did wizrobe play before hbox knocked him out
Chris,i cant see on the bracket
Chris,to get the 3vo
Chris,swedish
Chris,which other evos did armada win
Chris,2015 2017
Chris,2017 and 2015
Chris,"over hbox in 2015, mango in 2017"
Chris,yeah
Chris,mango won 2013 and 14

Chris,1
Chris,is this live?
Chris,yes
Chris,:0
Chris,LETS GO PLUP
Chris,wait
Chris,was the rest of the bracket 2/3?
Chris,yes
Chris,wow
Chris,it's cause it's evo
Chris,they need it to run quickly enough
Chris,also the evo top brass don't much care for melee
Chris,hence our shitty time slot
Chris,why
Chris,we bring so much to the event
Chris,Thats so dumb
Chris,cause they're old school fgc people
Chris,Dont we literally get the most viewers?
Chris,"the main head guy apparently loooooves tekken even though it doesn't get as good viewership as melee, sf, dbfz and he gave tekken a ton of preferential treatment"
Chris,thats so dumb
Chris,i didnt know the evo staff was gay
Chris,randall!!
Chris,melee in particular has a history of getting shafted in various ways at evo
Chris,this year's the worst though probably
Chris,I missed most of top 8 because of this time slot
Chris,Armada hype
Chris,Didn't we get Saturday last year
Chris,oh yeah
Chris,but at least we didn't have super early morning pools
Chris,"""Whenever I see top players do what I do. Alarm bells"""
Chris,Scar is awesome
Chris,he's a good commentator for higher level discussion of stuff
Chris,"where he's not as deep in the nitty gritty details, but he understands players and mentalities really well"
Chris,Have toph and scar done every evo?
Chris,fox is stupid
Chris,no u
Chris,YES
Chris,up air is such a dumb move
Chris,"I don't think they did the super old school evos, but I'm pretty sure they've done top 8 or at least top 4 from 2013-2018"
Chris,jbaited
Chris,"honestly, it wouldn't feel like evo at this point without scar and toph"
Chris,they are such a good combo
Chris,armada 4 stock
Chris,also real talk
Chris,how many times has plup gotten 3rd at evo
Chris,+1 more times
Chris,I feel bad
Chris,yeah plup's not looking like his normal self
Chris,the boost grab he missed was so sad
Chris,
Chris,Time for leffen to take it
Chris,ever since he beat mango he's been not looking that good
Chris,"but yeah, I think this is... 3 or 4 now"
Chris,rip
Chris,poggers?
Chris,Nintendo direct in 3 days
Chris,
Chris,pfft nintendo cop out on making an actual announcement
Chris,poggers
Chris,they announced an announcement
Chris,what a bunch of fucking champs
Chris,I dont like the evo stage this year
Chris,it was way cooler last year
Chris,
Chris,WAIT ITS THE SAME?????? It looks so different from some of these angles
Chris,"I honestly don't really care who wins this, so long as this is as good as their sets normally are"
Chris,
Chris,that nose shine
Chris,Leffen looking fresh
Chris,holy shit
Chris,what a fucking god
Chris,"""proto tractor pro tractor"
Chris,what a fucking new god
Chris,what was that???

Chris,Kameron is the terran Zain is the zerg and Chris is the protoss
Chris,zack go back to work

Chris,I will get bodied
Chris,When is this happening
Chris,Tonight if everyone is available I think
Chris,I mean I think no matter what the team with me as the 'experienced' player is gonna get fucked
Chris,since it is a 1v1v1 you can always shift alliances depending on who is winning

Chris,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

Chris,The more you ask the furthur away it becomes
Chris,"Boys, I found a new game for us to play"
Chris,"I'll tell you guys about it later, but it's really fun"
Chris,@Homies
Chris,whats it called?
Chris,"""I'll tell you guys about it later"""
Chris,ffs tell us the name now
Chris,so we can look into it
Chris,and play it later
Chris,No
Chris,Tell us what it is
Chris,"Ok, you twisted my arm as far as it will go"
Chris,It's not on steam by the way
Chris,It's called
Chris,Primeops
Chris,It's free at
Chris,ProductofPrimes.itch.io/Primeops
Chris,The devs are a friend of my buddy
Chris,It's real fun
Chris,Also you're gonna need a controller to play
Chris,Will Xbox work?
Chris,I'll get it tonight
Chris,I'll be home at 7:30-8 pst
Chris,Yo boys my 28 yr/old retarded sister is finally moving out
Chris,HYPE
Chris,Xbox works
Chris,"pools commentary is, although kind of crap, perfectly fitting for pools"
Chris,they're not even talking about the set except for every now and then
Chris,they're just going off on ridiculous tangents about photosynthesis
Chris,"but like, it's sfat bodying some rando"
Chris,actual commentary would be kinda weird
Chris,holy shit mango almost lost that set
Chris,Who was he against?
Chris,some random puff
Chris,he's not even top 100
Chris,Was he playing Falco?
Chris,yeah
Chris,"lololol he just walked over to the commentary and goes ""no one ever talks about my good double lasers. Those were some good double lasers that set"""
Chris,nothing about the fact that he just went last hit with some non-top 100 player
Chris,"Ok @Homies I gotta break the news to you now, I don't think the game has online multiplayer"
Chris,bummer dude
Chris,I'm becoming more and more sure that hbox takes damage on purpose once he is at 50 until he is at around 90.
Chris,Why?
Chris,So that all the easy kill setups don't work
Chris,"at around 90 you can't really upthrow upair, weak nair upsmash, I dunno if jab upsmash works (I think jab upair still works but it's hard)"
Chris,Are you guys seeing this
Chris,basically your only safe-ish kill option becomes bair at like 140
Chris,Those drawings lol
Chris,"also, n0ne 3-1'd wizzy let's go"
Chris,he's gonna get bodied by zain probably though
Chris,When I play vs puff I actually don't laser past up throw up air %
Chris,also pewpewu vs s2j should be good
Chris,oh damn moky brought shroomed to game 5
Chris,lol n0ne
Chris,he was going so ham
Chris,and then he just
Chris,jumps in the middle of a marth combo
Chris,and that's that
Chris,Did mango drop out of shine?
Chris,naw
Chris,there's two brackets to top 8
Chris,this is only one half
Chris,there's still another 32 person bracket going on after this
Chris,These stats are so pointless
Chris,They should have the openings per kill stat
Chris,That is by far the best one
Chris,or edgeguard %
Chris,Yo
Chris,What tourney is going on?
Chris,shine 2018
Chris,S2J vs Wizzy about to start
Chris,I'm sure you want to see that one

Chris,we tryna play some games kids?
Chris,man plup had such a nice run to top 8
Chris,fairly weak puff -> samus ditto -> ics
Chris,"man why are they like ""in case you sheiks are struggling with this matchup, these tips might help!"""
Chris,they don't need the help
Chris,we samuses need the help
Chris,It is probably because neither of them know what help to give Samus. Sheik knowledge is much more widely known.
Chris,fair enough
Chris,"also, apparently void (the sm4sh guy) is pretty good at dbzf"
Chris,"he made top 8 at shine, which, while not super stacked, still has a few names I recognize"
Chris,admittadly they're both names I know from different games (one from skullgirls and one from p4au) but presumably they're still pretty good
Chris,What is p4au?
Chris,persona 4 arena
Chris,I'm not sure why they add the u
Chris,possibly the full title of one of the updates? persona 4 arena ultimax?
Chris,and also possibly cause p4a might be the acronym for persona 4 the animation
Chris,duuuuck that was a free fsmash
Chris,why did you try for bair
Chris,that only would have killed on sweet spot
Chris,I honestly think he might have taken that game if he'd just done fsmash
Chris,cause he would have been winning

things that I can pick out that tie these together: female singer, on the slower/sadder end of things, variable intensity between the verse and the chorus (like, the verses are a little tamer and then the chorus hits more of an emotional intensity)"

Chris,"so for some reason, in toronto all the weeklies I used to go to are on hiatus"
Chris,but I found that there's a weekly like fifteen minutes walk from my house
Chris,the only problem: it usually only gets been 3 and 6 entrants
Chris,"is it worth my time? it won't be a great tourney probably, and their schedule is wack as hell, probably to accomadate for the fact that they're running melee, sm4sh, and pm separately cause the venue is tiny"
Chris,"on the flip side, I've got a good chance of placing in the money"
Chris,I think you should go
Chris,I probably will
Chris,just to get a little melee in
Chris,and maybe I'll also try to farm the sm4sh tournament
Chris,Also
Chris,lets move the couch this afternoon
Chris,If you start going and other people see the increase in player count they will start going

print('\nInterest = %0.2f' %interest)



For some reason when I am testing this and entering the roi, it spits out this"
Chris,"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""F:\PROGRAMS\calculator.py"", line 4, in <module>
    years = input(int('Duration (no. of years) ?'))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Duration (no. of years) ?'"
Chris,should be int(input('duration'))
Chris,so I dont wanna use a float value for roi
Chris,OH
Chris,this is for years
Chris,did you read the error message?
Chris,it tells you which line is going wrong
Chris,and a description of why
Chris,IVE Never debugged
Chris,i didnt get what the mans was trying to tell me
Chris,im using Thonny as my editor
Chris,"in this case, that there was something going wrong with the int() funciton, specifically that the arguments you gave it were invalid"
Chris,"at the very least, that should tell you where and what is going wrong"
Chris,"it has the problem after the roi bit because once you input the roi, it tries to run the next line of code, which has the error"
Chris,i fixed it
Chris,now i got another bug
Chris,ayo
Chris,i made a calculator. @Sak von Sak whats another easy beginning project I can work on
Chris,one I had fun with was making a text adventure game
Chris,oh wow
Chris,that sounds difficult
Chris,ill give it a go
Chris,do you know how to do loops yet?
Chris,cause you're gonna need em
Chris,no sir
Chris,i know how to print
Chris,how to make variables
Chris,ok step one learn how to do for and while loops
Chris,that with what you already know should be enough
Chris,thank you sack
Chris,@Homies what's the biggest mistake New comers make when learning a programming language? What's the most common trap to fall into that will set you back instead of progressing your learning
Chris,this question makes no sense
Chris,yea
Chris,i mean i guess
Chris,i think people shouldnt focus
Chris,on syntax and the language in it self
Chris,more on what they wanna make in it
Chris,incorrect syntax
Chris,but i dont
Chris,think
Chris,theres
Chris,much that could set you back
Chris,when learning a language
Chris,Why would you need to need to make that 5 messages
Chris,"programming isn't like english where you can do something wrong without noticing, if something is wrong in programming it wont work period"
Chris,so if things are working you're gucci
Chris,and if they aren't figure out why
Chris,ayyy anyone wanna play some ow or melee later? @Homies

Chris,"A little tip that might help you @Trapezoider is to plan, either in your head or on a piece of paper, what the main function of your program is probably gonna look like"
Chris,ye
Chris,think about the process before the code
Chris,Just jumping straight into it can get confusing
Chris,and make you lose track
Chris,Planning I feel can also help with the efficiency of your program

Chris,I sure wouldn't write an essay like that
Chris,I mean
Chris,its an opinion so as long as its written well it'd work

Chris,@Zain Don't leave without talking with me real quick please
Chris,ok
Chris,"aight so if I get a switch it's ~$380, but if I get a switch and either BoTW or Odessey it's ~$420 (so basically $40 for a game I was planning on getting anyway)

which should I go for?"
Chris,Personally I think I would go for Odyssey
Chris,If you like more of a 3d platform-ish style with a more linear story
Chris,It's movement is fantastic and really satisfying to pull off
Chris,There is a lot of content in the game if you like going and collecting the moons
Chris,The puzzles in the game are fun and interesting
Chris,The capture mechanic is also really fun
Chris,..........
Chris,BotW on the other hand
Chris,Is more if you like an open world adventure type game with a non-linear story that you get to explore at your own discretion
Chris,I find the fighting very rewarding in this game but sometimes I feel that the weapons break too quickly for my liking
Chris,hm
Chris,"If you're looking for a traditional Zelda game with lots of dungeons and boss fights, there are only a handful of them in the game"
Chris,But I liked the shrines enough to fulfil the dungeon portion
Chris,I just wish there were more bosses
Chris,"The exploring and doing whatever you want though is the main draw for the game, collecting things to make food and potions, doing side quests, taking out hordes of enemies, completing shrines to upgrade yourself"
Chris,"I'm thinking I'll probably go with odessey, cause the other game I'm gonna get is xenoblade, which  will probably be good for my fix of more open world-ish stuff"
Chris,all the exploration stuff and the story stuff 'n stuff
Chris,Glad that I could help
Chris,
Chris,I'm planning on spending my entire first week's paycheck (after taxes) on games and stuff
Chris,"including a proper hard drive so I'll finally not be able to make the ""it won't fit on my teeny tiny hard drive"" excuse"
Chris,Zack make sure you get botw at some point
Chris,Definitely one of those games you really gotta play at some point

Chris,"for me personally, i feel like oddessy loses it's charm and collecting moons becomes boring after a while. while everytime i come back to zelda i learn something new or find more shit."
Chris,i have alot more hours into zelda and still feel like i haven't found everything
Chris,while oddessy feels like a grind
Chris,"350 ish hours into zelda
120 ish into oddessy"
Chris,"xenoblade is pretty linear btw. and bombards you with sidequests up the butt that you can't beat till later, or you do so many sidequests that you are overleveled"
Chris,also get the dlc for xenoblade its amazing
Chris,I will once I'm done the main game
Chris,I'm with rainbow on the Mario thing
Chris,I didn't even beat the game because I lost interest and found it boring
Chris,You guys are a couple of hosers
Chris,ill vacuum your fucking pork sword dweeb
Chris,Finish Odyssey then come talk to me
Chris,
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,melee?
Chris,"alright, I've now got a 2TB hard drive, a switch, two games for it, and pokemon sun arriving within the next week"
Chris,I am significantly less rich than I was ten minutes ago
Chris,feelsgoodman
Chris,wait did you choose oddessy or zelda
Chris,very important question
Chris,ZELDA IS BETTER AND HAS WAY MORE HOURS IN IT
Chris,im pretty sure you didnt read the entire thing correctly
Chris,you missed ODDESSY LOSES ITS CHARM
Chris,also zelda has more content than oddessy
Chris,especially if you include the dlc
Chris,you're all too late I got odessey already
Chris,i can lend you zelda
Chris,I'm gonna get both at some point and early on I'd rather have more gameplay variety
Chris,oh we should exchange switch codes
Chris,it won't arrive till tuesday
Chris,rip
Chris,I don't think Odyssey loses its charm at all
Chris,i meant more like. it doesnt captivate you to continue playing after you beat it
Chris,"i beat the main story, got like 50 more moons then got bored of the game"
Chris,because its the same shit
Chris,It did for me
Chris,I got all of them
Chris,Except like 2 because idk where they are
Chris,;-;
Chris,I got around 400 moons? i dont remember...
Chris,most of the moons are placed so easily
Chris,and served no challenge to me
Chris,the more challenging moons are placed so bs with no room for creativity
Chris,especially the darker side
Chris,I'm not saying oddessy is a bad game. im just saying that botw offers more. and would be the game i would recommend first.

Chris,Is this personality test even good? @SWIRL GIRL
Chris,there's no real evidence supporting its validity
Chris,I just think its fun to think about
Chris,the big five is another personality test that has a lot more research behind it if anyone wants another test to take
Chris,That's the good one
Chris,My distributions are as follows
Chris,"Openness: 93rd %
Conscientiousness: 67th %
Extraversion: 98th %
Agreeablesness: 0th%
Neuroticism: 3rd %"
Chris,@Trapezoider What trait would make someone have a high level of skepticism?
Chris,Low openness
Chris,And possibly high neuroticism
Chris,Both of which run in your family
Chris,Which family member are you referring to?
Chris,Both your mother and your father
Chris,You also got high conscientiousness from your dad

Chris,down to clown for a bit
Chris,is short hop needle cancel fair a thing? @Melee
Chris,cause I feels like that'd be pretty effective
Chris,I don't think a short hop provides enough airtime to both needle and do a fair.
Chris,it does I tested it
Chris,as long as you dont fast fall
Chris,you can do it
Chris,I would guess people avoid it because you can stil cc the fair while needle grab cannot be cc'd and it provides a greater potential punish.
Chris,no needle cancel fair
Chris,like threaten needles into fair
Chris,I've never really seen that
Chris,you cant needle into fair
Chris,or maybe like needle cancel tomahawk
Chris,@Max did you do thanksgiving dinner already
Chris,yes
Chris,same
Chris,My family prefers to do it more for lunch then for dinner
Chris,yuck
Chris,after reading reddit for awhile a lot of casual/smash 4 players seem to think melee sucks because a lot of characters are unviable and the roster is small
Chris,but like there are more varied character archetypes than any of the other games
Chris,and arguable still more viable characters than sm4sh lol

Chris,I found out who the guy banging on my door was
Chris,Who?
Chris,So
Chris,little background
Chris,Did you kick his ass?
Chris,Mike yesterday ordered a new microphone on Amazon
Chris,And it was supposed to come in today
Chris,Like before 9:00pm
Chris,So another little background
Chris,We never get stuff delivered to our door
Chris,because we are in a building and you need a key to access it
Chris,and our mailbox is too small
Chris,"so they leave it at the front desk of the main building, and they will send an email saying that they have your package"
Chris,"So he gets the email from the delivery man saying that the thing is delivered, and he's now waiting for the email from the front desk"
Chris,It's been like 30 minutes at this point
Chris,so he decides to check the original email
Chris,and in it there's a picture of the door to our room
Chris,with the package on the floor
Chris,So
Chris,This guy somehow got inside of our building
Chris,Went to our door
Chris,knocked
Chris,and fucking BOOKED IT
Chris,"Like I heard the knock, got up and peered through the peephole"
Chris,"and there was nothing, or nobody in the hallway"
Chris,"Again a knock, the same thing happens"
Chris,"nothing, and noone"
Chris,So it seems like this company hired literally the Flash to deliver packages
Chris,because I immediately got up to check the door and nobody was in sight
Chris,Elusive as fuck
Chris,Maybe he just ducked down
Chris,But why would he do that
Chris,It's literally his job to deliver the package
Chris,Then again
Chris,Why would he run away at mach 10

Chris,@Max
Chris,I think my endeavor for internet has finally ended
Chris,You got it working?
Chris,I have found a solution yes
Chris,Awesome
Chris,The correct solution is usually the simplest one
Chris,"I tried a few different ways of turning my phone into a hotspot without data, tethering, Bluetooth"
Chris,Tried some weird app that was supposed to work
Chris,Just wouldn't connect
Chris,So I just tried looking up how to connect my switch to the WiFi at my school
Chris,All I have to do is email some tech support desk to put my switch on a whitelist so that it can connect
Chris,Praise Reddit
Chris,so you can play smash?
Chris,"Hell yeah I can. I just need to send the email, I'm gonna do it later today"
Chris,also 4 days 
Chris,longest 4 days of my life
Chris,Yeah no kidding. I wish it wasn't exam time right now though

Chris,Ava is still doing school
Chris,90f124d8
Chris,@The Rona not allowed to buy things during December to avoid overlaps with Christmas so I've gotta wait till the 25th to either receive or buy it
Chris,Feels bad man
Chris,Yup
Chris,It'd be less annoying if I was in exams and it'd be a good excuse to nor waste studying time
Chris,But I'm working so it just kinda sucks
Chris,Should have pre-purchased  the game before December 
Chris,@Sak von Sak whatchu mean not allowed
Chris,ur an adult
Chris,with a job
Chris,I mean I could but I don't out of fear of familial ostracization
Chris,?
Chris,why
Chris,I guess me and Chris will just have an 18 day head start on you then.
Chris,Hell yeah
Chris,My Incineroar is gonna be popping off
Chris,My name is weird now
Chris,How did you do that?
Chris,Some random guy in the UWaterloo discrod had it
Chris,So I stole it
Chris,is that supposed to be a really big uwu?
Chris,I think so
Chris,lol
Chris,I'm just gonna leech off people every weekend
Chris,Come leech off of me
Chris,Actually don't
Chris,At least not until the 18th
Chris,You're kinda far
Chris,Also I generally have an advantage from having played more sm4sh
Chris,I hope to be able to catch up within a month but that might be too ambitious
Chris,Assuming the game is fun
Chris,I might just not like it
Chris,Well see
Chris,Aren't you in Toronto Zack?
Chris,Oh are you back atm? As opposed to waterloo?
Chris,After the 18th I am
Chris,Sweet
Chris,Although I have non-weekend time off until the 24th
Chris,@Sak von Sak Which characters are you interested in for Ultimate?
Chris,"Pichu, wolf, zelda, inceneroar are my main ones"
Chris,Why not pikachu?
Chris,Cause apparently pichu isn't awful
Chris,but pikachu is probably #1 in the game
Chris,The new Zelda looks kinda okay for once
Chris,"A) don't have much faith in pre release tier lists
B) when have I ever cared about how good a character is over how much fun I have with them"
Chris,She will probably be top tier
Chris,Also yeah I'm hyped for good zelda
Chris,I played some brawl recently and I still love brawl zelda
Chris,"I'm interested in Snake, Simon, Ike, Bayonetta, and Meta Knight."
Chris,So I'm excited for her not sucking
Chris,8c38e79c
Chris,wait
Chris,sm5sh is out?
Chris,Friday
Chris,Get 5mash @Trapezoider
Chris,they're calling it 5mash??? lol

Chris,I have no idea
Chris,I just did it because Andrew wrote it the other way
Chris,oh
Chris,Near the games announcement people were calling it smush
Chris,I prefer 5ma5h
Chris,"Or, if you're picky, 5mu5h"
Chris,I like Ultimate
Chris,"Pronounced ""five-muh-five-hrrrr"""

Chris,Thanks buddy
Chris,yo kids
Chris,crisis averted
Chris,purchasing 5ma5h
Chris,:pog:
Chris,What changed your mind?
Chris,well the main thing preventing me was a family rule about not buying stuff for yourself during december to avoid undercutting other people's christmas gifts
Chris,but I just kinda asked if I could anyway
Chris,you could also just
Chris,do it without asking
Chris,^
Chris,"Wow you really didn't want to see me that much, huh?"
Chris,You should get better internet for christmas
Chris,"well if I didn't ask, I run the risk of having the game, getting it as a gift, and that being both a) real awkward and b) a wasted gift"
Chris,also I literally have zero control over the terrible internet
Chris,it has to do with the line into our house
Chris,It used to not be this bad
Chris,hey guys guess what
Chris,What?
Chris,What?
Chris,UwU whats this
Chris,"Hey guys, let's kill @Mr. Airplane"
Chris,"@Mr. Airplane 
Spider GF: Catches you in her web
Spider GF: 88w88 whats this"
Chris,this man
Chris,its me
Chris,@Max how do you asdi?
Chris,I hate you
Chris,DOn't answer him
Chris,hold the cstick when in hitlag
Chris,...
Chris,You dissapoint me
Chris,?
Chris,how
Chris,do I not press it before hand
Chris,holding the cstick does not require pressing a button
Chris,no
Chris,do I hold it before the hit starts?
Chris,you can
Chris,why isnt it working then?
Chris,but if you are not in hitstun you will do a move
Chris,asdi is only 1 sdi input and usually isn't enough to make a differnece
Chris,i mean asdi down
Chris,why would you want to do that
Chris,
Chris,im holding the cstick
Chris,but i still go up
Chris,What is the situation here?
Chris,Are you edgeguarding?
Chris,this is an uncle punch challenge
Chris,what % are you at?
Chris,at really low % sometimes asdi down tech doesn't work
Chris,well it SHOULD work cause its literally built into the game
Chris,I don't really know what this even is
Chris,
Chris,(that means that it isn't important)
Chris,That isn't what I mean
Chris,I don't know the situation where you are trying to use this
Chris,i just feel like the asdi down isnt working
Chris,is ALL i need to do hold the cstick down?
Chris,I think so
Chris,You could try both sticks though
Chris,did
Chris,What % are you at
Chris,maybe asdi just like doesnt work on my controller
Chris,that is important
Chris,max
Chris,its a simulation
Chris,it should work
Chris,MODS... can... be... broken...
Chris,try taunting
Chris,this one is pretty trustworthy tho
Chris,I'm not joking
Chris,
Chris,Maybe you are not timing everything correctly
Chris,I really don't know
Chris,you should really download this modpack
Chris,i wanna see how many sdi inputs you can get on the upthrow upair sim
Chris,i usually get 1 or 2
Chris,which upon doing  r e s e a r c h
Chris,should be enough to get out of upthrow upair p consistently
Chris,but I know your good at it
Chris,Maybe I'll get it when I go on break
Chris,it seems like its prolly humanly impossible to get more than 3 inputs so I guess im doing it right
Chris,melee is sick
Chris,It is definitely possible to get at least 4
Chris,either way im pretty sure 2 is really good
Chris,https://twitter.com/unclepunch_/status/992525190063099905?lang=en
Chris,"Event #13 is ASDI-Down Tech Practice. When you taunt, Marth will be moved slightly in front of you and Up-B anywhere from 20-60 frames after you initiated the taunt. Positions are restored 2 seconds after the Up-B comes out. Thanks to @SmashG0D for the awesome suggestion! ..."

Chris,I haven't used it in months I think it's deadzo
Chris,That's a feels bad man
Chris,Keep trying though
Chris,Batteries and cables are weird
Chris,Try a different cable
Chris,dayum advanced settings are nice in ultimate

Chris,F
Chris,Im just tryna ultimate
Chris,Just leave your Switch plugged in @Trapezoider

Chris,
Chris,rip
Chris,90%
Chris,
Chris,Its happening boys
Chris,This intro song is weird
Chris,Are you kidding
Chris,That song is some fire
Chris,This bitches voice is annoying tho
Chris,D:
Chris,YO THERES VOICE ACTING IN CAMPAIGN
Chris,HYPE
Chris,Imagine doing the campaign to unlock characters
Chris,Isnt that what I have to do
Chris,nope
Chris,^
Chris,how do I get all the dudes?
Chris,"Play a game and do nothing but run and jump for 20 minutes then play games with 1 life and sd at the beginning. After every game, change the language."
Chris,this gets all characters in 2-2.5 hours
Chris,the fastest known method
Chris,Im just gonna play campaign on easy. That sounds really unfun
Chris,you will take way longer to unlock characters
Chris,See you next week when you unlock everyone
Chris,I dont need everyone
Chris,Just falcon
Chris,I think you will actually need to play story mode more than once
Chris,I think you get Falcon pretty early
Chris,Easy
Chris,I don't recommend playing the same character in multiple games
Chris,As in
Chris,Not in the story mode
Chris,Doing the method that Max described
Chris,There is a set order that you unlock the characters in doing that
Chris,Falcon plays completely different then he does in melee
Chris,This Ost is some fire
Chris,Okay I might do the thing
Chris,Story mode sux because theres ITEMS
Chris,LOL
Chris,If you insist on falcon I remember he is unlocked early
Chris,You still get to fight the characters by doing the other method
Chris,So it's not like you're just sitting there unlocking mans
Chris,You gotta beat them first
Chris,whats the first thing I gotta do
Chris,Run/ jump around for 20 minutes in a match
Chris,don't fight just move
Chris,plug in 2 controllers so the cpu doesn't attack you
Chris,set the rules to time 20 minutes
Chris,I dont have a second controller rn. Can I just not attack and try to live for 20 mins?
Chris,If I take dmg is it over?
Chris,You realise that a joy con is a controller
Chris,you can take damage
Chris,it is just annoying
Chris,Are you using a gamecube controller Andrew?
Chris,yes
Chris,Then use your joycons as a second controller
Chris,ez clapper
Chris,Already started the time
Chris,Not worth easy
Chris,wavelanding kinda sucks
Chris,max
Chris,I accidentally used the thing from kirby
Chris,I didnt damage the cpu
Chris,do i need to start over?

Chris,What do you mean you used the thing from kirby?
Chris,the three piece ship
Chris,I accidentally picked up all 3 and activated it
Chris,no dmg though
Chris,there is no need to start over
Chris,All you are doing is increasing an invisible steps taken and times jumped counter
Chris,As long as you continue to do those things everything is fine
Chris,"so just keep jumping
?"
Chris,literally it's totally fine
Chris,What do I do after game one
Chris,just move around and jump
Chris,just run and jump for 20 minutes
Chris,after the time runs out you will get to unlock ness
Chris,"then play 1-stock games and as soon as you get a character, fight em then change the game language and then play more 1-stock games until you get everyone"
Chris,then change the language and change the rules to 1 stock
Chris,in system settings or game settings?
Chris,game settings
Chris,do I kill the ai during sudden death or let myself die?
Chris,@Ultimate
Chris,Doesn't matter
Chris,so now just change language after every stock
Chris,Dope
Chris,Yup
Chris,can i just go back and forth on languages?
Chris,Yes
Chris,dope
Chris,can I interupt this process to play online
Chris,I have no idea
Chris,Or do I have to do the move thing again to start unlocking through language switcthing
Chris,just suck it up and play mad one stock games
Chris,It probably doesn't matter
Chris,I wanna play you before I have to go chris
Chris,Sauce up

Chris,@Mr. Airplane unblock me
Chris,Nope
Chris,Yes
Chris,nope
Chris,One final down three to go
Chris,Looks like I'm changing mains in ultimate
Chris,Why?
Chris,Corrin's moves can't hit short characters
Chris,they go right over their head
Chris,I'm going to be a Shulk player now
Chris,does shulk not suck ass in ultimate?
Chris,pog
Chris,I've seen people placing him high on tier lists
Chris,no im not saying you're wrong
Chris,im just like
Chris,pog
Chris,Max most of corrins best moves hit short stuff
Chris,Down tilt
Chris,Pin
Chris,Nair
Chris,Bite
Chris,Shulk just does all the things I liked about Corrin better
Chris,That wasn't the only reason for switching
Chris,"But just so you know I meant that it was hard to kill short characters because fsmash and bair, which seem to be the two moves that kill the earliest, either don't hit short characters or are hard to land."
Chris,Young link is still gay confirmed
Chris,He can't be gay though
Chris,He wears pink
Chris,and gay men don't wear pink
Chris,the math checks out
Chris,the numbers dont lie
Chris,@Ultimate Anyone down to play?
Chris,10 mins then yes
Chris,just join up when ready
Chris,hot damn kingston sm4sh put out a PR for the game's entire lifespan and I juuuuust barely slid in
Chris,"and it's really funny for me looking at everyone above me and being like ""yup, yup, yup, better than me, yup, yup"" for everyone ranked above me... except andybulb"
Chris,which I'm basing entirely off the one time I fought him and booped him with captain falcon after not going to tournaments for like a year
Chris,I'm sure he's probably done really well around that but oh well
Chris,I'm still pretty happy I made it on this despite barely only really playing for like a year
Chris,of the like four-ish years that there was a scene
Chris,How did a Little Mac get so high
Chris,Isn't Little Mac like really bad
Chris,we had the best little mac in ontario
Chris,second best in canada
Chris,he 2-0'd the guy who was (at the time) #3 in ontario a few times
Chris,"dude the whole PR up until #7 is low tier with the exception of DK who's like, mid tier"
Chris,"the character spread is like
mid, low, low, low, low, low, very high, high, high, top, high, mid/high, low, mid, mid/low, top, top, low, low, low"
Chris,we were a weird city
Chris,is kingston just all zacks?
Chris,@Ultimate

Chris,but I thought he returned the game
Chris,You guys can spectate the match

Chris,lol
Chris,oh yeah spectating is a thing in this game
Chris,Also I want to play y'all at some point
Chris,HELL YEAH BOIS

""You thought it was an email from your coworker, but it was hooded hackerman""
and a graphic of some random dude in a shirt and tie would peel back and this dude would be behind it"
Chris,I mostly just get a kick out of the idea of a generic hacker as a dude in a black hoodie with bright red sunglasses

Chris,jesus dude
Chris,  OVERWATCH IS FUN
Chris,Overwatch is fun ❗
Chris,i think people who dont like it are just focussed too much on the wrong aspects of the game
Chris,that's subjective
Chris,i mean
Chris,not really
Chris,It completely is
Chris,that's actually the truest thing you could say about anything
Chris,if you dont like ow youre just a fat gay idiot
Chris,i mean you could go a moba and i could say well you don't enjoy it
Chris,because your focusing on the wrong aspects
Chris,i mean sure
Chris,but thats
Chris,pretty retarded to say
Chris,yeah maybe the fun aspects arent what you're interested in
Chris,so you just dont like the game
Chris,fusion like feeding

Chris,dva enables so much more interesting comps and playstyles
Chris,we just need more dva-like characters
Chris,"pharah, bastion, orisa, junkrat would all be broken if dva was banned, and these aren't fun or interesting characters to play when left unchecked"

Chris,Masteranime - Watch Anime Online Free
Chris,Masteranime - is an anime info database with a streaming option to watch anime in HD. Join the community to keep track of your watched anime and get to follow friends to see what they're watching.
Chris,Ooh thats a big spicy
Chris,Thank
Chris,"pretty much all of the anime streaming sites suck these days. They're all slow, low quality, and full of ads. You gotta torrent them yourself if you want quality."
Chris,I caNT ANYMORE
Chris,BECAUSE I USED TO PIRATE ALL THE TIME and now my ISP will rape me if I pirate again
Chris,
Chris,BIG sad
Chris,LOL
Chris,It was so dumb
Chris,I haven't had any issues with anime torrenting
Chris,I pirated BOTW to emulate
Chris,but that didnt matter because my MAJORAS MASK ROM was the final strike
Chris,lol stupid
Chris,How much do you have to pirate to get warned by your ISP?
Chris,but if anyone is curious the current anime torrent site I know of that works well is nyaa.si

Chris,https://clips.twitch.tv/ApatheticVenomousShieldPraiseIt
Chris,FRAN Playing Overwatch - Twitch Clips
Chris,Jeff Kaplan destroys players below Diamond - Clipped by akbierly
Chris,I really think that this argument is just false
Chris,metas in ow apply to basically every skill tier above like silver
Chris,like yeah other things can work in lower tiers
Chris,but if people just randomly decided to run goats they would still probably win
Chris,metas do not only rely on executing specific strategies but also the natural synergy between characters and the inherent strengths of characters
Chris,like dva is just really really good so you are more likely to win with a dva than without at basically every elo
Chris,yet the entire ow community seems to agree with Jeff here and uses this to argue about game balance like what
Chris,yea i can probably agree with you was Jeff just saying this relating to something else or what? @Mr. Airplane
Chris,he basically just said meta doesnt matter at plat and below
Chris,and then on reddit people were like 'yeah meta doesnt even really matter unless you're in like the top 5% of players'
Chris,Yeah that's retarded
Chris,"hmm i mean i think your both probably right but think it's more like gold and to a greater degree silver and below, because at that rank people just don't have any fundamentals so they rarely can make use of playing the character or the comp to their maximum potential. I do admit if a team were to play goats they would be more effective than just picking random hero's due to the innate usefulness of goats. Metas do apply but not because the players are good or can make use of the meta comp but more just due to the comp it self just being better than what they would pick normally that's probably my perspective"
Chris,bruh i literally just said that
Chris,read my wall of text
Chris,ok
Chris,smile
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,What's goats

Chris,I just wanna know who the egg is
Chris,
Chris,daily vlogs    daily vlogs

Chris,daily vlogs    daily vlogs  
Chris,oops
Chris,????????????????
Chris,Dude what is going on
Chris,daily vlogs    daily vlogs  
Chris,
Chris,Yes
Chris,"What it mean when ya girl say """""
Chris,Oh
Chris,"kingston melee PR's out for this season, I can say with confidence I would have been on this if I was in kingston, based on the handul of tourneys I went to"
Chris,Where would you place yourself?
Chris,"I haven't played some of these people, but I'm say at least in the 7-9 range, possibly 6"
Chris,Also where would you place me?
Chris,Your region seems to lack good fox players.
Chris,"for the people I have played: 0-3 with dayman, 2-3 with momba, 0-1 with boo, 1-1 with deep in thot, 3-0 with sasquatch, 0-2 with dog, 1-0 with whom"
Chris,"I don't know honestly, I haven't gotten to play people all that much this season"
Chris,or you cause our connection's pretty bad
Chris,When you say 0-1 or 2-3 is that set count or game count?
Chris,sets
Chris,Are you going to bed soon or do you want to try some ultimate tonight?
Chris,D&D till bed
Chris,"but also I'm going to bed early no matter what, I'm starting to get a little sick so I want to make sure I get a good night's sleep"
Chris,"also, if it was in games, how would I be 0-1 or 1-0 or 1-1?"
Chris,Friendlies or a forfeit.
Chris,I guess forfeit could make sense
Chris,but I wouldn't count friendlies
Chris,I remember you saying something once about a guy reporting a score as 0 - -1
Chris,
Chris,Gottem
Chris,Nice job
Chris,Now I just gotta beat ceroas
Chris,fuck him up
Chris,We should do an Ultimate tourney when Kameron gets the game
Chris,Yes
Chris,@Ultimate
Chris,Probably with a character ban system like with melee
Chris,Also @Trapezoider don't be big gay
Chris,
Chris,Oh yeah he also has the game
Chris,Tournaments for this game will be cooler then our previous ones because we can host an arena for it and all the sets can be watched by the other players.
Chris,Im selling my switch mang
Chris,sorry
Chris,
Chris,unless zelda 2 gets announced
Chris,Just give it to Jed so he can play
Chris,
Chris,Or don't be big gay
Chris,I can imagine you selling your switch and then the very next day they announce the new Zelda game
Chris,YO 4TH
Chris,yeet
Chris,THATS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BUT DESERVED
Chris,@Trapezoider Don't sell yet
Chris,^
Chris,you gotta play more fam
Chris,mmm I was expecting like 5th
Chris,and had hopes of 4th
Chris,you thought maybe they would put you below jarek
Chris,yeah but that was fake I guess
Chris,I wasn't going off stats on that i was just worried he'd be biased in the decision time
Chris,but he wasn't
Chris,noice
Chris,yo I just did my math placement test and tested into math 250/260 thats good right?
Chris,what is math 250/260
Chris,cause its gonna depend based on the school
Chris,like what is the name
Chris,College algebra and trigonometry I guess?
Chris,Generally 2xx courses are second year so that's probably good
Chris,111 is college algebra at chemeketa
Chris,"It's GCU though, I imagine they have a different naming scheme? Unless you are secretly a GOD at math :D"
Chris,If it's the same as chemeketa that's calculus
Chris,And stats
Chris,I think they usually have similar naming systems
Chris,I thought so too but then I compared my community college to the state college I'm transferring to and everything was WACK
Chris,They literally had a whole website for translating which courses were equivelant between the schools
Chris,True
Chris,Maybe I lied
Chris,Idk the projected math course for me was 154 but the test said 250
Chris,Go on their website and find out which math that is
Chris,I'm curious
Chris,^
Chris,You might be a math God?
Chris,"Also Chris, thanks for help on math last year buddy. I used to hate it but now that I'm getting into the higher level stuff I'm really enjoying math!!!"
Chris,Applications of college algebra

Chris,@Mr. Airplane
Chris,We can't help you unless we see
Chris,"@Mr. Airplane I wouldn't grow your hair so long that people would say that you have ""long hair"" but less short then I remember you having would be fine."

Chris,@Max what's ur gsp
Chris,"I have no idea, it changes as the relative gsp of everyone else changes. So since I have not played in a few days it is probably different from what it was before by hundreds of thousands. I am in elite smash though, so if you are not at least that you aren't caught up yet."
Chris,im just wondering
Chris,^
Chris,I'll go check in a few minutes

Chris,that was an absolute shitshow
Chris,Rip
Chris,0-2?
Chris,yeah
Chris,against some garbage players
Chris,at least I've still got melee tomorrow
Chris,I really want to try ultimate competitively but I can't justify buying a switch
Chris,Just yoink Andrew's
Chris,He is selling it though
Chris,Exactly
Chris,So just yoink it
Chris,
Chris,andrew's selling his switch??
Chris,"Yeah, he's big gay"
Chris,wow what a retard
Chris,260 for 3 games and switch so issa good deal
Chris,And I did just get a $250 bonus but like I have school to pay for soon
Chris,buy it and resell the non ultimate games
Chris,Good idea
Chris,They are all digital though
Chris,oh
Chris,Yeah
Chris,Rip
Chris,Ok I don't know if this is good advice so take it with a grain of salt
Chris,Yeah you got school to pay for
Chris,But you also gotta treat yo self sometimes you feel
Chris,Yeah
Chris,Plus you got your entire school period to make money to pay for it
Chris,This is also true
Chris,"And in reality if everything works out the way I have planned I'll only actually be owing 3,000 out of pocket"
Chris,That ain't too too bad
Chris,Fingers crossed I can transfer to the Chipotle newar my school so I can get the reimbursement for the rest
Chris,Yeah it's hella good
Chris,Just don't come to me if this turns out to be a bad financial decision
Chris,
Chris,Also don't you have to pay for online monthly though?
Chris,Yeah but it's only $20 a year
Chris,Oh
Chris,We might also start a frostbite family plan
Chris,Plus if you do a family plan with the peeps in here it becomes a lot less
Chris,Ay nice
Chris,For example I'm only paying $8
Chris,@Ultimate Anyone?
Chris,No
Chris,Botw and Mario are physical
Chris,Oh shit

Chris,since his defensive game isnt that strong
Chris,he has to approach
Chris,"Well I did pretty bad in pools, but at least there's an amateur bracket"
Chris,On the flip side I won the rock paper scissors tournament

Chris,@Homies
Chris,anyone taken linera algebra?
Chris,Me
Chris,Okay
Chris,Vector Quantization
Chris,Im trying to collapse a series of audio channels into a single 1 dimension vector. My research keeps pointing me to a method called vector quantization
Chris,I have the basics of what a vector is from this video
Chris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs
Chris,"Vectors, what even are they? | Essence of linear algebra, chapter 1"
Chris,"I imagine many viewers are already familiar with vectors in some context, so this video is intended both as a quick review of vector terminology, as well as ..."
Chris,but as soon as things get funky i get CONFUSED
Chris,You got any insight?
Chris,When do things get funkyÉ
Chris,?
Chris,Also I'm not sure I know what vector quantization is
Chris,So my author talks about vector quantization then Markov Chains?
Chris,Are these linear algebra things even???
Chris,URRRGg
Chris,❤
Chris,"If it has to do with vectors, yes"
Chris,
Chris,Markov chain sounds like it's just a way of seeing sequences of possible events
Chris,Vector quantization is definitly a linear algebra concept
Chris,@Mr. Airplane Might know more?
Chris,Bird boi!!!
Chris,Come hither
Chris,I have scooby snacks 
Chris,Hmm
Chris,A quick Google search reveals that vector quantization is also a statistics concept
Chris,For creating a probability density function
Chris,Well that explains why im confused
Chris,I know nothing about probability density functions
Chris,Im only in my first stats class this term
Chris,You're definitly going to learn about them there
Chris,Probably more towards the end though
Chris,We just covered measures of variance / the normal distribution
Chris,True
Chris,Do probability density functions get pretty difficult
Chris,because so far the class is easy
Chris,Not really
Chris,Cool
Chris,
Chris,Math is so cool
Chris,Agreed
Chris,markov chains is indeed linear algebra
Chris,but i learned that like half a year ago i dont remember any of it lol

Chris,it just felt super generic and the second half was basically like 6 episodes of story and a fuckton of padding
Chris,Really :0
Chris,yeah
Chris,it's my very own Unpopular Anime Opinion
Chris,(TM)
Chris,Certainly
Chris,I actually agree with Zack
Chris,
Chris,The last 20 episodes are a lot of ACTION
Chris,But I still adore the show
Chris,I love the soundtrack
Chris,I've learned most of it on piano
Chris,"action can rarely hold something up on its own, and FMA has pretty uninspired choreography"
Chris,and there's just so much random stuff that felt like they threw it in without having much of a reason beyond padding the episode count
Chris,Except for this fight scene... I think even you can agree this is top notch

Chris,Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Alphonse vs. Pride and Kimblee
Chris,Alphonse is a total badass! Subscribe to our channel for all the latest updates & videos! Website: http://www.animelab.com Like us on Facebook: http://www.fa...
Chris,yeah that was a decent fight
Chris,but for a show with as much fighting as there was nothing particularly standout
Chris,like you look at most decent shows with a lot of fights and there'll always be at least a few crazy awesome fights and FMA just kinda doesn't
Chris,"you look at like, 
Fate/ - saber vs lancer, kiritsugu vs kirei, shirou vs archer, etc etc etc
KLK - every ryuko vs satsuki fight but especially the first, the second proper ryuko vs nui fight, the episode and a half boat fight, etc etc etc
MHA: All might vs nomu, deku vs todoroki, etc etc etc"
Chris,even some shows with basically zero fighting have really damn good fights every now and then
Chris,see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2QkKGrTd6Y
Chris,Tohru vs Kanna
Chris,Anime: Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon

Chris,"I love how twitch chat is memeing ""take this"""
Chris,?
Chris,Richter goes TAKE THIS when he brings out the jesus water
Chris,ah I see
Chris,Why would you play Richter over Simon?
Chris,there's a few matchups where it's better cause of some weird property of the jesus water
Chris,that is the literal only difference between the two
Chris,Yeah but isn't the difference Simon's holy water has the fire property and Richter's doesn't
Chris,I don't really know how it works honestly
Chris,I think it's better to have one in some matchups? not sure
Chris,Why would you not want to have the fire property
Chris,or it might be that it only matters in some matchups
Chris,"cause it's all the same hitboxes, they both do the thing where you're eating a whole bunch of hits if you're in it"
Chris,it's just literally the type of damage
Chris,which has some weird niche effects
Chris,ARMADA VS APOLOGY MAN
Chris,BATTLE OF THE TITANS
Chris,thats a pog dude
Chris,Qucik question

Chris,slap's actually pretty fun
Chris,yeah

Chris,man's like top 2 fish in canada

Chris,"there's a solid sm4sh set going on right now (zackray, the guy who's been dominating japan) vs sonix (hella wifi warrior), and it's a great set but I'm really upset that both commentators are saying 'utilize' instead of 'use'"

Chris,the smash elo system is dumb
Chris,why do i gain more for beating somebody way lower rank than me than when i lose to somebody slightly higher rank
Chris,If you're low elo you gain hella fast
Chris,They want to separate the crappy players
Chris,I've got the opposite atm
Chris,I gain like nothing and lose a lot of I lose
Chris,maybe its cause im playing a new character
Chris,"For the first few matches of a new character, elo gains and losses are significantly increased."
Chris,"Legit I was playing yesterday, went like 7-3 with my only losses to people with higher elo and at least 4 wins over people with higher elo, and went from 3.680 million to 3.682"

Chris,My prediction is no more than 4 of the usual 15
Chris,I think I'm gonna work from home today
Chris,As I'm sitting here on a perfectly nice day getting ready for school. Sigh
Chris,I would rather have your weather - I left my laptop charger at work so I'm gonna have to go out today to buy one
Chris,In the cold and rain and ice and hail
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,you can work from home?
Chris,Thats legit
Chris,ATI wont give remote access under any circumstances
Chris,Do you just RDP back to your desktop or does your laptop have all your projects?
Chris,"Laptop has all my stuff, and I can connect to everything else remotely"
Chris,Feels fucking bad. I still have classes
Chris,
Chris,"Slogged my way to school. Freezing half dead and ready to give in. Next thing you know, i see other people at home playing apex while they have no class"
Chris,feelsbadman
Chris,@Zain
Chris,A classic
Chris,"Pffft I'm in a video meeting atm to discuss how our depart did in the last quarter, and at one point they go ""the number of people using our services have skyrocketed! This is mostly because we broadened the definition of what qualifies as an active user, but it sure does make our numbers look good"""
Chris,LOLOL
Chris,Thats brilliant
Chris,I love corporate bullshitery like that
Chris,"In all fairness, even with our old metrics we did well, but also our new metrics made us look even better"
Chris,"@Master Memers boys chris raw just pronouced Yosemite ""Yah-Meh-Set"""
Chris,Chris wtf

Chris,
Chris,I know it's pronounced weird but that's just awful
Chris,"""Yo-ze-mite"""
Chris,"my life in japanese is ""yamen-nasai"""
Chris,
Chris,apex legends is a pretty fun battle royal
Chris,"Okay, I just watched a video on this game and it looks like a lot of fun"
Chris,I'll have to see how the shooting mechanics work though to know if I can enjoy it for more then a few days
Chris,@TheRainbowpixelz How does the game make money?
Chris,Do you start with all characters or do you have to buy them?
Chris,All but 2 characters are unlocked
Chris,All legends are sorta balanced.
Chris,I'd yet because  I've only played it for less than an hour
Chris,Ttk is mid to high. Guns feel super satisfying  to shoot
Chris,Game makes money by cosmetic  microtransactions. Since the game is ftp it gets a half pass
Chris,If all it sells are cosmetics that is amazing to me
Chris,As long as it aint loot boxes
Chris,Fingers crossed that ea doesn't pull an activision
Chris,It is loot boxes
Chris,As long as the majority of the gameplay content is not locked behind a paywall I'm game
Chris,smh
Chris,I do not care even a little how my character looks so I don't care how they do the cosmetics
Chris,^
Chris,I just want good and accessible gameplay
Chris,Have you played Titan fall?
Chris,no
Chris,OK then don't worry. The movement feels as crisp as cod
Chris,Never played cod either

Chris,Who does parties of 3
Chris,It runs on a modified source engine
Chris,yo

Chris,On low
Chris,I'm more worried about it functioning at all

Chris,no one cares about your annoying little crew
Chris,"fuck off ava you don't do shit in here, we kick the people after we are done playing with them unless they're chill and we want to keep playing games with them"
Chris,which I believe is the point of this server
Chris,I actually do talk in here semi-frequently thank you very much
Chris,and why even invite people if you literally plan to kick them
Chris,just make a group DM?? duh
Chris,"Damn just calm down boys and girls it's all good where just here to have some fun in the end, no need to start shit if you guys have some complaints just talk to me in DM instead of starting a flame war in chillin or don't do whatever you want lol."

Chris,Yee
Chris,But later tho
Chris,I am ready to refine my new main
Chris,I got family over
Chris,Who is your new main?
Chris,Young Link
Chris,Why?
Chris,"Because while I really like Cloud and saw great results with him against  people worse then me, you need to hit most of your limits with him in order to beat people that are as good as or better then you. Limit is not something you can really combo into, so it requires a read to hit. Getting reads like that has always been something that I've been bad at compared to everything else. Young Link does not require reads in the same way to do well and also has a really awesome combo game, good projectiles, and a better recovery."
Chris,@Ultimate Lets do a tournament this weekend
Chris,ok i am here

Chris,@Mr. Airplane
Chris,"Its kind of unfortunate that the one part of our body that must always be kept exposed, our eyes, is so close to the one part of our bodies that must absolutely be protected, our brain."
Chris,it makes it harder to damage something that would cause us to lose some or all of our vision
Chris,cause there's fewer connecting parts that could be damaged
Chris,also faster reaction times
Chris,@Mr. Airplane  :-(
Chris,Did not think of the first one but I have considered the second point. I'm just not sure how much faster it would be.
Chris,"not much, which was why I brought it up as more of an afterthought"
Chris,but generally most of our sensory stuff is on our heads so it might be some of that
Chris,I dunno honestly
Chris,I'm guessing more of my original first point
Chris,@Jed
Chris,Brb
Chris,A lot of sensory stuff is also in the spinal cord
Chris,Most reflexes that we do come from it
Chris,@Jed
Chris,You here???
Chris,Can hear?
Chris,Also I do think that the speed is important enough
Chris,the spinal stuff is mostly for body senses something -> body reacts without mental processing stuff
Chris,Correct
Chris,so I guess that could work
Chris,as a counterpoint
Chris,hm
Chris,The brain still gets information though
Chris,just later yeah
Chris,Just to let it know what it's doing
Chris,For posture and stuff
Chris,so I think I'm gonna stick with the protecting the connecting bits theory
Chris,I could agree with that

Chris,She's a Genius!
Chris,oh ew
Chris,that's lame
Chris,whoever wrote that is stupid
Chris,
Chris,sorry @Trapezoider @Jed i ended up having a long winded discussion with my friends about killing babies
Chris,Abortion?
Chris,I hope
Chris,no
Chris,killing living babies
Chris,You mean that New York law?
Chris,no
Chris,just in general
Chris,wait what did new york do
Chris,You can kill a newborn through neglect and it will be legally considered abortion
Chris,that's... not a good law
Chris,that's a pretty terrible law
Chris,Wait what the fuck
Chris,That is horrible
Chris,Who
Chris,The fuck
Chris,Thanks for at least being reasonable on this
Chris,aren't you not even allowed abortions past a certain point in the pregnancy
Chris,Voted for that
Chris,because it starts getting enough brain to be at least somewhat conscious
Chris,Different states can decide the point at which abortion is allowed
Chris,how in the fuck
Chris,"is a completely born, living baby"
Chris,What argument could there possibly be for this law???
Chris,not considered alive enough that that's a motherfucking problem
Chris,I have no idea how this passed
Chris,This is actually rediculous. Do you have a source for this?
Chris,let me find one real quick
Chris,Thanks crazy extremist left
Chris,nah our argument was more like theoretical
Chris,
Chris,Perhaps some of the things I heard were exaggerations but an abortion when there should be a delivery is still pretty sad
Chris,Not ruling out what I said as impossible though
Chris,Yeah q
Chris,based on that's it's just legal until birth
Chris,Still crazy either way
Chris,which is still a little sketchy
Chris,but not anywhere near as crazy
Chris,I think the after birth thing was a law currently being debated in Virginia based on what I read
Chris,I think that's actually discusting still
Chris,yeah
Chris,but in comparison it's not as bad
Chris,They are pretty equal
Chris,depends on the timeframe of letting neglect kill your baby counting as an abortion
Chris,It could be only seconds separating the time of death
Chris,"Even if you don't want it, just put it up for adoption"
Chris,"neglect would normally be like not feeding it, so I don't think it'd be seconds"
Chris,I'm pretty sure the neglect thing real or not was to be done only right after birth
Chris,seconds would be the doctor fucking up
Chris,"but yeah, still quite fucked up"
Chris,If you don't make a baby breath it can suffocate in seconds
Chris,I know someone who is mentally disabled because the doctor couldn't make him breath soon enough
Chris,"wouldn't have thought of that as neglect, but I dunno how the law looks at it"
Chris,I was thinking neglect being parental
Chris,anything else is just the doctor not being fast/good enough
Chris,"you do understand nobody carries the baby up to full term and then decides at the last second, the law is put in place for babies that will die soon after birth due to debilitating complications"
Chris,still a weird way of handling it
Chris,idk i think its perfectly fine
Chris,in the end its the parents choice
Chris,I guess the choice of the child doesn't matter then
Chris,"well i mean the ""child"" isnt actually like  a person yet"
Chris,so
Chris,they dont have one?
Chris,It's still a living breathing human being
Chris,Not everyone sees personhood as starting at the same time
Chris,it's not like they can make a choice at that point in life
Chris,i mean its not like you're offing a person who has lived a life and had experiences
Chris,and it's basically assisted suicide
Chris,which is a totally different argument
Chris,that kind of makes it worse
Chris,its like im deteling a game save that didnt have an data on it not like im deleteing a 100% completion run
Chris,You are denying them the choice
Chris,that I don't feel like having right now cause I'm real tired and should probably get to sleep and also I don't know my own stance on it
Chris,Would it be sadder to see a 5 year old die who has had no chance at life or a 100 year old with a life fully lived
Chris,"it's basically: yes you're denying them the choice, but also you're making the choice to doom them to a short life of misery"
Chris,both of which are shitty options
Chris,"regardless, I'm going to sleep"
Chris,goodnight
Chris,i mean both are about the same if you ask me?
Chris,i mena people die
Chris,shit ahppens
Chris,Yeah but not always purposefully
Chris,That's like saying it's alright if I murder my neighbour so who cares?
Chris,well an unborn baby =/= your neighbour
Chris,your neighbours is like actually a person
Chris,"""people die all the time"""
Chris,max said 5 year old vs 100 year old
Chris,idk where that argument was going but i was answering it
Chris,look i dont wanna argue about it cause nobody is gonna change their opinion about anything and itll just end in people being grumpy so ima drop it
Chris,I mean we don't really get grumpy from political debates here but I understand why you don't wanna argue
Chris,i cant tell tone is this like an offhanded roast or a genuine comment
Chris,Genuine comment
Chris,I don't know if everyone already knows or not but plup got into summit
Chris,You are denying those people the opportunity to exist
Chris,There is the potential for a life full of wonderful conscious experiences
Chris,@Sak von Sak
Chris,@SWIRL GIRL
Chris,pls join
Chris,
Chris,I'm
Chris,At work
Chris,O
Chris,Kay
Chris,@SWIRL GIRL come play big gai
Chris,In like 10 minutes
Chris,Jk more like 25
Chris,Fuck you
Chris,
Chris,jk tho
Chris,
Chris,since no one knows what time human becomes a human it's safest to assume that they are a human at conception so you can't abort anything if you could determine at what time a person becomes a person you wouldn't have this argument when we have something as valuable as life on the line i would rather be safe then sorry that's my position. @Max @Sak von Sak @Eric Working From Home @The Rona
Chris,I think abortion should be legal up to 2500 weeks
Chris,Yo that's 48 years
Chris,Yes
Chris,exactly
Chris,Also I agree with Zain
Chris,But in all seriousness I agree with Zain as well
Chris,"Considering that your brain is pretty much one of the first things that begins development, I would argue you ""become a person"" pretty early on"
Chris,i mean even if you are arguing that it is a person and not an anomaly (im probably using that word wrong) the value of a life isnt that high imo
Chris,"An anomaly would be something that isn't standard, so I don't really know what you mean by that?"
Chris,A fetus is a pretty normal thing
Chris,uhh
Chris,hello boss?
Chris,considering a zygote contains all the information necessary for a complete human to form I think that is when you are human
Chris,If there was a completely painless and cost free way to remove a zygote from the womb and grow it externally without harming the mother I think there becomes no moral arguement for abortion
Chris,change my mind
Chris,@SWIRL GIRL
Chris,@Bitmin
Chris,are you guys still here?
Chris,I got yoted?
Chris,i mean what would even be the point of going to those lengths to create a person
Chris,That's what plan B does right?
Chris,Because it is better to live than to never have the chance to exist
Chris,there are so many people in the world and we are so insignificant that to think we actually matter is narcissistic and delusional
Chris,And creating more concious minds is the moral imperative
Chris,like if i died tomorrow would it matter
Chris,no
Chris,Yes it would
Chris,Because you matter
Chris,i care about u dober
Chris,thats the poiont in tryna make
Chris,nobody matters
Chris,u matter to me
Chris,But that's not true
Chris,^
Chris,Thats not true
Chris,Every life matters. Conciousness is the only thing that matters. Maybe the universe doesnt assign us any meaning at birth
Chris,"If you have the mindset that you don't matter, then you probably won't ever do anything that matters. But if you live your life with the mindset of doing something that matters and had an impact somewhere, you probably will achieve that to some scale"
Chris,But it could be said that humans and more generally conscious creatures are the ONLY thing that matters
Chris,"i'm all for killing babies, but i don't like letting women have a choice"
Chris,^^
Chris,^^^
Chris,Pinned a message.
Chris,so in DnD spiders have a strength of 2
Chris,meaning they can life 30 pounds (reduced to 15 due to their size)
Chris,a single spider can carry 15 pounds
Chris,imagine you wake up in the night and see a spiuder yoinking your newborn
Chris,Crawls into your womb and just carries them out
Chris,you have made me feel a feeling i never want to feel again
Chris,Good
Chris,the argument of a single person mattering or not mattering isn't even related to abortion

Chris,owl
Chris,"on friday, we had an office lunch thing where our manager took us all out for lunch, I ended up sitting next to the manager and one of the full timers and got to listen to them spend the entire lunch talking about weed"
Chris,Is weed legal where you live?
Chris,yeah
Chris,its legal in all of canada
Chris,it's legal canada-wide
Chris,but you need a license to sell it and only a tiiiiiiny handful of places have gotten some yet
Chris,so most available weed is still illegal
Chris,well illegal to sell not illegal to be in possesion of right?
Chris,yeah
Chris,you can also grow your own
Chris,how many plants?
Chris,but only up to a maximum of like 4 plants or something
Chris,I think in Oregon its 5
Chris,Why would there be a plant restriction?
Chris,my family almost ended up growing weed for one of my mum's friends who is basically incapable of not killing houseplants
Chris,"it's basically to make it so you can't grow and sell easily, you have enough for a household who are all using but not really enough to sell it"
Chris,or at least I think that's why
Chris,plant restriction so the entire population of canada doesnt get addicted
Chris,but 5 plants if a fuck ton lmao
Chris,weed's not addictive tho
Chris,^
Chris,i know but
Chris,How big is a weed plant?
Chris,sketchy dealers will sometimes lace it with addictive stuff but if you grow your own it's just weed
Chris,"I honestly have no idea, but I think they grow pretty low to the ground so I'd assume not big"
Chris,"they're closer to, y'know, weeds than regular plants"
Chris,i thought the idea is that individuals mass growing weed doesnt screw with the price
Chris,that makes more sense honestly
Chris,I mean oregon has too much weed now lmao
Chris,oregon has to grow it for the other states 
Chris,You are allowed to plants per person over 18 in a household
Chris,oh damn not bad
Chris,we might have been growing 6-8 plants then
Chris,Oh the age is probably 18 to smoke there huh?
Chris,"I would have thought 19, same as drinking age, but I dunno"
Chris,Eief way still better than 21
Chris,You can't even vape or smoke tobacco products till 21 in Oregon now

I've been sleeping with no clothes on for the passed few nights because it feels better and my grandpa doesn't come into my room much, so he wouldn't know. But this morning I accidentally slept in so grandpa came in to wake me up. I had morning wood (an erection in the morning that is caused in your sleep) and I had kicked the covers off during the night so I was laying there naked, with a hard-on (how embaressing!!). Grandpa quickly went out of the room and we weren't talking because it was awkward. Then later on today I was wanking off in the bathroom (which doesn't have a lock) when I thought my grandpa was outside. He walked in just as I was ejaculating and groaning with . One day doesn't get much more embaressing than that!! How unlucky. My grandpa and I haven't talked for seven hours now. What should I say to him?"

Chris,pfft nice

Chris,TAHNK YOU
Chris,I kinda like the water one tho
Chris,Nobody here likes my boy Grookey 
Chris,water and fire are aight but grookey is so bad it drags htem down with it
Chris,he's second best but not really particularly notable
Chris,fingers crossed for kameron liking the fire one and then if we do gen 8 we all get the starter we want
Chris,He's literally a baby monkey
Chris,So cute
Chris,I the the fire one too

Chris,Report: Amazon will pay $0 in federal taxes this year
Chris,"Amazon won't pay a cent in federal taxes this year, according to a report by a watchdog group.  The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy(ITEP) reports that Amazon, in fact, is getting a $129 million rebate, meaning they will effectively pay a negative one percent tax rate."
Chris,Yikes
Chris,Big business privilege
Chris,Have not read a ton on this but I think they helped write the tax laws that made this possible
Chris,Why do we let this happen
Chris,Cause we don't want them moving to a different country and losing jobs
Chris,But it's still really not a good way to go about it
Chris,i mean it's free speech dude the speech that says heres 10 million dollars lets write some laws deff not a bribe btw
Chris,lol

Chris,@Homies @Eric Working From Home Just found out that tabletop simulator has a bunch of full magic the gathering sets on the workshop and I want to play the game again. Feel free to @ me if anyone wants to play.
Chris,That'd be fun we could play like with the battledecks or have a draft/commander night
Chris,im not huge on draft tho
Chris,not a fan of commander but I would be down for draft or sealed
Chris,haha
Chris,oh lol
Chris,We could do 6 packs from an old set
Chris,if people play draft ill play dont get me wrong
Chris,prerelease style
Chris,ah okay
Chris,never been to a prerelease
Chris,they are fun
Chris,I went to the magic origins one
Chris,i liked that set
Chris,I think that this format would be best because I doubt we will get enough for draft.
Chris,Prerelease format works with any player count
Chris,fair
Chris,We could pick an old classic set like Innistrad or Zendikar
Chris,innistrad best plane with best planeswalker as its guardian dont @ me
Chris,My favorite set personally was Khans of Tarkir

Chris,Will you have mega free time tomorrow?
Chris,I'll have a computer then hopefully
Chris,yes
Chris,Not sure if you are interested but I would be super down to play some Magic the gathering on tabletop
Chris,Any amount would work for sealed but we need at least 6 for a proper draft
Chris,I don't think playing a constructed format would be a good idea
Chris,The way magic works on tabletop would make it complicated and inconvenient
Chris,@Zain Do you know how to play magic or would you be learning?
Chris,I would play sealed or draft
Chris,@deleted-role anyone down?
Chris,"@Homies We are playing magic the gathering on tabletop simulator tomorrow. Feel free to come and join whether you have played before or are new to the game as anyone who has played can teach you before we start. For those who know what this means, we will be playing either sealed or draft as constructed is inconvenient to play on tabletop."
Chris,why dont we just play rn
Chris,I guess I could try on my laptop
Chris,he has his laptop
Chris,tabletop sim is not too resource intensive
Chris,which is better than his pc anyways

Chris,@Mr. Airplane of course you wanna play rivals now that I'm not at home
Chris,I could play keyboard kragg on shitty wifi though 
Chris,JED
Chris,FOCUS ON YOUR PAPER
Chris,!!!!
Chris,Nah I'm about to finish my project
Chris,Then the paper
Chris,I'm also writing a paper
Chris,The alternative energy paper
Chris,"After researching it, I'm not really sure why people like to hype up wind and solar, as they seem like the two worst options."
Chris,Nuclear >
Chris,Solar efficiency has a moores law and will be superior in the coming years
Chris,Because they are renewable
Chris,Sure they aren't very good
Chris,But they are effective in the long run
Chris,I'm saying that there are better renewables
Chris,Also solar technology will only improve
Chris,the basic idea is that it's a one-time cost you can stick pretty much wherever
Chris,hydroelectric is probably best but you can only stick it in certain places
Chris,and become cheaper while still harnessing energy at a higher efficiency
Chris,you can just shove solar panels on a roof and get a decent amount of energy
Chris,Utilities companies will never accept that
Chris,They will lose a lot of revenue
Chris,they can't entirely stop you as far as I know
Chris,They can lobby against it
Chris,I wrote another paper on that
Chris,even on personal property and stuff?
Chris,damn that's dumb
Chris,If you have solar pannels you have to sell the energy back to the grid
Chris,"Or if you use the power yourself, and don't use the grid"
Chris,You have to pay for the power that you would have used
Chris,well
Chris,that's dumb
Chris,indeed
Chris,I am fairely sure that is how it currently works atleast in Ontario
Chris,Hooray for lobbying
Chris,"I know at my house we just pay for an alternate provider who gets their stuff from renewable sources, which is an option but I don't think they generate enough total energy to supply a particularly large number of people"
Chris,"basically we just take energy and they pump that much more into the grid (and pay a bit extra, so we also pay a bit extra)"
Chris,lol marss camera tricked himself
Chris,To me it looked like he did neutral B instead of down B

Boomer: lv48 Wailord (died to a crit)
Snek: lv46 Dragonite (got ice beam'd)
(also brought 3 garbo pokemon)

Progress: Agatha three mons down"
Chris,Will Chris finally win one?
Chris,almost certainly
Chris,we introduced some new rules for elite four to prevent stalling and it kinda depends on how far kameron makes it
Chris,aight chris just won
Chris,Why would you ever want to stall in a race?
Chris,"if everyone else loses, winning strat is to just grind till you're overleveled and then make it further"
Chris,so we changed the rules so the first person to reach the elite four doesn't have to make it as far to win

Chris,seems mega stupid
Chris,Yeah but you said it took like 20 gb per hour or something crazy right?
Chris,Supposedly
Chris,I didn't look too deep into it
Chris,But its supposed to stream the game from the cloud
Chris,Which I think means it runs the game from the cloud
Chris,Yeah
Chris,SO I think the  idea is you dont need a device to process it you can just play from anything that can stream it
Chris,or rather you dont need a good device
Chris,Yeah
Chris,So I found a little more

Chris,kameron likes his hair long because he loses 1 cm of pingo for every 1 cm of hair
Chris,^
Chris,its a 1:1 hair to pingo reverse relationship
Chris,"f(p) = p * -h
Where f(p) is a function of the relationship between
p (pingo length)"

Chris,The open A.I bot that could produce extremely realistic written text did a debut on reddit
Chris,It would respond to everyones comment with a paragraph of text
Chris,"Heres what it said to me saying 
""In the beginning man made memes."""
Chris,"OUTPUT:
The internet was meant to let us enjoy those memes because we saw them. In their mind man made memes was as much an expression of man's self to be seen as any other. This is a sad state of affairs and we see it again and again in the work of art.When a new art forms is created men take what they need to reproduce the original. They put in what they can, this will bring the art back, and this will lead to new art forms. This works like ""We need to love something and enjoy it"" but it is an extension of the original. It is the same with art.> 
This process creates new forms of artistic expression. This is what the ""songs of history"" are all about. It creates new forms of expression. I would much like to hear about these great works that are being created through this process. They are all in this world. People like you that love art will listen to the work of these artists and create a great work of work. I would like to hear about some of these great works through your community. Here's what you can do to help. Take a look. A man made meme> 
This is how the creator of these works came to get his name. This is an interesting thing. If you don't know this guy, the Internet is really the most amazing thing ever to happen to the internet. People have created a new art form to be reproduced in and around our public spaces. Now all we see is this guy being made a poster and that's it.> 
You know this meme is great and you just want to help a few people. Here are some links to help you out. This is why we are so hard at work to create the memes we deserve. If you want to know more on this and more great works about this we're here to help.> 
The Art of Making> 
And this is a must get for everyone at work. If you are one of the lucky few you will get a copy of The Art of Making. We've put together this guide to help you make sure everyone has a copy of The Art of Making. We hope it helps you too!

Chris,I found a no kap in the wild
Chris,safe now
Chris,?
Chris,spoilery things in another channel
Chris,@Neurotic you a bitch
Chris,jk u a nice guy
Chris,i never understand these sentiments
Chris,it seems like every person on reddit agrees with and spouts this garbage
Chris,Yeah
Chris,This isn't even true
Chris,like yeah you CAN do well with low tiers
Chris,People be dumb
Chris,but it PROBABLY WONT BE FUN
Chris,Falco laser spam is arguably better at low level for example
Chris,YOUR CHARACTER LITERALLY HAS LESS OPTIONS
Chris,= LESS FUN
Chris,also most people probably consider winning kinda fun
Chris,the second part of this post just isn't even true
Chris,"most people can identify what makes a character good pretty easily, even people who don't understand the game"
Chris,"ie chrom kills early and is fast, ylink has projectiles"
Chris,But Kirby cant die 4Head
Chris,I built a machine learning pipeline that can predict with 70% accuracy how many defects one of the parts we are going to produce will have
Chris,Feelsgoodman
Chris,Whats everyone up to these days>
Chris,?
Chris, 
Chris,Wrote a lab report on the BMR of mice
Chris,We is BMR?
Chris,Big Mega Roast?
Chris,Basal metabolic rate
Chris,What were the conclusions of your lab results?
Chris,Basically how much energy your body needs to run at rest
Chris,A mouse uses about 7.625cal/hr/g
Chris,So 7.625 calories per hour
Chris,per gram of body weight it has
Chris,How does one calculate these metabolic rates?
Chris,In laymans terms please
Chris,❤
Chris,"I'll tell you later, I'm in my lab now"
Chris,@here how do i get rid of this bullshit in the corner
Chris,No idea it seems like a new 'feature'
Chris,hover over it
Chris,and there should be an X
Chris,in the corner
Chris,THERES NO X
Chris,then you lost gg
Chris,guess im just gay
Chris,problem solved guys
Chris,its a bug
Chris,not a feature lol
Chris,Too bad you have the gay now
Chris,@SWIRL GIRL ive got that shit too
Chris,howd you fix
Chris,prob just restart ?
Chris,i didnt fix it
Chris,waiting on discord to fix it
Chris,Results from survey
Chris,n = 91 (so far)
Chris,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot surgeon to perform a critical surgery. (Heart Transplant, Gastric Bypass, Spinal Poliomyelitis Surgery, Surgical Ventricular Restoration ETC...)"
Chris,
Chris,"Would you be comfortable allowing an Artificially Intelligent Robot to perform basic Nursing duties (pre-post operational care, taking: pulses, temperatures, blood pressures, monitoring and administering medication and intravenous infusions)"
Chris,
Chris,Do you feel an Artificially Intelligent Robot could provide emotional support during recovery?
Chris,
Chris,Do you think a ban should be placed on Artificially Intelligent Robots preventing them from entering the healthcare workforce to prevent medical professionals from being ousted from their jobs?
Chris,
Chris,Would you trust the diagnosis of an Artificially Intelligent Doctor?
Chris,
Chris,Looks like I was in the minority for those last three
Chris,It appears the general consensus (If this sample is representative at all) is that a reasonable portion of people are comfortable with SOME form of A.I assistance in healthcare
Chris,same
Chris,for what chrius said
Chris,@Trapezoider I think a resonable interpretation of this data would be if A.I assistance in healthcare was proven to be a benifit based upon evidence people would be comfortable in using it on themselves that's why a mojarity would say maybe i think
Chris,Yeah
Chris,What
Chris,There isn't really enough data on this for people to have informed opinions
Chris,"For me, as someone who knows how far the academic research has advanced, I can see how application of A.I is superior in many different medical domains  when compared to the best human Doctors. For the layman however, they don't have knowledge of the ground breaking developments  to answer these questions knowledgeably"
Chris,yea i think the reason there are so many maybes is because either the data is not there or people don't know enough about the data
Chris,yea exactly
Chris,that's why i think if people knew what maybe you did there would a lot more yes's rather then all the maybes but i could deff be reading a lot more into the data then i should be
Chris,I think the sample size is too  small to be too confident in our answer
Chris,"As far as sample sizes go, this is pretty good"
Chris,i mean this is deff not a good representation of the population my dude at least not this server
Chris,Yeah
Chris,Im gonna see if I can send it to people at work
Chris,I could easily get 800 responses from this plant alone
Chris,I think of all the questions a consensus should be reached about the first question. Human Surgeons make mistakes and some of those mistakes are sometimes fatal. It would be universally better to have ai or nano bots or whatever performing that part of the medical process. Thats the part people fuck up the most on lol\
Chris,Agreed
Chris,Now the A.I community needs to figure out how to explain to the public the work they are doing
Chris,It should be simple lol guess not
Chris,It's not simple to explain this stuff in a way that people trust
Chris,unfortunately the reason for that is cause generally people are uneducated on the subject
Chris,Even though I'm demonstrating empirically superior analytics at my Internship (compared to our business analyst team) I am encountering strong opposition to Machine Learning
Chris,Precisely
Chris,It's gonna take a lot of time to shift the zeitgeist on this issue
Chris,Thanks Alot Stephen Hawking scared everybody in the 90s
Chris,@Trapezoider stop using big words u stupid idiot
Chris,yeah
Chris,ya dumb
Chris,^
Chris,but like unironically using words like that makes you sound like you carry around a pocket thesaurus
Chris,He does
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,Its some fucking r/iamverysmart shit
Chris,I think that was an appropriate use of the word for the actually meaning that would not have  a good substitute to get his point across
Chris,"""zeitgeist"""
Chris,how bout popular opinion
Chris,actually zeitgeist does not even make sense in that context
Chris,because it refers to something from the past
Chris,and this is the present
Chris,so popular opinion actually makes way more sense
Chris,^
Chris,
Chris,It doesnt only apply to the past lol
Chris,Did you read the definition at allÉ
Chris,?
Chris,well we don't know what the zeitgeist of the current time is until the current time is over so it kinda does
Chris,I cant read
Chris,
Chris,"also the word is usually used to refer to historic timeframes, example ""the 60s"""
Chris,Reading hurt my pee pee
Chris,"""demonstrating empirically superior analytics"""
Chris,this just word salad
Chris,I dont wanna get hung up on semantics but and im not saying the way he said things was good or bad but i think it is fine to use big words to describe specifics if it makes sense
Chris,im just saying that if you talk that way dumb people are gonna think you're smart and smart people will probably think you're dumb
Chris,Fair
Chris,"I just hate the negaive look on ""big words"" use them if you can and they make sense"
Chris,i would change that to use them if you need to for it to make sense
Chris,'big words' typically will have very specific use cases
Chris,Or just don't overuse them in everyday speech
Chris,using them whenever you can will make your speech more confusing
Chris,Like an essay or a paper etc.
Chris,even then
Chris,But it real life its like trying to up the word count
Chris,you shouldn't use big words in a essay just to sound smart
Chris,you should use them if they're meaning aligns with the message you are trying to convey
Chris,In an essay big words can be used effectively to describe the 'seriousness' of the situation
Chris,eh
Chris,But again there's a limit to that
Chris,i dunno about that
Chris,Just don't overdo it
Chris,Hey Kameron
Chris,How about you eat cock
Chris,there is a difference between big words and formal language
Chris,Zeitgeist was the appropriate word
Chris,Literally false
Chris,it clearly wasn't
Chris,
Chris,Read it and weep
Chris,It clearly was
Chris,"""Current believes and ideas of the time"""
Chris,of the time
Chris,i.e.
Chris,The past
Chris,2010's is a time period
Chris,I am conducting this survey now to see how things evolve over time
Chris,"yeah but its not even a ""defining spirit or mood"""
Chris,10 years from now the zeitgeist around A.I and A.I in healthcare will be entirely different
Chris,fear of ai is not a defining spirit of the 2010s
Chris,Yeah but we as people in the present have a poor understanding of the majority consensus on topics
Chris,It is in my circles
Chris,Fear of A.I is one of the most discussed topics of the people I work and hangout with
Chris,My intellectual life is dominated by this topic
Chris,Man andrew you're really smart
Chris,Man Kameron you're a really big asshole
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,Ill make that asshole gape a little wider
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,"But Kameron, what I was saying about big words in an essay was essentially the idea you said"
Chris,"I'm sorry if you feel I'm tossing together a word salad, but this is the world I live in. Bullshit meetings and emails and fucking retarded standardization of everything"
Chris,I just didn't know how to express it
Chris,hence the quotations around the word seriousness
Chris,yeah
Chris,Everyone at work ACTUALLY emails and talks like that
Chris,Andrew have you heard of the theory of great filters as connected to the Fermi Paradox?
Chris,Yes I have
Chris,I think it is entirely likely that surviving AI could be the final filter that nothing passes
Chris,Maybe A.I is the bottleneck that prevents most civilizations from becoming intergalatic
Chris,This is why I'm entering the field. I want to ensure we build safe A.I and don't destroy everything we care about
Chris,I think that's the idea
Chris,We develop alternate realities
Chris,That we live in entirely
Chris,i.e. they are so advanced that we think it's reality
Chris,eg. the Matrix
Chris,That we kind of just forget about progression and stuff
Chris,Who knows where all this is going
Chris,All bets are off the table
Chris,"Go read Perfect State by Brandon Sanderson, it's basically that idea"
Chris,Sorry let me phrase that in words kameron will like
Chris,Also its only like 60 pages
Chris,I think that finding and increasing the genetic basis for IQ in humans would be a far safer approach to increase our scientific progress then creating AI.
Chris,all gambling activities have after careful consideration been labeled not available as actionable items in the workplace environment
Chris,?????????????????????????????
Chris,That's what I call a fucking word salad
Chris,much better
Chris,holy shit
Chris,@Max
Chris,I disagree
Chris,It's an interesting take on how a matrix-like system could work in a way beneficial to the happiness of mankind but at the cost of other stuff and all around its a solid story
Chris,"Andrew, what is your view on transhumanism?"
Chris,I don't think you can get enough of an increase in intelligence from using CRISPR to edit genes. Brains are about as big as they can be due to birth canal size. I think the way to go is high bandwidth brain interfaces. A third neo-cortex in the words of Kurzweil
Chris,"I think transhumanism is dogmatically adhered to too much, especially by silicon valley type people. Transhumanism is a good goal to aim for, but with some asteriks* to ensure we don't accidentally destroy ourselves (genetically engineering superhumans---->super bug that wipes out everyone etc..)"
Chris,I'm off lunch break boys. Have a nice day. Thank you for keeping my mind busy with fun discussions ❤
Chris,@Mr. Airplane @The Rona  I think that when ever your trying to communicate with people it's probably more importent that the people you're communicating with understand the message you want to convey over saying it as efficetly as possible. If we work off this premise then the best way to communicate is to use words that almost everyone will understand thus making your message hopefully easier to understand for the people your communicating with agreed?
Chris,zain ur late we already finished this discussion

Chris,"these are probably the worst characters, voice-wise"
Chris,or maybe I'm just used to being annoyed at them cause I play both of them
Chris,"Whenever I play ultimate with Ava or with her in the room, she always comments on how annoying Ike is because he makes so many war cry type noises."
Chris,ike's voice is way better than this
Chris,that is true
Chris,^
Chris,i think if I had to listen to those voices for 5 minutes i would blow my brains out
Chris,they're not that bad
Chris,they're like the two worst anime voice archetypes
Chris,true
Chris,extremely squeaky little girl and edgy man child
Chris,@Homies come chill
Chris,there was some debate in the queen's fgc discord over who the edgiest character in the game is between that guy and this dude:

Chris,"Should we go to universal studios, SeaWorld,  or disneyworld"
Chris,??
Chris,Universal studios is also pretty sick
Chris,They got some nice rides
Chris,Universal is the best of those three options
Chris,"You gotta go to adventure Island though, that's where the better rides are (it's a part of Universal studios)"
Chris,Also it's the one with Hogwarts
Chris,^
Chris,adventure island is really cool
Chris,the main park is more movie focussed while adventure island is more ride focussed
Chris,^
Chris,but I agree its probably the best of the three
Chris,honestly disney is kinda boring and its usually mad crowded
Chris,If you like roller coasters
Chris,Adventure Island has probably one of my favourites
Chris,in the Hulk ride

Chris,it's really good
Chris,?
Chris,eaten raw whipped cream
Chris,What is the difference between that and regular whipped cream?
Chris,it hasnt been cooked
Chris,"I'm pretty sure he either means
a) non-whipped cream that you're supposed to whip, or
b) just straight whipped cream without putting it on anything"
Chris,
Chris,I have done both of these things
Chris,the first was honestly much less exciting than the second
Chris,i think @Trapezoider was referring to whipping cream which is hella gross to drink and is not the same as whipped cream
Chris,whipping cream > raw buttermilk
Chris,especially if you're not expecting the buttermilk
Chris,So
Chris,Did you drink whipping cream
Chris,just a bit
Chris,or just whipped cream by itself
Chris,stop drinking things alone that are supposed to be ingredients in other things
Chris,I have done some terrifying things with whipped cream

Chris,"so yesterday at work I was talking about danganronpa with one of the other interns, and I tell him that I've been taking a bit of a break from danganronpa 3 cause I'm pretty sure at least one of my favourite characters is gonna die and I don't feel like going through that right now, he asks me who my favourite characters are, I tell him my two favourites, and on the second one he literally goes

""Oh I remember when he dies!""

I'm now playing again and man just died."
Chris,i bored
Chris,I'm down to do stuff once I'm through this bit of danganronpa
Chris,that'll probably be at least an hour though
Chris,You favorites always die
Chris,"yes, they sure do"
Chris,I still have one left
Chris,and they are extremely suspicious
Chris,This is why you don't tell people who your favorite characters are
Chris,If your favorite doesnt die then you cant pick good characters to favorite
Chris,Sylki that's so bm of that guy what the heck !! So much for a spoiler alert
Chris,yeah kinda
Chris,"it totally is, I'd be mad"
Chris,oh I am
Chris,"but also that whole chunk of the game I played today was really, really good"
Chris,so I'm less upset than I was before just cause it put me in a better mood
Chris,even though one of my favourite characters died
Chris,ooh that's a nice way to look at it
Chris,also I would have been more upset if the character hadn't been raising death flags left and right for 90% of the game
Chris,I just kinda assumed he wasn't gonna make it and honestly I'm shocked he survived this long
Chris,haha just don't get attached to characters like that
Chris,you can't just not get attatched to characters
Chris,danganronpa's good at what it does
Chris,no I'm joking I feel ya
Chris,i should probably play that at some point
Chris,do eeeet

Chris,"@Max 
1) I should just run back instead of shielding all the time, running backwards is really good
2) I need to focus more on not getting hit
3) I think when I am at mid percents I go  for risks thinking I won't die but characters in this game can kill at like 0 so I should stop doing that"
Chris,All solid points
Chris,@Ultimate anyone down?
Chris,I guess I'll play some more

Chris,once I stopped being dumb it was too late
Chris,then I played a villager
Chris,my palu got 3 stocked cause I dunno what to do vs fair/bair

Chris,thats whats weird
Chris,ok you need loss-of-focus-proof tourney nerves
Chris,try listening to music?

Chris,theres just no friendlies setups at our fests
Chris,so i get cold
Chris,"find something that suits the mood you're looking for - a lot of people go for intense stuff to hype themselves up, I go for more chill stuff to keep myself from getting titled or overly aggressive, it kinda depends what you're looking for"
Chris,also are there setups pre-bracket?
Chris,we had very few setups today

Chris,Just become a teacher
Chris,Factz
Chris,Summer for the rest of your life
Chris,"maybe, but also no"
Chris,
Chris,kids are terrible
Chris,No money lel
Chris,If teaching payed better I totally would do that
Chris,it pays well in canada
Chris,I really enjoy teaching people things
Chris,Maybe in the states you don't make a lot
Chris,I would totally do adjunct professor ship
Chris,"not obscenely well, but pretty damn well"
Chris,Canada is real good
Chris,But getting tenure is hard AF
Chris,you can also teach grade school
Chris,easier to get into
Chris,kind of
Chris,I would want to teach highschool
Chris,cause at least in toronto the teacher's union is a mess
Chris,Fuck elementary
Chris,I remember I once wanted to teach english
Chris,and then I started editing people's essays
Chris,Gg
Chris,and I realized I could not look at high school-level essays for the rest of my life
Chris,I also realized that basically no one cares about english in high school
Chris,Gotta hit up that math / science
Chris,I've peer proofed some of my friends work before and holy hell some people don't know how to write/spell
Chris,"we got to choose from a huge number of damn good books to read and do a few essays on, including Oryx & Crake and Watchmen, I think other than a few people who read Watchmen because comic book I was the only person in the class who actually read the book"
Chris,which our teacher was well aware of and kinda roasted people for which was funny
Chris,but they can't actually do anything about it
Chris,and I think as a teacher I wouldn't take that very well
Chris,"In my English class, we have to do peer review for every essay and after peer reviewing 6 essays I can agree that most people don't know how to write. What amazes me is when people don't even properly follow the assignment instructions."
Chris,yup
Chris,most people consider english a filler course and don't bother putting in anything more than the minimal required effort
Chris,What's funny is how much they are gonna get fucked for that poor skill
Chris,More than math I have to write so many proposals and emails
Chris,Well I try to get an A in everything. Both because it makes getting in to the school you want more likely and I'm just a tryhard at everything by nature.
Chris,Not being able to take control of the written word is such a burden
Chris,2 years into college and I still have a 4.0 
Chris,I've ended up being saddled with handling like all the writing for all the interns at my office
Chris,As long as I get above a b I don't really care but when it comes to my job I'm a tryhard
Chris,I don't even understand half the stuff I'm doing write ups for
Chris,"That is with a math every year, 2 Biology courses, and 1 chemistry course."
Chris,If only jobs check GPA
Chris,he's going for actual college tho
Chris,which sure as hell check gpa
Chris,"I also am going to try for a scholarship to save my parents $25,000"
Chris,that too
Chris,man US college is pricy
Chris,FactZ
Chris,that's almost as much as my 4-year degree plus four years of housing (including the very pricy year in residence with a meal plan)
Chris,Yaw bruh
Chris,actually since it's in USD it's probably more
Chris,Im lucky I got 2 years free
Chris,My community college is like $900 as semester though so that's pretty cheap
Chris,yeah but it's community college so you kinda get what you pay for
Chris,"Professors are a mixed bag. I've had some great ones and some terrible ones. Student body is what you would expect from the price, most people seem far below my social class."
Chris,Lmao imagine having your parents paying for your college
Chris,They planned on doing it so why would I complain?
Chris,technically my grandpa's basically paying for my education cause he left a ton of money for it in his will but he's still alive so he's just kinda paying most of it now anyway -_-
Chris,I'm not planning on going to a 4 year school anymore
Chris,also most people can't afford to put themselves through college on a part-time job
Chris,especially not in the US
Chris,"What are your plans, Jed?"
Chris,Too fucking expensive even with a bunch of scholarships
Chris,"Prolly community college, I'm not sure if I'm gonna stay at home or move somewhere"
Chris,just come to canada for school
Chris,although we do charge extra for foreign students so it's probably not much cheaper
Chris,I might try and learn a trade or something not totally sure yet
Chris,I could have a job with John deer in Montana if I wanted to move out there
Chris,ok I just checked and international students pay like triple the domestic tuition
Chris,maybe don't come to canada for uni
Chris,at least at queen's
Chris,"it's like:
one year of eng degree, domestic: 7k
one year of eng degree, international: 23k"
Chris,That's about as much as my future school I think
Chris,the domestic or the international?
Chris,Yeah that's about the same as gcu before scholarship
Chris,International
Chris,^
Chris,oof
Chris,Gcu was gonna end up being 11k a year
Chris,Too many people go to college anyway
Chris,"that's eng tho, which is one of the pricier ones"
Chris,I think that only smart people who care about learning should go
Chris,"If you are just going to go, get C's, and skip class a lot why bother?"
Chris,C's get degrees
Chris,"cause the degree makes it easier to get a job, and as the saying goes, ""C's get degrees"""
Chris,dammit chris
Chris,you beat me
Chris,Maybe post-acceptance they do
Chris,For me I still need the A
Chris,What do you call the guy who got a C in medical school?
Chris,A doctor
Chris,Doctors
Chris,Exactly
Chris,Why get an A when I can get B's and C's and earn money while going
Chris,Being in Machine learning means I have to keep up on scientific papers and research constantly
Chris,My education doesn't end in college
Chris,I was mainly saying I wish college was less essential for life so it could be an option for smart people to specialize in a technical field.
Chris,I mean it's not gonna matter in 30 years
Chris,None of us are likely to be better than computers at anything
Chris,Good luck getting a science job on a high school degree
Chris,max that's what non-undergrad degrees are for
Chris,I know
Chris,College is still a minority pursuit
Chris,The average person doesn't attain higher education

Chris,Large aminos
Chris,I hope you all are doing well
Chris,:-)
Chris,Today is kind of a work mess
Chris,"At like 5 my manager gives me a task, passes me over to another guy to get more details. From the details I realize any solution like what he wants is gonna be extremely gross code. I do a bit of experimenting and realize there is no way to do it without rewriting a huge portion of the backend, so I ask both the guy who explained what I should do and my manager for clarification. Both had since left the office and gone offline on slack. In desperation, I reach out to the other guy who knows about the bit I'm working on (who is literally on his way to the airport) to ask for help, he suggests a less awful solution, I go ""great, but I don't have access to that code, can you give me access?""  That was fifteen minutes ago. He is presumably busy doing real life things and will not be getting back to me. This was implied to be a somewhat urgent task."
Chris,-- Tldr -- I'm kinda fucked because I got an urgent convoluted task and i don't have access to the code and everyone who might be able to help is gone
Chris,Pinned a message.
Chris,Oops
Chris,Damn discord mobile why do you put pin and edit right next to each other

Chris,nairo how did that just work
Chris,this is gonna be a wack vod
Chris,"Marss (ZSS) vs Nairo (ZSS, Wolf, Robin)"
Chris,HOLD THE FUCK UP
Chris,HE WENT DARK PIT
Chris,RANDOM SMASHER
Chris,how does he look so serious
Chris,MARSS IS LOSING STILL??
Chris,my best guess is he's feeling like mars figures out his characters later in the game but he's winning cause he gets an early lead so he's just swapping every game?
Chris,but like wtf nairo
Chris,you go down 0-2
Chris,fucking
Chris,500 iq
Chris,"switch to wolf, win"
Chris,"switch to robin, win"
Chris,switch to dark pit for game 5
Chris,NO WAY
Chris,lol
Chris,what was that
Chris,aight marss figured it out at the end
Chris,but honestly whaaaaat
Chris,Pit is so bad
Chris,alright marss is my favorite player but.......
Chris,he still almost got it tho
Chris,NAIRO IS INSANE
Chris,like that was still really close
Chris,this tourney is mega hype
Chris,salem beating dabuz with shulk
Chris,real question tho
Chris,like
Chris,why no palu
Chris,mkleo's sick joker
Chris,marss is very up vs nairo's palu
Chris,tweek vs mkleo winners finals
Chris,hot damn this man's joker is nuts
Chris,mkleo is crazy
Chris,I'm loving the fast fall upair regrab shenanagins
Chris,well i guess this tourney isn't hype anymore
Chris,mkleo's pretty nuts I dunno
Chris,mkleo just gonna stomp peeps
Chris,tension = 0
Chris,true
Chris,unless somehow marss gets into grands
Chris,but it's still hella nice
Chris,i dont think anyone else can beat leo
Chris,samsora always loses to leo and tweek just got bodied
Chris,I feel like tweek could try some other characters and he might have a chance
Chris,dunno how matchups gonna work
Chris,
Chris,loving these town and city games
Chris,
Chris,stage variety 4head
Chris,lets just remove all the interesting and distinct stages
Chris,ike pog
Chris,I'm focusing so hard on this match
Chris,Have to study both sides
Chris,the best players of max's two characters
Chris,except leo i guess
Chris,they're actually both playing super well
Chris,this is a great set
Chris,I'm better at down throw follow ups then mars lol
Chris,He missed some easy ones
Chris,"roy might be a wacky weight for it, I'm not sure"
Chris,he's a weird weight for a lot of things
Chris,tweek is getting demolished
Chris,That was brutal
Chris,if only marss beat tweek so that this set could have been close
Chris,nvm
Chris,im loving the dynamic between the top players in ultimate

Chris,Bruh
Chris,:-(
Chris,Wait if that was the whole conversation then he totally in the wrong

Chris,@Homies How is website? http://pathtoneuralink.com/
Chris,Pretty sure this is an error
Chris,
Chris,????
Chris,THAT IS STRANG
Chris,I am seeing that too
Chris,
Chris,@Zain
Chris,What is causing this
Chris,is it the '
Chris,it happened on the bottom too
Chris,that is so weird
Chris,Its wherever I use apostrophe or quotes
Chris,Hmm
Chris,Let me bugfix
Chris,I've seen this before on my poorly designed home school website. I'm not sure how to fix it but I'm pretty sure that its replacing non-letter characters like ' with stuff.
Chris,Looks like I have to use the unicode character for apostrophe's and quotes
Chris,@Sak von Sak Is that my problem?
Chris,it shouldn't be a problem but it depends how you've put together the non-html parts of the website maybe
Chris,it can't hurt to unicode it
Chris,I have no backend
Chris,Its all shiny sauce
Chris,is your front end just raw html & css?
Chris,Yes
Chris,weird
Chris,Bootstrap for the navbar and footer
Chris,Font awesome
Chris,Simple stuff
Chris,"something weird is going on with the formatting, I'm looking at it in chrome dev tools and there's a lot of weirdness"
Chris,No don't roast my code
Chris,does this happen locally?
Chris,
Chris,no like the way chrome is interpreting it is weird
Chris,What am I looking for?
Chris,"just, if you test this code not in the site does it have the same problem?"
Chris,no
Chris,Well
Chris,I don't know now
Chris,Because I unicoded everything
Chris,it might be something weird with whoever's hosting it
Chris,Dreamhost
Chris,They are freaky
Chris,but also I don't know why you have quotes in your <p> tags
Chris,it shouldn't be necessary
Chris,uhh
Chris,I dont
Chris,That is weird
Chris,Wait
Chris,"<p """">"
Chris,"or <p>

STUFF
""""

</p>"
Chris,the second
Chris,oh
Chris,"<p>
""
stuff
""
</p>"
Chris,"should just be
<p>stuff</p>"
Chris,I wrote all the P tag content in a word document and probably put unecessary quotes
Chris,Any other tips for formatting stuff?
Chris,I can't tell for sure cause what I'm seeing isn't your actual code
Chris,just how chrome is parsing it
Chris,Problem has been resolved
Chris,Thanks unicode
Chris,it's still weird that it was happening in the first place
Chris,Yeah I looked in my code
Chris,I didn't put quotes inside my p tags
Chris,Chrome is weird
Chris,or dreamhost has HIV
Chris,probably dreamhost

Chris,It was
Chris,rip
Chris,106-105
Chris,wow close
Chris,The raptors missed 9 points in the last minute
Chris,Then the last shot of the game that could have one it
Chris,Was nowhere near the basket
Chris,Literally hit it off the backboard
Chris,Why don't they just split the game into 5 quarters instead of 4 and play best of 5 quarters. That would make more of the game feel impactful.
Chris,Too bad these sports are too established to ever make a common sense change like this.
Chris,i was tryna trade with some guy in PoE but he was speaking korean so i got my korean speaking friend to help me

Chris,Got
Chris,a god damn
Chris,shift
Chris,we all said yes
Chris,@Homies Road Trip! we getting the whole gang together to go fight @Zain
Chris,What a great idea to spend time with the boys
Chris,And fuck @Zain
Chris,what did he do
Chris,"We start with picking up me then we cross the border to get kameron then we cross the border to pick up schlef then we cross the border to get jed and andrew then we cross the border to get chris then we cross the border to get smithy and karina then we cross the border to get zack then we cross the border to get max and ava then we cross the border to fight fusion then we cross the border to go to LAX to all fly home, we're leaving hte car there"
Chris,That is the worst route lol
Chris,it is optimal for border crossing
Chris,What do you mean?
Chris,Why are we doing this
Chris,Can you come up with a better one?
Chris,Also come get me
Chris,Me and chris are basically next to each other
Chris,because zain is a raidboss so we need to get the entire party together to combine our strength
Chris,maybe they want a long road trip for fun uwu
Chris,okay because zack complained i have cleaned up the route
Chris,Yes that's much more sane
Chris,okay but why in the first place
Chris,why are we fighting zain
Chris,i need to throw hands with zain
Chris,he knows what he's done
Chris,and i need my team to back me up
Chris,
Chris,It's only like 3.5 days of continuous driving
Chris,So practically about a week
Chris,i prefer the 2 weeks of continuous route
Chris,oh then we gotta get back
Chris,so double it
Chris,What happened to ditching the car at LAX?
Chris,witht he optimal route we dont do that
Chris,Ah
Chris,So it's time & distance efficient but not cost because we lose the cost of the car
Chris,Probably a van actually
Chris,We are taking Mike's 5 seater
Chris,Its gotta fit like ten of us tho
Chris,we will strap yall to the top
Chris,
Chris,Are we doing this?
Chris,I am so down
Chris,I'll help pay for gas 
Chris,
Chris,Guys can we please do this
Chris,even distribution its about $500 a person
Chris,Uhh
Chris,uh
Chris,
Chris,4200 miles / 300 miles per tank = 14 fillups
Chris,we but we renting an rv
Chris,to fit everyone
Chris,14 fill ups x 12 gallons  per gillup = 196 gallons
Chris,4 dollars per gallon x 196 gallons = $784
Chris,/ 7people = $74 per person
Chris,How much is an RV rental?
Chris,yeah but we renting an rv so at 100 a night figure 3 weeks thats 2100 plus its not as fuel efficient as your estimate
Chris,all these numbers are calculated with the route where we ping pong across hte country and go over hte border 9 times btw
Chris,Lol No!!!
Chris,XD
Chris,Don't use that route
Chris,Take the optimal one
Chris,nah
Chris,What's even the point if we don't use the non-optimal route
Chris,I CANNOT AFFORD THE SUB OPTIMAL ROUTE
Chris,sub optimal route or we walk
Chris,Bet

The reason for this will become apparent once it begins. For now, all you need to do to help me prepare for this event is to post the names of things you like (probably around 5-10 things would be the best number) in the submissions channel. You can post anything, from something as vague as ""history"" to as specific as ""pizza""."
Chris,@The Rona I'm down for OoT randomizer

Chris,
Chris,
Chris,@Meetup Created a role for @ing meetup related people. I gave this role to everyone who will possibly be there. The official days for the meetup were decided yesterday as July 19th (Friday) to July 29th (Monday). The airport Chris's dad would like people to fly in to is Toronto Pearson (YYZ). If anyone has a problem with these days please let us know soon so we can possibly make slight adjustments before I buy my plane tickets.
Chris,is it okay if i fly into Hamilton Regional (HAM)?
Chris,You literally live there dude
Chris,You can but you would have to walk over
Chris,F
Chris,ac work
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,Fighting Game Controller Tier List
Chris,I almost agree with this
Chris,"But I would at least put the power glove up to A, maybe even S"
Chris,maybe swap the power glove and the vive?
Chris,Due to how easy it is to control
Chris,N a h
Chris,just
Chris,bump the glove to A tier
Chris,Yeah
Chris,Like top of A
Chris,
Chris,Ok looks good now
Chris,I would reverse this and move the wii remote and it would be perfect
Chris,you really think fighting your opponent IRL should be 2nd bottom tier?
Chris,tbh I had no idea what that picture meant
Chris,it means clocking your opoonent in the jaw so you are the only remaining fighter
Chris,honestly that strat is pretty foolproof
Chris,and its a controller cause you control who actually is able to play
Chris,s tier free
Chris,Yeah but the one drawback it has is that it only works during lan
Chris,Because of that I think it deserves the A spot
Chris,Mmmmm you could just swat them
Chris,Would that count as it's own thing though?
Chris,Or an extension of fighting them
Chris,I would
Chris,i would
Chris,"@Meetup Tickets purchased! People Currently confirmed: Max, Chris, Zack, Benson, Devon. Pending: Andrew, Kameron, Jed. Definite NO: Zain, Smithy, Ava. Toronto Frostbite meetup 2019 is looking to be very good."
Chris,Anyone in need of a passport should take care of that as soon as possible
Chris,
Chris,Excited
Chris,take me off hte list
Chris,i aint going
Chris,oh okay
Chris,im starting my own meetup
Chris,
Chris,with blackjack and hookers
Chris,you know what
Chris,forget hte hookers
Chris,ill be in devon's pool
Chris,the meetup is exclusively in my pool
Chris,once you enter
Chris,you cannot leave
Chris,put me down as a definite yes for dober's sick pool meetup
Chris,
Chris,Aw hell yeah
Chris,
Chris,How are you going to play Blackjack in the pool though
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,already got it covered
Chris,Fuck
Chris, flight would only be $500
Chris,And passport is like 100 I think
Chris,@Max what other things would I need to account for costwise
Chris,uhhhh
Chris,It'll probably depend on if I can take a week off work
Chris,We are staying at Chris's house
Chris,Food/activities?
Chris,I'm not really sure how much of that we need to buy
Chris,Chris should tell us how much his planned activities cost
Chris,@Jed Want the meetup role for regular updates and access to the meetup planning channel?
Chris,Yee
Chris,I'ma try and make this work
Chris,Work will be my only problem I think
Chris,I'll go and revise my earlier message
Chris,@Mr. Airplane if I end up going to the Meetup and you don't I'll fly to Maryland and tell you that I'm disappointed in you
Chris,Oh shit
Chris,Jed coming now too hopefully
Chris,
Chris,I have the money it's all about my work
Chris,Try to book it off right now
Chris,Cause I just started last week and I'm already taking a week vacation this week
Chris,oh
Chris,You can do it
Chris,I believe
Chris,Sending positive vibes in your direction
Chris,I'm not a super essential part of the farm yet like I'm just an extra pair of hands
Chris,So hopefully 
Chris,farm?
Chris,And honestly this Meetup is probably more important to me than this job
Chris,Yeah I work on a farm now
Chris,what kind of farm
Chris,like whats growing
Chris,the devil's lettuce
Chris,
Chris,Yeah we grow hemp
Chris,But it's also a dairy and other crops
Chris,oh shit dawg
Chris,Literally every farm in Oregon is growing hemp cause it's the only place you can
Chris,Also there's a chance I'll be able to get a day or two off during the meetup bit I'll have to ask pretty far in advance so if we could figure out which days would be best ahead of time thatd be good
Chris,The meetup has been decided as July 19th to 29th
Chris,@Max cs?
Chris,^
Chris,Sure be there soon
Chris,@Sak von Sak We should probably be able to work around whichever days are easiest for you
Chris,They'll all be about equal except some Wednesdays and Thursdays
Chris,@Cs:go
Chris,@Max join up dork
Chris,I meant more for events that I normally wouldn't be able to join cause they'd be during work
Chris,
Chris,Joined the server.

Chris,@The Rona that's your house right
Chris,Yeah
Chris,I might be fucked passport wise
Chris,Just get it now
Chris,

Chris,I think there should be an Express option.
Chris,I have a valid passport card
Chris,So idk if I just need to renew and get a book or apply for a new one

Chris,chris when down?
Chris,cause i ain't staying up late anymore
Chris,don't think I want to
Chris,why not 
Chris,The amount of time required to be good enough at a game to have fulfilling speedruns of it is time I would rather spend doing other things.
Chris,i dunno about that tho
Chris,i feel like once you pin down the necessary tech runs should be pretty fulfilling
Chris,I ain't staying up late anymore either

Chris,Just get your license idiot
Chris,Also I don't think in gonna be able to make it @Max it's a little too last minute
Chris,
Chris,The passport would cost like 250-300 to get on time
Chris,you could also just go without
Chris,it'll take a little longer but iirc they just ask you questions
Chris,also if you were tryna fly to toronto i thought you needed ur passport anyways

Chris,@Homies games?
Chris,
Chris,@Ultimate I did a thing
Chris,
Chris,By popular demand
Chris,dont agree with g&w especially with that frame three upb out of shield
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,=
Chris,
Chris,"For those who didn't know, Ally (28) has been exposed for being in a gay relationship with Captain Zack (a MINOR) and has now retired from smash. Let him never return and hopefully go to jail."
Chris,"Uuuh you're missing some important parts, cause I'm pretty sure it was technically legal age-wise (just extremely, extremely sketchy), the real issues from what Ive heard of the situation involved physical and sexual assault"
Chris,"So yes, hopefully he ends up in jail"
Chris,But hey at least this isn't like the Nightmare situation where it was technically legal and he had tons of people on his side
Chris,But he'd basically forced a 16 year old to date and sleep his 24-year-old self
Chris,At least people are pretty universally against ally
Chris,(Also tbh it's weird to me that you focused on the gay part rather than most of the actual problems)
Chris,(Most people already knew that they're both gay)
Chris,"Aight I looked into it a bit more and apparently the assault stuff was exaggerations and theorizing, so that's less bad at least"
Chris,Still creepy borderline pedophilia and I'm glad its come out and that ally is retiring
Chris,But he's not gonna end up in jail cause it was technically legal
Chris,Max doesnt care if it was legal
Chris,pride month is over
Chris,     
Chris,that makes me sad. ally was such a good player
Chris,"I wouldn't say I focused on the gay part at all, I just mentioned it for those who might be unaware. I literally capitalized the word minor to avoid this problem and show the area I was emphasizing. But I guess people would read it that way anyway because its me. Just to clarify, no, I do not think gay people should go to jail. I was referring to the fact that he was dating an underaged person."
Chris,yeha i agree with max there it didnt really seem like he focused on it more like an offhand comment
Chris,"I mean a) you started with gay, which is usually an emphasis thing, and b) it has no bearing on it being problematic and the phrasing makes it sound like you're giving it roughly even billing with everything else. I get that it wasnt intentional but also given your general opinions it doesn't necessarily come across as such."
Chris,"Well, sorry if you took it the wrong way. Maybe I should have left out that detail entirely given my history."
Chris,Also there's a bit of an issue with people who do equate homosexuality and pedophilia so its definitely somewhere to watch your phrasing for potential misinterpretation
Chris,"I definitely see a difference considering one is consensual and I only object for religious reasons, which you may not agree with but I hope you at least understand. While the other is taking advantage of a difference in intelligence and being a predator."
Chris,"Was basically making sure there wasnt a misunderstanding, and also at the time I thought there had also been assault which I thought was more important to mention"
Chris,gamers rise up and join vc im lonely
Chris,In short: poor communication kills and we both didn't do a great job

Chris,Isn't that the guy Zain always mentions?
Chris,Yes
Chris,his whole brand is debating dumb people
Chris,which as a concept is already pretty trashy
Chris,Mob Psycho 100 season 1 finished. Totally not for me but I get why its popular. 6/10
Chris,@Mr. Airplane many people today believe in some pretty crazy ass shit he does debate these crazy people. If he or other people like him waren’t to do this they could and would push there agenda and make more “crazy” people and so thats why its good that he can will and has debated these crazy people. On the topic of likeabilty this is entirly subjective so if you don’t like hin alright cool i guess.
Chris,wow dude i didn't realize that destiny was so heroic
Chris,truly the savior of our generation
Chris,"hi man i'm just addressing the points you brought up. i wake up and i see my lord and savior destiny chan being insulted can't believe this, but in all seriousness he's not a nice person to any extent but the reasoning you brought up for not likeing him is pretty week"
Chris,@Mr. Airplane i dont think destiny is the least likable person on the internet I'd have to say its def @The Rona. Destiny is a close second tho

Chris,the question was what book does moses lead the jews out of egypt
Chris,The old testament or the Torah as the Jews call it.
Chris,the asnwer was exodus
Chris,Oh you meant like that
Chris,I thought you meant more generally
Chris,wouldn't that make the bible the bible part 2
Chris,and the book of mormon the bible part 3
Chris,That would be the case if a Jew is the one answering
Chris,It is a matter of perspective

Chris,NEURALINK UPDATE [OFFICIAL]
Chris,"This is not a Path To Neuralink episode. This is my take on an official announcement from Neuralink. At around 6:50pm 7/10/2019, Neuralink announced via Twit..."
Chris,Alright question time
Chris,Is it rude to make a phone call on a bus
Chris,Not is it allowable but is it impolite
Chris,It depends on how loud you are being
Chris,Like if you are asking everyone on the bus to quiet down so you can hear
Chris,That's rude as hell
Chris,But if you've got earbuds in or something
Chris,You good
Chris,???
Chris,How do earbuds change anything
Chris,I don't know how to explain that any other way
Chris,Also obviously emergencies are exempt
Chris,I think talking on the phone on a bus is obviously rude
Chris,People just don't understand the concept of public spaces
Chris,What's the difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you?
Chris,I don't think that talking to someone next to you on the bus is polite either
Chris,But...
Chris,I mean
Chris,Just don't be loud
Chris,One could argue that talking on the phone is more avoidable
Chris,I mean for you to be heard in a bus or metro you gotta talk kinda loud
Chris,This is why earbuds are effective
Chris,You should be able to hear them without problem
Chris,And you don't have to talk as loud if you speak directly into the microphone of the earbuds
Chris,"I feel like if you try to keep the conversation to a minimum we good, but if you're voluntarily entering a conversation that's pretty rude"
Chris,It's a matter of respecting public space
Chris,I guess
Chris,Ok both of you are wrong how is talking to the person next to you rude and how is talking on your phone rude and obviously I'm talking about at a respectable volume
Chris,if you think talking on the bus is rude ur a bitchass
Chris,Dude that's literally my argument at the beginning
Chris,Just keep it at a respectable volume
Chris,if someone on a bus talks so loud to the point of a problem someone will tell them to shut up
Chris,Bro if you guys don't understand the significance of the discussion you're so obviously part of the problem
Chris,My argument is that people fail to respect public spaces
Chris,our argument is that the discussion has no significance
Chris,Yes if you just circumvent the entirety of my argument obviously I appear to be wrong
Chris,if youre bothered by people talking in a public space then you have the problem not the speaker
Chris,public spacws arent inheritly silent
Chris,Respect public spaces people can still talk to each other and respect the people around them
Chris,I agree with boi Greg
Chris,yes zain that's true but again that's not really my point
Chris,also greg
Chris,'s argument is actually braindead
Chris,YOU CAN'T CHOOSE TO BE IN A PUBLIC SPACE OR NOT ITS NOT YOUR FAULT IF ITS UNCOMFORTABLE
Chris,???
Chris,that actually makes zero sense to me
Chris,BRO IF YOU DONT LIKE  RACISM JUST MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE
Chris,4HEAD
Chris,
Chris,I gotta say this is a mess
Chris,thats not a good comparison tho
Chris,racism is a real issue people talking on a bus is a mild annoyance at best
Chris,I don't see how talking in a public space is a problem
Chris,i mean the conversation was fine until these two bozos just lack the understanding of what's being discussed entirely
Chris,ok does people talking in class bother you
Chris,what about a library
Chris,not really
Chris,If I'm riding the bus with a friend are we both supposed to just sit there in silence?
Chris,Kameron
Chris,^
Chris,also just because it may not bother you it can bother others
Chris,Wait stop those are completely different spaces
Chris,That's what I said
Chris,Those are terrible examples
Chris,that too
Chris,Both with existing expectations of quietness
Chris,A bus is not a silent space
Chris,Those comparison are so bad'
Chris,ok but there aren't many other public spaces
Chris,the park
Chris,Cause in a class you're supposed to listen to a teacher
Chris,the street
Chris,"its not a matter of does it bother me, its about respecting the wishes of others"
Chris,And all libraries have rules against it
Chris,In a public space that has no predetermined rules of being quiet
Chris,But how do you know it bothers them
Chris,u can talk as you like
Chris,the street does not fit into the way we are using 'public space' here
Chris,This clearly something you think
Chris,BUSES ALSO HAVE RULES AGAINST TALKING ON THE BUS YOU MORONS
Chris,???
Chris,they literally do
Chris,Not the buses I'm on
Chris,Likewise
Chris,if you really are causing serious trouble for someone then they have to notify you to stop or just deal w it
Chris,Also ive never heard of a bus with talking eules
Chris,its not a matter of serious trouble its a matter of respect
Chris,Kameron I want your source
Chris,What the fuck kind of buses do they have where you live???
Chris,its not a rule as in if you break it you're removed
Chris,Respect towards who
Chris,i can confirm busses here have no such rules
Chris,but a lot of busses have signs that say to keep noise to a minimum
Chris,bro where
Chris,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/bus-commuters-hold-all-calls-or-else/
Chris,"Bus Commuters Hold All Calls, or Else"
Chris,"On some New Jersey commuter buses, cellphone use is banned. But some passengers defy the rules and make business and personal calls, which leads to confrontations with drivers and other riders who demand quiet."
Chris,"Yeah there's a difference between a conversation and what they're talking about, which is stuff like yelling or blasting music"
Chris,Ok that's wack
Chris,Thats siper weird lmao
Chris,2008
Chris,why new jersey gonna have some rule like that when like
Chris,And I've never seen anything like that anywhere I've been
Chris,proper cities with populated transport dont
Chris,That's interesting by that I mean retarded
Chris,There's literally no difference between talking on the phone though and talking to the person next to you
Chris,Again
Chris,Just keep it respectable
Chris,yes chris I agree
Chris,Also this article is from 2008
Chris,ok ill admit its the first thing i found
Chris,but you guys were like: 'this doesn't exist'
Chris,it definitely exists
Chris,but you probably have not looked for it
Chris,well everything probably exists but a exception does not make the rule
Chris,this is the same argument as sniffling during a test
Chris,it simply demostrates a lack of understanding that your actions may impact others around you
Chris,Sniffling is uncontrollable tho its totally not
Chris,false
Chris,you can
Chris,Wait what
Chris,bring a tissue
Chris,wipe your nose on your shirt
Chris,Sniffing is deffinitly controllable
Chris,Just wipe your nose
Chris,ask to go to the bathroom
Chris,if a tissue isnt provided or if you forget then what
Chris,wipe your nose on your shirt
Chris,thats actually nasty
Chris,imagine getting upset at people sniffling
Chris,
Chris,Mike
Chris,"Shut up, whore"
Chris,
Chris,so mad
Chris,realize that you are sick and then should bring a tissue for your test
Chris,Just dont be sick
Chris,
Chris,plus a test still has an expectation of quiet so sniffling is still.more severe than talking on a bus
Chris,its not a matter of severity my guy
Chris,A bus has no expectation of quiet
Chris,ok that's just raw false
Chris,so there is no reason to assume people want quiet
Chris,if someone wants quiet then its their job to ask for it
Chris,if someone played their music on the bus without earbuds would people be annoyed
Chris,NO ITS NOT
Chris,in a library its different
Chris,you shouldn't have to ask others to be respectful
Chris,if someone plays music such that its annoying then just tell them to stop
Chris,yes but that doesn't mean its rude in the first place
Chris,Its not disrespectful to not assume people want quiet
Chris,*not rude
Chris,Greg is totally wrong here
Chris,^
Chris,You just shouldn't blast music out of your phone on the bus
Chris,well no you shouldnt
Chris,Nobody wants to hear that shit except for you
Chris,because loud music is always annoying
Chris,It is though
Chris,"but talking on a bus isnt usually annoying, especially at a reasonable volume"
Chris,yes we all agree
Chris,If it doesnt cause problems in general then why is it suddenly disrepectful
Chris,that makes 0 sense
Chris,because using the condition reasonable volume inherently means that what you are doing isn't disrespectful
Chris,"again, your example is unrelated to the argument"
Chris,If you want silence in a place that does not demand silence then its not everone elses job to know you want solence
Chris,??????
Chris,Ur arguement is also totally related
Chris,im actually done discussing this with someone who clearly doesn't even understand the issue
Chris,breakfast time
Chris,You cant just say theres an issue and assume i will accept that
Chris,you have to establish the problem first
Chris,he said no and left
Chris,bruh i told you its breakfast time
Chris,i already said why its a problem
Chris,I dont assume everyone is going to be quiet unless its a place like a library
Chris,I dont think its rude for people to play music in public
Chris,Kameron your argument is actually retarded. People pointed out a valid flaw and you moved the fucking goal post
Chris,@Homies game time
Chris,@The Rona 
Chris,Certified gamer moment
Chris,@Trapezoider i see what you mean and ur probably right i think how i phrased the initial question was not what we ended up discussing tbh
Chris,but yeah my initial take was overly spice
Chris,im gay
Chris,yikes
Chris,thats pretty gay
Chris,also chris apparently investigations have a better chance of the odogaron gen
Chris,I already got the gem
Chris,Also Gavin was the one who typed that message

Chris,Attack on Titan Season 3 is actually amazing and one of the best shows I've ever seen
Chris,Highly recommend
Chris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UH_ys1jnDg
Chris,Money joon
Chris,@Max agreed I finished it like two weeks ago
Chris,h e c k  y e s
Chris,1000000/10
Chris,Rise up gamers
Chris,Shows fucking excellent
Chris,Can't wait for season 4
Chris,
Chris,Its labeled as the final season if you were not aware
Chris,No
Chris,Not facts
Chris,I looked into this
Chris,
Chris,Straight from myanimelist
Chris,https://www.google.com/amp/s/screenrant.com/attack-titan-season-3-game-thrones-mistakes/amp/
Chris,Attack On Titan Is Making The Same Mistake As Game Of Thrones
Chris,"Game of Thrones rushed its ending, now Attack on Titan is doing the same."
Chris,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1148984/Attack-on-titan-season-4-release-date-cast-trailer-plot-when-is-attack-on-titan-out/amp&ved=2ahUKEwjN6YPQhK7jAhVGIDQIHUifCbEQFjALegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw0J1Soh4WbfKnbZkWHLrajo&ampcf=1

Chris,You are wrong
Chris,There's still like 50 chapters of manga
Chris,
Chris,I don't think that matters
Chris,This season could be long
Chris,also manga chapters are short
Chris,MAL only posts verifiable information
Chris,like most manga I've read where I've also seen the show it's usually like 2-5 chapters per episode
Chris,(5 is usually for fights where the action that takes up a lot of panels takes not a lot of screen time)
Chris,Wow so that wouldn't even be a full 12 episodes at 5 per episode
Chris,(it's usually closer to 2-3)
Chris,@Ultimate ultimate?
Chris,Max season 3 part 2 is over
Chris,I know that
Chris,The show has another season coming
Chris,Next summer
Chris,Yes that is what I was saying
Chris,Omg
Chris,4head
Chris,Also its October
Chris,WHAT
Chris,no tis july
Chris,its october
Chris,YO THATS WAY SOO ER
Chris,@Feral Nebula FACTZ?
Chris,yes
Chris,NEXT October
Chris,^
Chris,at least for now
Chris,2020
Chris,because AOT has a track record of changing plans
Chris,so don't count on it one hundo percent
Chris,They may want to time the manga and anime to end at the same time to maximize sales
Chris,@Max @Sak von Sak ultimate?

Chris,I made the comeback though so its fine
Chris,last few minutes of D&D then sure
Chris,I'll join after getting some food
Chris,I also discovered a really cool pika edgeguard where you drag down with fair and then footstool. I have no idea if I could repeat it consistently but it was so cool. Gimped a mario at like 60%.
Chris,lol fiction's DI is so bad
Chris,melee looks so much worse without slippy
Chris,
Chris,He is using all the wrong moves
Chris,"Max, you didn't deserve that GSP anyways, Pika is annoying
~ Benson probably"
Chris,Pikachu is so much fun
Chris,i dont hate max that much
Chris,to say shit like that
Chris,I like Pikachu too
Chris,tweek game 5 vs a brawlhalla player monkaW
Chris,Who?
Chris,sandstorm
Chris,Wrenched
Chris,Oh
Chris,
Chris,Who does the brawlhalla guy play?
Chris,he's playing ken
Chris,ken is busted
Chris,Ken seems pretty good
Chris,I've always been a Ken believer
Chris,Ken got buffed
Chris,He used to be terrible
Chris,I stand by what I said
Chris,Imagine wearings knee wraps when squatting less than 135
Chris,I don't even know what analogy to give to explain how stupid this guy is
Chris,It's like spending $1000 on a custom GameCube controller for your first tournament
Chris,Smh
Chris,Maybe he has weak knees
Chris,Nonono
Chris,Not those type of knee straps
Chris,I'm talking knee wraps that apply so much force on the lower half of the squat that your legs can do nothing BUT GO UP
Chris,
Chris,Meant for guys to squat 800 lbs
Chris,Very bad for the knees
Chris,
Chris,Maybe he's just weak as fuck
Chris,And needs those to lift
Chris,4head
Chris,That's not how dis work
Chris,@Master Memers TF2

Chris,because twitter sucka da large pp
Chris,Nestle’s children companies
Chris,@Master Memers TEAM FORT LATER
Chris,Yes Sir
Chris,Wizzy just won the smash 64 major
Chris,Zain 4 stocked Hbox
Chris,zain 4-stocked hbox
Chris,woah
Chris,
Chris,If you watch Leffen's restream he is pointing out all the stuff Hbox is messing up. Its actually really funny how much stuff he gets wrong but doesn't get punished for because he is puff.
Chris,hbox bad
Chris,leff man real good
Chris,Hbox's DI is actually so bad
Chris,'dreamland isn't a free win for puff' is such a pepega opinion
Chris,alright puff is the best character in the game im down
Chris,especially in b05
Chris,Welcome to the club
Chris,marth #2
Chris,b05 actually favors puff and marth so hard
Chris,Having a free win is nice
Chris,It sure would be good if we had a ban... 
Chris,it actually makes viewing melee so much less fun
Chris,Ultimate is over an hour late lol
Chris,Puff is so interesting
Chris,I'd never thought id see the day where i was waiting for another smash game bored outta my mind watching melee
Chris,The ruleset needs to be updated to reflect the new meta
Chris,Make Melee Great Again
Chris,"Ban wobbling, ledge grab limit, bans in bo5"
Chris,100%
Chris,At least ultimate nerfed Olimar
Chris,Olimar being not as good makes the game so much better to watch
Chris,ultimate meta is kinda neat
Chris,the problem is that the boring matches in melee are also alot longer than the hype ones are
Chris,Banning puff would make the game more interesting
Chris,so like 3 boring matches in a top 8 takes up half the time
Chris,... or more
Chris,unfrozen stadium 
Chris,Why are they good for bo5?
Chris,"anyone: lands 1-2 hits
toph: THATS BIG DAMAGE"
Chris,Bo5 has no stage ban. Puff and Marth each have a stage they are massively favored on vs most characters.
Chris,I dont like toph
Chris,hbox di lol
Chris,Pepelaugh
Chris,sad
Chris,pillowpet guy pog
Chris,DALLAS LUCKY
Chris,I feel like I'm listening to a conversation of exchange students ^

Chris,I love this game
Chris,twitch chat can probably claim to be a proper dialect at this point
Chris,4 people on commentary is too much
Chris,especially when 3/4 aren't very good
Chris,alright scratch that it's 3 commentators the 3 not good ones
Chris,Twitch English

Chris,is 15 all there is? I don't want a repeat of yesterday
Chris,Yes
Chris,get devon to send the picture at some point before i finish if you guys want it in the video
Chris,So my parents are selling our house
Chris,And the real estate agent came over
Chris,but I didnt know that
Chris,So I walk out of the bathroom
Chris,Oh pog they are moving in with you
Chris,In nothing but my undies
Chris,
Chris,Thats a way to meet someone
Chris,Nah
Chris,They arae moving north
Chris,@Trapezoider you got an apartment already?
Chris,yessir
Chris,when are you moving into it?
Chris,also I'm sorry to disappoint but I just can't do the daily vlog today
Chris,i can throw it together if you want but I seriously can't take anymore of this meme editing right now
Chris,or maybe not even that why is this taking so long to accomplish nothing
Chris,I'm so irritiated
Chris,I don't want to do this anymore
Chris,Don't blame me when there is no vlog today
Chris,
Chris,hey
Chris,don't be mean to me
Chris,you guys are putting pressure on me to spend hours of my day everyday making dumb memes
Chris,it's starting to stress me out
Chris,
Chris,get devon to do it like he originally was
Chris,Devon is here though
Chris,We have no way to edit
Chris,uhghdughudfhgksjdfskldjf
Chris,maybe I'll try again later
Chris,I still need that photo of the bathroom and the video from Benson
Chris,"but probably no more memes tomorrow. Don't expect too much, it really does take a lot of time. (also I might be busy all day the 24th and 25th)"
Chris,okay well this one is done. I'm rendering it rn. I didn't do either of Benson's requests both because the first one took too much editing and the second one bc I never received the clip for it.
Chris,Just to make a statement if you guys really need me to I can continue editing the clips together if for whatever reason none of you can but the fancy editing and memes will be minimal from here on out because this is taking upwards of two and a half hours everyday and it's really draining. glad you guys enjoyed the memes while they lasted though.
Chris,i enjoyed it for the first two days but its just too much im sorry

Chris,how much does fighter pack cost?
Chris,25 dollars yikes
Chris,That's for everyone though
Chris,yeah but i thought that hero only costs 6 dollars
Chris,so it'd be cheaper to buy 4 characters
Chris,and then not buy banjo cause he looks dumb
Chris,
Chris,real talk you'd probably still save money cause most tournaments give you a discount for bringing a setup
Chris,and not having all the characters means they can't use your setup
Chris,Yeah but Kameron dumb
Chris,i dont really want tournies to use my setup cause then i'd have to stay there after going 0-4

Chris,ok
Chris,then we play mhw
Chris,but then the day after i get back i go to new york for a splat lan
Chris,We can play tonight tho
Chris,"Random idea: Settlers of Catan could be made into a more consistent game by replacing the dice with a deck of cards with the numbers 1-12 on them. The deck would have the same number of each number as that number has dots on the board. For example, there would be one card with ""2"" and one card with ""12"" while there would be five cards with ""8"". The deck would be completely drawn through before reshuffling. This would ensure players get the exact return they should on their investments into certain tiles and would eliminate a lot of randomness from the game."
Chris,doesnt that give a totally unfair advantage to the person selecting second
Chris,since the second person geenrally had the best choices overall for picks
Chris,I don't think this change would give an unfair advantage. There will be games where the person who picks good tiles will get an even bigger advantage if they get lucky with rolls and games where they do very poorly because of bad luck. The first scenario is unfun because that person is highly likely to win and the second is unfun because that person is just losing to luck. My rules change would just balance out the outliers and make the game more dependent on skill.
Chris,"Ultimately managing resources based on luck is a type of skill, vs knowing ""oh i have a sheep coming so I dont have to do anything"""
Chris,It also makes player trading worthwhile

Chris,"just sorta show up whenever, Kameron's finishing an OW game"
Chris,"I really dislike the design of the Hero. Random crits, random down B, random move on the down B, instant kill. Whyyyyyyyy"
Chris,@The Rona WOAH I HEARD U WAS TALKING SHIT
Chris,the hero sounds lit
Chris,what are you talking about
Chris,random crits?
Chris,that's my jam
Chris,DansGame
Chris,i love being rewarded for being bad
Chris,"Max, you listed the same point twice"
Chris,@Max
Chris,ima be back in 10
Chris,ima leave in 10
Chris,"@The Rona Those are two different reasons. The down B is inherently random by selecting 4 moves. One of the possible moves to get is a move that does something completely random, even potentially harmful to yourself."
Chris,I forgot about that one
Chris,But also
Chris,Just don't pick that one
Chris,
Chris,Guys I lost my gf and I'm scared
Chris,There's a homeless person yelling next to me
Chris,Hlp
Chris,where are you ??
Chris,Down town Salem
Chris,I seriously don't know where she went. And I have her phone
Chris,uh oh
Chris,downtown salem isn't that big. She couldn't've gone too far

Chris,although ivy got a bit nerfed
Chris,Mewtwo buffs
Chris,
Chris,also the fuck is this
Chris,world's least relevant nerf
Chris,LOL
Chris,Actually useless
Chris,Another patch of my characters not being changed
Chris,Works for me
Chris,What projectiles even do 50% ???0
Chris,Probably items/already reflected projectiles
Chris,I'm just greatful that they didn't destroy him
Chris,it might just be cause it lasts so long that you can double reflect with a single input?
Chris,but that's still... kinda dumb
Chris,Tetracon last long but not that long though
Chris,mebe
Chris,"still, I'm hyped about zard getting buffs to ftilt, fsmash (like it wasn't already hella strong when you hit it??), longer-lasting nair, and a stronger fthrow"
Chris,i can confirm that hero is retarded
Chris,but super fun
Chris,imagine slower robin with killpower
Chris,i think hero is mid high tier
Chris,once people learn the matchup
Chris,joker still best character in game
Chris,watching more gameplay of zero kicking ass
Chris,i no longer think he's mid high tier
Chris,i think he's high high tier

Chris,ok i made this cause im bored
Chris,you are underestimating accelerate
Chris,but good tier list
Chris,9/10 would agree
Chris,i also think snooze is A
Chris,accelerate just too fast
Chris,speed is usually good but you simply go too fast for it to be useful
Chris,snooze is mega slow
Chris,and thus more situational
Chris,snooze gives you free kill and you can throw ppl into it
Chris,because its slow
Chris,"also, if you can control accelerate it scary"
Chris,Yeah but Hero's grab sucks ass
Chris,"""if you can"""
Chris,not sure if its really even feasible
Chris,7/10 times i see kameron use snooze it does something stupid
Chris,also i can control it
Chris,That's because it is almost never the correct option to use it
Chris,it's not that hard
Chris,And the times where you do use it
Chris,It was the correct situation to do so
Chris,Conformation bias
Chris,"yea, yea, conformation bias with kameron's tierlist too"
Chris,i mean in all fairness
Chris,the reasoning behind all of the a and s tier spells is that they are consistently very useful in most situations
Chris,except for magic burst which is just ridiculous in certain situations

Chris,also meetup japan 2020? we goin to evo japan boys
Chris,anyone wana watch top 8 with me?
Chris,boys boys boys boys
Chris,circular television. my new latest idea.
Chris,TV's used to be round
Chris,
Chris,are you saying like miniature imax?
Chris,boys boys boys boys
Chris,spherical television my grand newest idea
Chris,no
Chris,terrible idea
Chris,^
Chris,come watch evo with me
Chris,top 8 starting
Chris,I don't know if I've ever seen a smash tournament do winner's side top 8 before loser's side
Chris,they've been doing it all day
Chris,it is a bit weird but it's an evo thing I guess
Chris,This is the first I've watched of evo
Chris,this year
Chris,Last 2 days were lan night + practice for it
Chris,i want raito to lose because duck hunt is lame
Chris,duck hunt is so interesting
Chris,he's not lame
Chris,eh I kinda like raito's duck hunt
Chris,he's got super neat setups
Chris,also this is some hella mediocre commentary
Chris,basically nothing but play-by-play
Chris,yea this commentary is trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Chris,imagine having evo top 8 and not bringing in the full blast zone 
Chris,What is the full blast zone?
Chris,"ee, tk, coney"
Chris,tricast
Chris,they have better commentators for the in-arena stuff
Chris,tk d1 ee
Chris,"not the best there is, but still better than this"
Chris,like both cinnpie and coney are good commentators
Chris,but they fill very similar roles
Chris,eeeeeeeh they're not great
Chris,but yeah definitely part of the problem is that they're both doing nothing but play-by-play commentary
Chris,"no analysis, nothing about player mentality, etc"
Chris,i'm so bored
Chris,by this commentary
Chris,it's great if you want to do something else and just listen tho lol
Chris,not for top 8
Chris,it was a joke
Chris,that you don't need to watch cause you can just listen
Chris,r/woosh
Chris,and they'll tell you everything that happens
Chris,fuck it im watching evo in japanese
Chris,ok japanese commentators are so much more entertaining
Chris,especially when you can make out a few words
Chris,thank you anime
Chris,tweek's PT is so nice
Chris,^
Chris,his zard looks so awkward tho
Chris,but then it goes so hard with the baits
Chris,his baits are so good with zard
Chris,how are they more entertaining when you can only understand like 5 words
Chris,"1, i can consintrate on the game more
2, the commintatiors react better"
Chris,ah
Chris,ayy smash 4 combos still works with fox? i thoiught they removed thoes
Chris,"some do, some don't"
Chris,i thought fair to upair didnt work anymore
Chris,no idea
Chris,it might be a 50/50 now
Chris,also lucina lookin clean
Chris,rip light
Chris,proto's looking super good tho
Chris,zackray leo for 7th monkaW
Chris,hope zack gets bodied

Chris,@Ultimate we should do some fun in house tournies more often
Chris,we'll need a house first
Chris,but yeah I know what you mean
Chris,we should do em like we used to do RoA tourneys
Chris,yeah
Chris,those were super fun
Chris,speaking of we should also play rivals more
Chris,Would we include a nerf mechanic like character banning to encourage less skilled players to attend?
Chris,yeah
Chris,that's what I meant by like our old RoA stuff
Chris,thumb wrestling tourney
Chris,
Chris,if I can get my adapter working with RoA I'm totally down to keep playing it
Chris, Japanese players are gone 
Chris,rip
Chris,The west is the best

Chris,wait no
Chris,bruh

Chris,Wait
Chris,3head
Chris,got confused by the winner's/loser's timeslot swap
Chris,lmao
Chris,Japan is west of the US
Chris,"yes, but it's still called the east"
Chris,don't ask
Chris,These terms are from Europe
Chris,Max likes Japan better than the USA
Chris,the east is just extra west 
Chris,
Chris,The terms are from the perspective of Europe
Chris,lol
Chris,Nope
Chris,"Japan west, change my mind"
Chris,do you guys wanna all watch together?
Chris,thats why im in here
Chris,Japan is an honorary western country
Chris,no one is joining pepehands
Chris,I would rather watch alone
Chris,same personally
Chris,"I'd be down for stuff after, but also I'll probably just pass out cause it'll be late"
Chris,i see how it is q.q
Chris,zard's so gross I love it
Chris,he was at like 45%
Chris,he was at 50
Chris,close to 70
Chris,so 60
Chris,i can math
Chris,i'm asian
Chris,ayo commentators not knowing how many jumps zard has
Chris,this is why im watching the japanese dub
Chris,do you know why tweak dropped wario?
Chris,He thought wario struggled too much at approaching and thought PT fit his style better
Chris,ah
Chris,i can see that with wario
Chris,I just remembered I got 13th at a brawl major
Chris,what a game
Chris,Out of how many entrants?
Chris,39 lol
Chris,and I got a bye cause one of my opponents DQ'd
Chris,"still, 13th at a major that was my first brawl tournament, with the second worst character in the game"
Chris,also I love how all these 'blast to the past' clips are just a great reminder of how much better of a spectator game ultimate is
Chris,Also just a better game
Chris,"yeah, but especially from a spectating perspective"
Chris,the gap there is bigger than the gameplay gap imo
Chris,imagine looking at smash 4 with rose tinted glasses
Chris,Smash 4 summarized
Chris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJfLLhnvrWE
Chris,Super Smash Bros. - Bayonetta Victory Theme (HQ)
Chris,The victory theme for Bayonetta in Super Smash Bros 4. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS. IT BELONGS TO NINTENDO.
Chris,doesn't rose-tinted imply I'm looking at it as if it was better?
Chris,r/woosh
Chris,Just counted and apparently I've mained 12 characters throughout my time playing ultimate.
Chris,Benson being unclear and then doing r/woosh when I'm confused is not clever
Chris,This grands should be cool
Chris,i'm rooting for tweak only because he's the underdog
Chris,I like Leo's style better so I'm for him
Chris,and yes zack it's implying that smash 4 was better
Chris,leo's style is closer to mine
Chris,so i might pick up joker and learn some stuff
Chris,I'm rooting for tweek cause PT
Chris,WHAT
Chris,"neither has an evo yet, right?"
Chris,pt tmight be the best character
Chris,"""PT isn't top tier"" ~Zack"
Chris,lol
Chris,I'm reconsidering that position
Chris,lol
Chris,I still think PT isn't the best
Chris,but I'm not as sure as I used to be
Chris,"top tier is something like peach joker pika lucina PT, no idea about the order"
Chris,at least prepatch
Chris,we'll have to see how things shake up postpatch
Chris,You forget Palu and Snake
Chris,i dont think palu is top 5
Chris,He said top tier not top 5
Chris,oh
Chris,tweak is so fkin good
Chris,YO
Chris,*leo
Chris,LEO'S NUUUUUTS
Chris,What a come back
Chris,mk is so fkin good
Chris,also joker busted
Chris,cabbage dog
Chris,reverse 3-0
Chris,tweek looked bad that game
Chris,I think he's shook from the three stock comeback
Chris,shit lookin like me vs zack when i read all his tricks
Chris,poor tweak
Chris,OHHHHHHHHHHHH
Chris,if that hittttttttttttttttt
Chris,TWEAK
Chris,Tweek not tweak
Chris,"he went too deep and basically got hit with the ""well I guess I'm fucked eithe way, might as well"""
Chris,benson pls
Chris,what max said
Chris,I don't think that was intentional
Chris,tewwk
Chris,It was totally intentional
Chris,I mean the sideb was
Chris,but I don't think he wanted to be in the position where he had to go for it
Chris,yeah
Chris,its over
Chris,yea leo has momentum
Chris,tweek won two games
Chris,then mkleo's on five straight
Chris,I saw that
Chris,yeah yeah
Chris,also I'm gonna crack up if the last game of the biggest smash tournament ever is to the tune of route 209
Chris,ill be a miricle if te\wk
Chris,fkit
Chris,typing is hard
Chris,twerk
Chris,joker's recovery is stupidly good
Chris,the japanese commentators ask what happened to tweak
Chris,tweek*
Chris,he was doing so well
Chris,poor tweek
Chris,ggs
Chris,hot damn
Chris,that was nutty
Chris,tweek almost stole it lol
Chris,Great grand finals
Chris,that was a good grands
Chris,wow dude he looks so emotional 
Chris,can we talk about that loser's run from mkleo tho
Chris,that was like eight or nine sets
Chris,wow that was a good guess

Chris,
Chris,k
Chris,oh shit what happened in leff vs salem?
Chris,some beef went down
Chris,it basically went down like this
Chris,Game 1 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is behind the whole time but makes a comeback with vine whip) Game 2 (PT vs Snake: Leffen is winning but chokes and loses) Game 3 (PT vs Hero: Leffen wins fairly convincingly)
Chris,sasuage man went to go say hello to the big leaf
Chris,but then the leaf turned sideways
Chris,then sasuage man went all hero mode

Chris,he really is killing melee
Chris,ban puff
Chris,no meme
Chris,also zain just looked so defeated after game 2 ended
Chris,man poor amsa has to fight falcon right into peach
Chris,that said he did 3-0 s2j so we'll see how this goes
Chris,there are too many lame characters in melee
Chris,matches like yoshi peach and puff marth are too slow for a top eight
Chris,yoshi vs floaties is fairly boring
Chris,yoshi is boring when amsa is losing and is thus forced to camp
Chris,he honestly does the same stuff hbox does but amsa is more likeable so people dont care
Chris,also it looks cooler
Chris,in all fairness tho llod is the one camping
Chris,llod zain losers semis maybe
Chris,none is sick
Chris,let's go none
Chris,my stream froze partway through the zain none set and I got this great screenshot just as none's getting fsmashed off stage

Chris,Lol base game wonderwoman is tier 2 fuckers
Chris,tier 2 is shit tier
Chris,It's in reverse
Chris,"6 is higest, 1 is lowest"
Chris,you buffoon
Chris,Who tf counts up
Chris,These people
Chris,the game is designed so you can play multiple heroes aslong as their tier adds up too 6 or less
Chris,
Chris,I just played better then I think I ever have in Ultimate. I was 3 stocking or nearly 3 stocking everyone I met in elite smash.
Chris,pog
Chris,"@Ultimate After years of research, I present to you my Ike matchup chart. Note: I've only played some of these matchups a single digit number of times so they may be wrong."
Chris,Ike doesn't have a plus 1 against cloud
Chris,I just suck at edge guarding
Chris,Plus i have blade beam
Chris,That can kill you at zero
Chris,On top of that i have a better neutral
Chris,Cloud has a plus 1 against ike
Chris,I also think ike loses to pit
Chris,Eeeeh I dunno about that
Chris,Nair oos hits ike
Chris,That can lead to fair and boom offstage
Chris,Plus arrows
Chris,Dead ikr
Chris,Nair oos wont hit unless crap spacing by ike
Chris,It can also antiair him
Chris,Also that combo only works at low percents
Chris,Also only preemptively cause he outranges and outspeeds pit
Chris,If you can get him off stage its doable but its super hard to win neutral at all
Chris,And he gets more off any given neutral win
Chris,Ike pit is such a fun mu.
Chris,Idk bout dark pit
Chris,It's worse cause bad arrows
Chris,So he kinda just has no place where he can wreck ike
Chris,He just sorta loses all the time instead of just most o the time
Chris,Im pretty sure fair beats his quickdraw
Chris,Imo pit ike is 55 45 respectfully

Chris,It is super easy
Chris,please do it
Chris,"This method seems to work great, I will be using it to create the actual bracket shortly. Those without a challonge account are highly encouraged to make one so they can participate. I just had Ava make one and it took her like 30 seconds."
Chris,
Chris,I'll continue this meme bracket just for fun
Chris,lightning fast rounds
Chris,You will need to refresh the page each time the round advances
Chris,"@Homies @Master Memers @Advanced Memers My voting bracket is finally here, featuring all of your finest submissions! I will be posting a link to the bracket both here and in the voting bracket channel. A challonge account is required to vote so make sure you get one of those. Don't worry, they are really easy and quick to make. Each round will be available for an indeterminate amount of time, so make sure you vote whenever you can. I will advance the round whenever it seems like everyone who would vote, has voted already. I have given a new role to everyone who gave suggestions in the submissions channel that I will use to update you guys on the progress of the voting bracket. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, remove the role from yourself. Alternatively, if you want the role and didn't get it, feel free to add it to yourself or ask a master memer to do it for you. Have fun everyone!"

Chris,Bruh
Chris,
Chris,"Goodbye, free time"
Chris,I may be getting it as well in a few weeks
Chris,you should at least try a different fire emblem game a little bit first
Chris,"just to see if the gameplay is at all up your alley, cause three houses is pretty pricy"
Chris,I just dropped ninety canadian pesos
Chris,(tax included)
Chris,"aight boys and possibly girls who have three houses, how's the difficulty in this game? ie should I play on normal or hard"
Chris,Hard pussy
Chris,
Chris,(I don't own the game)
Chris,naw I ended up doing normal+classic
Chris,Bro
Chris,You didn't even wait for a response
Chris,I waited like five minutes
Chris,you waited 3
Chris,shhh
Chris,maybe less
Chris,It was 2 minutes since my message
Chris,I'm impatient okay
Chris,jeez
Chris,Normal is too easy
Chris,From everyone iv talked to
Chris,welp too late now
Chris,Just restart
Chris,although I'm still on the prologue
Chris,so yeah
Chris,anyways if you think hard is too hard you can downgrade later
Chris,but you can never upgrade
Chris,"also side note, if I'm restarting I want to know the name of that weird chick who asks what my name is"
Chris,"so that I can give myself the same name and see if she still goes ""all y'all humans got some wack ass names"""
Chris,Sothis
Chris,I highly doubt you'll get away with it but you can try
Chris,also it'll definitely make dialogue weird eventually
Chris,I feel like its just gonna be like
Chris,"""No"""
Chris,but w/e I'll figure stuff out with pronouns cause I'm gonna be a dude
Chris,"pfft she still goes ""I shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names"""
Chris,come on nintendo
Chris,Wait are you actually allowed to do that
Chris,What is she if not a human?
Chris,wacl
Chris,wack*
Chris,based on her appearance and a few little details I've picked up Imma assume she's a dragon
Chris,also I'm 90% sure she automatically has the same birthday as you
Chris,cause she definitely comments on that one
Chris,"also, don't tell me, but if she's eventually a playable character and romance option I'm gonna crack up"
Chris,just for the theoretical
Chris,"""Do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded wife?""
""I do.""
""And do you, Sothis, take Sothis as your lawfully wedded husband?""
""I do."""
Chris,aight they don't even change sothis' lines if your name is also sothis
Chris,"maaaaan it made my weird friendship counter thing with Sothis decrease because I took the ""guess I'll die"" dialogue option"
Chris,this has now made me afraid of choosing all the snarky options
Chris,gg everyone gone
Chris,i keep falling asleep in ma chair
Chris,just go to ur bed before you fall asleep

Chris, @Mr. Airplane
Chris,2 bird 1 stone
Chris,bruh wrench'd won shine
Chris,good shit
Chris,"leffen vs moky's about to be on, this should be good"
Chris,or leffen's gonna slaughter him
Chris,jesus moky is fast
Chris,he's nuts
Chris,side note who the hell is Kevin Maples
Chris,and why is he in top 8
Chris,everything moky does is a clip
Chris,that game was so spaghetti
Chris,"mostly leffen, but a little moky too"
Chris,game five tho
Chris,MOOOOKY
Chris,YOU'RE NUUUUTS
Chris,    
Chris,LETS GO
Chris,he SD'd super low and still went nuts
Chris,that second last stock was unreal
Chris,THE MENTAL
Chris,leffen's already tweeted lol
Chris,that was so fast
Chris,all around that might have been the best fox ditto I've seen since armada retired
Chris,can leffen ever complement his opponent
Chris,that'd be nice
Chris,https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439331114397698
Chris,Played like shit but still better than I expected with no warmup. Very unlikely I'm playing losers tomorrow. Ggs all
Chris,what a child
Chris,he's been super salty all day
Chris,
Chris,Bruh
Chris,"also, it's gonna be hbox vs ibdw, and moky vs winner of sfat s2j"
Chris,I win my first top 16 match
Chris,moky could make grands winner's side if ibdw wins
Chris,i think ibdw would win a fox ditto
Chris,if sfat beats s2j i could see ibdw winning the whole thing
Chris,yeah
Chris,"I wasn't saying moky would be favoured to make winner's side grands, just that it's not improbable"
Chris,like 1/3 maybe
Chris,@Mr. Airplane https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1165439884292743168
Chris,"Don't get me wrong, mokys sick and has been putting in work, he def deserves winners top 8 way more. Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"
Chris,
Chris,i mean gave him credit after giving like 8 johns and threatening to dq himself
Chris,he's been threatening to DQ himself all day lol
Chris,like several days actually
Chris,"""Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"" and its an underhanded complement"
Chris,I mean they both SD'd a bunch
Chris,and I don't think that's so bad honestly
Chris,like it's a bit john-y but w/e
Chris,and I think it's fair given his SDs game 4
Chris,I'd be hella salty
Chris,I personally have no issue with the way leffen talks. It seems he uses a variant of the Max mindset.
Chris,eh he's been really salty in general at shine
Chris,"like zero respect for anyone who beats him, puts all the blame on stuff that... he controls, at least to a degree"
Chris,every ult bracket he blames matchups he doesn't know
Chris,and like yeah he's trying to learn stuff but at a certain point you just gotta suck it up
Chris,"You've just described the Max mindset. In short ""Its always my own fault""."
Chris,That is a great mindset for a winner
Chris,yeah but I'm saying he's not doing that
Chris,"he's blaming it on other stuff, like lack of sleep, or bad scheduling, or not knowing the matchups"
Chris,Blaming SD's or playing bad or lack of matchup knowledge are all things that you did wrong
Chris,he's putting the responsability on everything but himself and his opponent
Chris,bad scheduling is the only thing you listed that is not his own fault
Chris,okay but the sleep thing is a huge john
Chris,Have you tried flying 6 timezones or so away and then having to play 13 hours in one day with no sleep
Chris,yes but he chose that
Chris,Seems hard and like a legitimate excuse
Chris,it's like blaming that you're playing a low tier
Chris,"like yeah, it's a disadvantage"
Chris,but you chose the disadvantage
Chris,he didn't have to play both games
Chris,You can choose to switch mains. You don't choose to be born European.
Chris,fly in earlier
Chris,only play one game
Chris,he was considering it
Chris,"and he doesn't get to both decide he's in the position to play both games despite everything else, then when he loses blame those things"
Chris,Its better than people dropping our constantly to preserve a reputation. Imagine a world like that.
Chris,I'm glad he entered both games
Chris,but that's not what I'm arguing about
Chris,"I don't think the move to preserve his reputation would have been to only enter one, it would have been to not bitch about things that were at least partially under his control when things don't go his way"
Chris,By reputation I mean ranking and future seeding
Chris,but that's not what we're talking about
Chris,we're talking about his behaviour and mentality
Chris,I'm saying I would rather people stay in bracket and john when they lose instead of drop out whenever they think they are not playing their absolute best to preserve their ranking.
Chris,"I'm normally on his side for a lot of things, but I think that the sequence of events of:

1) call out flaws with tournament
2) suggest how he could handle them better
3) not follow his own suggestions
4) bitch about the things he didn't avoid

is not a good look"
Chris,"once you've reached 3), you're not really in a position to complain about it"
Chris,I really don't even understand how his actions could be interpreted as points 2 and 3 but whatever.
Chris,"he goes ""I should drop out of melee so that my sleep schedule and all that is intact cause I'm not really feeling it, plus fuck shine for making such a dumb schedule so their tourney should suffer for it."" That's #2. Playing anyway at the cost of his sleep and proper warmup for either game is #3. Blaming the tournament structure and his lack of sleep and warmup for his losses is #4"
Chris,"my point isn't that he shouldn't have entered both games, it's that once he's committed to that, knowing full well all the issues it would cause him, I don't think he's entitled to complain about it"
Chris,"again, it's like choosing a low tier. Yes, playing a low tier disadvantaged you, but you knew what you were getting yourself into, so suck it up or change characters. Don't blame the game for not making your character good"
Chris,Welcome to 2019 everybody. A world in which a minecraft parody song by Captain Sparklez is the top trending song of the month. Lol how did this happen.

Chris,I had the weirdest discussion with my housemates today
Chris,we spent like 45 minutes discussing one question
Chris,"""Can a person be taller than they are old?"""
Chris,any baby
Chris,done
Chris,it spiralled off into like four hours of weird random stuff and it was a great time
Chris,"Chris, explain"
Chris,because the deeper you get into the specifics the more insane this conversation can become
Chris,babies are 0 years of age
Chris,babies are taller than 0 of any measurement for length
Chris,Therefore yes
Chris,A person can be taller than their age
Chris,yeah that was me and one other guy's argument
Chris,"but it got into a convoluted discussion of the meaning of age, weird semantics, and we eventually ended up talking about quantum physics"
Chris,Interesting
Chris,...
Chris,...
Chris,"basically one guy's point was that age cannot be zero, since its the amount of time that has passed since something came into existence, and if no time has passed, its age just flat out doesn't exist rather than being zero"
Chris,"Well okay, even if you are one year old, you are probably taller than one of any significant form of measurement"
Chris,Or once it does begin to exist after itnhas been born
Chris,yeah but no kind of measurement was specified
Chris,It's age will be somewhere between 0 and 1
Chris,Therefore my original statement holds true aswell
Chris,"also the fact that time and distance aren't really comparable, regardless of unit"
Chris,which is how we ended up in quantum physics
Chris,I mean I guess but in the context we can assume we are just comparing absolute values
Chris,can we though
Chris,do you even know the context
Chris,the context was wack as hell
Chris,
Chris,it came from a badly translated article about yao ming's daughter
Chris,how we got to that is another story
Chris,but also it's late and I should sleep
Chris,so gnight all
Chris,Goodnight
Chris,I was typing periods to test my lag since I wasn't able to send messages
Chris,Those periods took several minutes to actually register as sent
Chris,alright played a banjo online

Chris,"i still got 17th because i won in winners, but i coulda done much better"
Chris,"had my first kingston weekly since april 2018 yesterday:
ultimate (https://kingstonsmash.challonge.com/KU33): 38 people, I got 9th, but only because I lost to 4th seed (who won the whole thing), and then immediately got the top seed cause he sandbagged with banjo in winner's. Looking at who I would have had to fight if I he hadn't sandbagged, I would have had three people I've never lost to, so I probably should have gotten 4th. Also Lucas is a super wack matchup that I've never played so I'm glad I beat both the ones I fought.
melee (https://challonge.com/raw0xlb4): smaller tournament because there's a bigger event today, got 4/17, lost to 1st and 2nd, and all close games (0-2 for both, but still mostly last-hit games). Also, my marth is not ready for sheik. Beat a pr'd sheik where he jv3'd my marth and then I double two-stocked him with samus. Got 2 PR wins so I think I'm well on my way to this season's PR.
various traditional fighters that didn't have brackets: I'm nutty at unist even on a controller I'm not used to. Guilty gear is really fun but also really fucking hard, and I'm gonna be really upset if I end up with yet another fighting game where I hate the visual design of my best character."
Chris,"now today I've got a bigger melee tournament that should have more of the PR (yesterday only had half the PR), and more people in general, and a proper unist bracket that I think I'll be able to place in the money for, so long as I can stay somewhat consistent with a weird control scheme"
Chris,When my life is crumbling apart but it’s my birthday so I gotta play it cool 
Chris,
Chris,@Ultimate Someone fight me
Chris,I can't seem to join voice in here so I'll be in frostbite 1
Chris,tfw you dont have frostbyte 1
Chris,@Galf
Chris,Going to a tournament wish me luck. Also what character should I play @Ultimate ?
Chris,Banjo Kazooie @Max
Chris,No
Chris,Pokemon trainer
Chris,Then why ask
Chris,
Chris,Welp I did terribly in melee
Chris,"Between pools and bracket, 1-4"
Chris,Mostly respectable losses but I feel like I should have won 3 of them
Chris,"On the flip side, second in unist"
Chris,Got the reset bracket into get 3-0d classic
Chris,well zack
Chris,looks like its time to come back and play me in ultimate instead
Chris,i lost to two pts so gotta grind 
Chris,I'm 1-1 right now. Likely fighting a Samus next
Chris,ya boi made five entire dollars from UNIST today
Chris,and only spent 14 on the tournament and food
Chris,and honestly I'm more happy that I didn't get 3rd than that I got 2nd
Chris,because getting 3rd would have involved losing to someone who started playing unist last night
Chris,he brought me to game 5 last round
Chris,Basically double 3 stocked the Samus. My Palu is looking clean.
Chris,Next match is the winner of an inkling ditto. Anyone got any tips for this matchup?
Chris,@Max just play bowser 4head
Chris,@Sak von Sak wanna jame jamer?
Chris,Beat the inkling but lost to the same wolf player I lost to round 1 rip.
Chris,Went 3-2
Chris,Got 7th
Chris,Got seeded terrible since no one knew who I was so I'm satisfied with my performance. Aside from 1 game of ike I went all Palu.
Chris,i think
Chris,bowser is actually bad vs heavies
Chris,10/10 would recommend abandoned 1800s Masonic cemeteries
Chris,Bro
Chris,Bro
Chris,We deadass were leaving and heard laughing around us
Chris,We looked it up later and it's common for people to be chased out and get scratches from a witch who was hung and buried there
Chris,And we all thought we were good but we got home and one of my friend checked his back and he had a long scratch mark down his back
Chris,That cemetery is the #1 most haunted place in oregon
Chris,Are you sure he didn't just get scratched on a tree branch or something?
Chris,It was 3 scratches going sideways across his lower back
Chris,It didn't look like a scratch from a bush
Chris,And one of our other friends refused to go because he had gotten a deep scratch the last time he went
Chris,MonkaW
Chris,We were chilling and my stomach just dropped and I told them we had to get out of there before 12
Chris,I had a feeling bad shit would happen if we were in there when it hit 12
Chris,It was wack
Chris,Just checked yesterdays bracket and I actually got 5th not 7th
Chris,nice
Chris,Guy who double eliminated me got 2nd

Chris,Maybe poker later
Chris,This game is really fun
Chris,I like the rabbit character
Chris,Well come play
Chris,
Chris,I'm home in 1.5 hours
Chris,The game is not fun but the art on that particular character's cards is rather amusing
Chris,@Max
Chris,I'll play poker
Chris,Poker?
Chris,Ayy
Chris,Let's go
Chris,Max I read a short book on poker
Chris,What @Trapezoider ?
Chris,So I don't suck now
Chris,I mean I still suck just not as bad
Chris,I've done a fair bit of reading on poker so I like to think I'm pretty decent when I'm full tryharding
Chris,But doing that means folding like 70%+ of hands so I rarely do
Chris,It just becomes boring for everyone
Chris,Pls play
Chris,You're just folding most of the time anyways
Chris,What the heck
Chris,truth
Chris,Chris I'll play as soon as I'm home
Chris,Your game then poker
Chris,I mean is that not pro poker anyways
Chris,foding 70% sounds about right
Chris,"Like I said, that is the correct way to play if you want to win, it just is more fun to play a lot of hands."
Chris,according to my dad i'm weird in that i play the same whether or not money is involved
Chris,I would never play poker for real money
Chris,i mean even for somehting liek 5 bucks
Chris,I am opposed to gambling
Chris,fair enough i suppose
Chris,@Trapezoider we playin poker soon or wha t
Chris,Did y’all end up actually playing poker
Chris,Hello
Chris,No we did not
Chris,I thought I would be home sooner
Chris,But repairing my window took longer than expected
Chris,Smh
Chris,@Zain Can you use your mode powers to get me a massive CSV of every message sent in chillin ?
Chris,I'm not sure that is possible
Chris,This is so sad
Chris,I'm learning about language models
Chris,and I wanted to train a net to generate text that is basically the average of frostbite
Chris,
Chris,Just go highlight everything
Chris,
Chris,I would also like to see some data science with the chat
Chris,you could probably make a bot that would just scrape the entirety of a channel
Chris,Like who has sent the most messages etc.
Chris,"I'm not positive cause I""ve never worked with discord's api 'n stuff, but it should be doable"
Chris,Its totally possible i recalla  friend of mine doing something similar
Chris,not for frostbite obvs but
Chris,Can you reach out to him and find out how
Chris,I could train something by the end of the day
Chris,It would be like the olive garden commercials
Chris,sounds neat
Chris,@Trapezoider just ctrl+a 
Chris,>.<
Chris,
Chris,oh god
Chris,what have they done to discord light theme
Chris,
Chris,I don't use that shit
Chris,they made it so ugly
Chris,like soooo ugly
Chris,Insinuating that it wasn't already ugly
Chris,What did they change?
Chris,they removed the darker parts and just made everything the lighter version so now there's no more contrast and logical grouping of things that go together and everything just sorta blends together and looks awful
Chris,and I don't know why they thought it was an improvement
Chris,my best guess is they've just decided to drive the last holdouts over to dark theme and then delete light mode
Chris,OH ITS AWFUL

Chris,"Millennials, also known as Generation Y (or simply Gen Y), are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted definition. Millennials are sometimes referred to as ""echo boomers"" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The characteristics of millennials vary by region and by individual, and the group experiences a variety of social and economic conditions, but they are generally marked by their coming of age in the Information Age, and are comfortable in their usage of digital technologies and social media."

Chris,He's cool but he's no beghoul
Chris,
Chris,"bored between classes so I made a tier list, come give me shit for my shit opinions"
Chris,why does it only go to C tier
Chris,because the game's well enough balanced that it doesn't need to go further down
Chris,"I've seen games that don't go below B tier (shoutouts to UNIST, although technically it has Enkidu tier, containing just Enkidu, because he is terrible. Still got 5th at evo though.)"
Chris,I'll have my tier list out in a few days
Chris,So I will refrain from commenting for now
Chris,cloud needs to be lower
Chris,he's in b- tier
Chris,there's a reason why the 2 best cloud players are dropping cloud and why i'm taking a break from smash
Chris,"eeeh I don't think he's that low, but I might have put him a bit high. He's still got good tools and I feel like he mops up a solid chunk of the characters below him"
Chris,but there's just characters who are more or less better cloud
Chris,what tools? when all his moves have 0 priority and trade with almost anything
Chris,"they aren't that bad, and they're pretty safe, if not plus. Also he has solid juggling and deals hella damage, and always has a comeback/blowup factor because his callout tools (fsmash, anything with limit) are really strong"
Chris,UPAIR LOSES AND TRADES WITH BOWSER NAIR
Chris,FUCKING BOWSER NAIR
Chris,you can't tell me cloud has good shit
Chris,when i've played him the most
Chris,bowser nair is amazing what are you talking about
Chris,everything loses to bowser nair
Chris,barring insane disjoints
Chris,hense my point. cloud sucks
Chris,"which cloud doesn't have anymore, he only has moderate disjooints"
Chris,losing to something that almost everyone else also loses to does not make your character bad
Chris,^
Chris,Benson your point there made no sense
Chris,my point is that cloud's juggling game isnt great
Chris,he struggles to kill
Chris,and his disjoints suck
Chris,his moves have no priority
Chris,and his recovery is bad
Chris,I'd like to point out that everything you just mentioned except the recovery thing applies to the entire chunk immediately above him
Chris,"duck hunt,  the links, g&w, shulk"
Chris,shulk at least has decent disjoints but also his juggling sucks
Chris,and the poor boy can't kill without putting himself hugely at risk
Chris,he has smash art
Chris,at least that helps
Chris,"which puts him hugely at risk as well, it's terrible for closing out games or making comebacks"
Chris,also a great way to lose leads
Chris,"but yes, he's a better character than cloud, which is why he's near the top of the tier as opposed to the bottom"
Chris,cloud has a hard time dealing with people who constantly run away + sometimes can't kill until he lands a unstale move or throw at 220%
Chris,on top of that his grab sucks balls
Chris,yeah he's got issues
Chris,but so does everyone at this point in the list
Chris,"and he's able to safely poke with kill moves, which is a big deal"
Chris,unless it's perfectly spaced in which it only hits the shield and not aimed at the opponent then yes
Chris,but other than that
Chris,no
Chris,his bair is safe only if you spot dodge
Chris,and his fair loses to fast oos options
Chris,also parrying is a thing
Chris,which makes bair unsafe
Chris,which is his safest move
Chris,yeah but parrying makes... basically everything unsafe
Chris,so it's not a super valid issue
Chris,@Max @Sak von Sak @TheRainbowpixelz @The Rona anyone down for some smash
Chris,wanna play some ike
Chris,"got another lecture in 20 minutes, I'd be down after that tho"
Chris,just got back from class
Chris,so in like an hour and a half or so
Chris,i have class later 
Chris,at 5
Chris,also kameron come shit on my tier list
Chris,I'll play
Chris,your tier list trash
Chris,or join the argument about how I placed cloud
Chris,cloud sucks and is bottom of mid tier
Chris,"you put mega man, zss, chrom, ness, gren, pac, shulk way too low"
Chris,"I don't think zss deserves to be any higher imo, and the rest might be a bit better but I feel like results on them are all dropping off (except shulk)"
Chris,imagine thinking mega man and pac results are dropping off
Chris,I may have just not seen any
Chris,kameme won an s tier 
Chris,oh
Chris,solo mm?
Chris,p much
Chris,mostly megaman
Chris,hm might move him to like around pac then
Chris,bowser being above pac and mega man is a joke
Chris,megaman is better than bowser
Chris,not sure about pac
Chris,well :/ it depends  on the mu
Chris,they are not characters I know a ton about
Chris,it wasn't exactly an extensively researched tier list
Chris,most of megaman and pac is theory crafting
Chris,judging the megaman placing by japanese players at evo megaman and duck hunt have gone up in my tier lsit
Chris,but there's still not enough information via games to justify if they are actually good or not
Chris,"we'll see, my assumption is that like most not-super-popular characters that are being labbed out, there'll be a bunch of new tech found, their results will shoot up, then people will start figuring out the matchup and the results will drop a bit, but still be noticeably higher than initially"
Chris,"so it's hard to say at what point any characters like that are, especially if you're me and haven't even noticed the good results"
Chris,you've seen that duck hunt and how much safe pressure it can put out
Chris,with pac-man ive already seen people learn how to play around his neutral b galiga
Chris,we just have to wait and see more to fully get a grasp on these zoners

Chris,"and I'm like ""I've never had a pair of earbuds last more than like... six months"" so I pay the extra $5"

Chris,Vote Now! [Dig a ditch (in moderate weather)] [Do Research]
Chris,thoughts?
Chris,Melee might be more fun with only battlefield tbh
Chris,id be down to ban puff
Chris,That would be even better
Chris,Banning things to make the game more fun is perfectly fine in my opinion
Chris,Like TF2 6s does
Chris,tf2 6s wasnt really banning things
Chris,it was building a competitive game from the ground up
Chris,If heavy had GRU and his slowing minigun legal he would have seen play
Chris,it was a 'constructive ruleset'
Chris,"When hungrybox is in attendance, Ultimate top 8 probably has a faster average game speed. How depressing that one character can slow down an entire game."
Chris,Just ban Hungrybox
Chris,when he is maybe gonna lose he plays lame
Chris,
Chris,puff encourages non-interaction
Chris,Characters should not have multiple jumps
Chris,Meta knight had the same issue of air camping
Chris,air camping inherently limits the options of your opponent making it bad to approach
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,What does that mean
Chris,It was listing his most common moves for neutral wins and kills.
Chris,@Mr. Airplane do you not want to do research?
Chris,dreamland is basically impossible for marth vs puff cause pivot tipper doesnt kill until the percents dont work anymore
Chris,It connects and kills during an 8% window

Chris,If its in inches i'm out
Chris,"It depends on what the fitness challenge is. Maybe its ""Who can achieve the highest proportional increase in weight lifting"" or ""Who can keep the highest average heart rate over the month??"" IDK

I know the bois are tryna get fit. Way easier to achieve when you gamify it and do it with friends"

Chris,this is some wack gamer mouse design
Chris,but it's apparently a crazy good mouse and only $50
Chris,p sure its to reduce weight by using less material
Chris,could be wrong tho
Chris,yeah
Chris,but it looks so gamer
Chris,I bought it
Chris,(current mouse is dying)
Chris,which is weird cause my mouse i can put extra weights in to make ti heavier
Chris,which i do
Chris,I actually like lighter mice
Chris,doesn't have the same heft but also it just feels super free and easy
Chris,idk for me it feels like i can be more accurate with a heavier mouse
Chris,prob cause im adjusted to it now tho
Chris,also I do a lot of my mousing with my fingers and wrist rather than my arm
Chris,so light is a lot easier
Chris,I say as i just overshot a program on my taskbar and opened steam
Chris,lol

Chris,Okay the ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion is wack
Chris,
Chris,Are you talking about the TV series or the movie?
Chris,Theres a movie?
Chris,:0
Chris,Im talking about the TV series
Chris,"There is a movie ""End of Evangelion"""
Chris,That fixes the ending
Chris,FR???
Chris,yes
Chris,THANK GOD
Chris,I was kind of dissatisfied 
Chris,you should still watch the zero budget TV series end though because its funny
Chris,Thanks for letting me know buddy
Chris,It was really zero budget?
Chris,no
Chris,I thought this was supposed to be intentionally artsy
Chris,but they did have some problems
Chris,it was not meant to be like this
Chris,Thats good to know
Chris,yeah they flat out ran out of money
Chris,oof
Chris,which is hilarious to me since it ended up being one of the most profitable anime franchises ever
Chris,just... not during production
Chris,it's weird how iconic that show is
Chris,like I bet if you played the theme song
Chris,most people would recognize it and go
Chris,hmmm I know this song but not where it is from
Chris,"There is a video called something like ""Can you live entirely off Evangelion Merchandise?"". There is so much of it that you basically can."
Chris,spoilers
Chris,I'm reading online
Chris,"and people are saying ""They ran out of money"" is a myth"
Chris,can someone source this please?
Chris,They had problems with the original ending being too similar to a terrorist attack and thought it would be in poor taste to release it is the long answer.
Chris,"honestly it's not that weird that the show ended up being as iconic as it was, at least within anime. It kinda revolutionized an entire genre and brought a ton of new ideas and directions into the medium and is a huge part of why anime is the way it is, but despite that no one's quite managed to replicate what made it work. The weird thing is that it's so recognizable to people who don't know much of anything about anime"
Chris,facts
Chris,"I didn't know what the show was until gigukk made the ""Basically, Netflix's Evangelion"""
Chris,But before seeing that I had inadvertently seen tons of references to the show around the internet
Chris,It was a good watch
Chris,Time for the film
Chris,dayum I've got the ESL new york finals in the background and apparently EG just beat Astralis 16-3 on Astralis' pick?
Chris,let's go NA
Chris,"Honestly, I didn't even know EG had a CSGO team."
Chris,they bought NRG's roster
Chris,"like, a week ago"
Chris,I only know about it because they keep mentioning it on commentary

Chris,@Ultimate ?
Chris,There's a common concept that to be really good at something you first have to suck at it and fail a bunch
Chris,However usually people who end up really good at something start fairly good at the thing
Chris,Yes
Chris,So it's a dumb and ultimately harmful concept
Chris,You are only getting half of that right
Chris,"Your ability to master any skill is pretty much directly related to your IQ. 

Two dudes start learning a game for instance. Jim's IQ is 130 while Bob's is 100. 

If they both practice 8 hours a day, by the end of the month Jim is pretty much guaranteed to be way better than Bob. 

When they started they both sucked and failed to play the game well. What differentiates them is the Jim was able to learn and reduce his failures/attempts WAY faster than Bob."
Chris,TLRD: To be good at something you do have to fail... BUT your number of failures will be vastly lower than someone with a lower IQ and you will master the skill quicker.
Chris,Okay get the fuck out of here. You did not just start typing the MOMENT I open discord @Mr. Airplane
Chris,
Chris,MonkaW
Chris,
Chris,I am watching you
Chris,I mean uh
Chris,D:
Chris,monkaS
Chris,@Trapezoider so because I picked up melee quicker than you I have a higher iq right?
Chris,jed actual 
Chris,Yes
Chris,@Jed
Chris,Apparently reaction time is indicative of higher IQ as well
Chris,I wouldn't be surprised if you have more brain points
Chris,Oh wack
Chris,
Chris,Alright everyone. I have returned to my name
Chris,But the Baron...
Chris,How will he sruvive without his assistant
Chris,The Baron is on vacation in Fiji
Chris,Ah understandable
Chris,lmao I'm boutta go skydiving
Chris,try not to die
Chris,I will
Chris,Skydiving is idiotic in my opinion
Chris,Why
Chris,cause I was like hey what if I went skydiving
Chris,It's probably safer than driving a car
Chris,oh
Chris,Not you
Chris,lmao yeah I said that to my mom
Chris,I mean is true
Chris,Just cause something seems scary
Chris,Doesn't mean it is scary
Chris,I feel like you should do things you think are scary
Chris,/dangerous
Chris,Yeah Mrs.Max is afraid of flying even though its statistically safer than driving
Chris,He means my Mom ^

Chris,I've never had an open book test
Chris,Is that normal?
Chris,depends
Chris,it's fairly common in courses like this one where there's a ton of formulas to memorize that aren't as important as actually knowing how to apply them
Chris,zack stop messaging us

Chris,
Chris,oh wow that looks really complicated and professsional
Chris,yeah
Chris,he's mad talented
Chris,and also just works really hard
Chris,yep hard work and a lotta time dedication can get you pretty far
Chris,but you also have to be smart about it. I spent years making super slow progress because I was really stupid about how I was going about drawing
Chris,Yeah but I mean for really skilled artists like me our talents just develope naturally
Chris,I guess that's just absolute savants

Chris,"So as many of you know I've started a new campaign and for this one i wanted to have an introduction so that there could something in between starting situation and when the players actually started to play. When i was going about writing this i said to myself it would really suck if i were to fuck this up when i have to read it so why not just record it and play it for the players over some music. I decided ultimately to not do that and it went perfectly fine but while i did not put into practice my recording idea i did however record 30 clips of me trying to record this introduction and on all of the 29 clips i failed. I ended up getting pretty mad the last one in this video was perfect, but all the rest are just me raging so i asked some people if they wanted to see it and they said they did so here for your enjoyment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YFx7qlhq0&feature=youtu.be"

Chris,so do you just sit there
Chris,yes sir
Chris,i wouldnt do it for more than like a week then

Chris,actually awful recovery
Chris,m2k beat hbox
Chris,hype
Chris,Plup beat Salem lololol
Chris,he took game 1 vs tweek
Chris,ohhh
Chris,Is it on stream?
Chris,no
Chris,he lost 3-1 lol
Chris,plup and armada both placed 17th
Chris,mew2king really is the coolest marth
Chris,Did leo not got to big house
Chris,no
Chris,Melee saved
Chris,Praise almighty Mang0
Chris,Zain is so good what the heck
Chris,that girl sceaming in the background fucked over leffen
Chris,i would be hella tilted
Chris,That's the mang0
Chris,Long live melee
Chris,
Chris,Yes
Chris,ay I broke my 9th place ultimate curse
Chris,by getting 13th
Chris,still counts
Chris,I was about to type a congratulatory message...
Chris,(also in all fairness this was a monthly with a bunch of out-of-town people)
Chris,(so there were like twenty more people than usual)
Chris,King's Court?
Chris,yeah
Chris,Big House melee was great to watch because Hbox got eliminated early
Chris,"I did maintain my UNIST 2nd place curse though, so I got $5"
Chris,which failed to cover the $17 I spent on entering four tournaments
Chris,also yeah I'm sad I missed top 8
Chris,from looking at the bracket it looks nuts
Chris,What other two did you enter?
Chris,"melee singles, ult singles, ult dubs, unist"
Chris,"also tekken, which was free"
Chris,game is wack
Chris,"""So I jump into the air, you see? and then I fly down at you?""
""Yeah.""
""It's an overhead. But technically it's unblockable. But it can be blocked low."""
Chris,???
Chris,ayo what
Chris,zackray's playing corrin
Chris,he lost
Chris,yeah he got pretty booped
Chris,but not much more on corrin than on joker
Chris,nairo's playing DK what is this tournament
Chris,Zackray in summit
Chris,Game and Watch looks super annoying to play against
Chris,Up B and his smash attacks are so spammable
Chris,And up air
Chris,alright boys
Chris,Im hype
Chris,I just spent an hour
Chris,Trying to find a copy of this textbook that is $300

Chris,
Chris,Uhh
Chris,My game is fucked
Chris,Guys is it just me or are kamerons drawings getting better? 
Chris,how dare you. Kameron's art is already at peak perfection. It cannot ascend any higher.
Chris,Honestly
Chris,every time kameron draws the bar for perfection simply moves up

Chris,Dolphin Emulator 2019.10.08 - 00.34.37.03.DVR Trim
Chris,oh hey indivisible came out today
Chris,must... finish.... assignment... first
Chris,"bleh I'm strongly considering just not handing in this assignment. It's only worth ~6% of my mark, and as far as I've been able to tell I'm following the instructions to a T and it's not working (so I assume I'm misunderstanding something, but I have no idea what). Went for office hours and the TA just never showed up. I could go in for a different TA's office hours tomorrow (it's due tonight so I'd be taking late marks but I'd still get most of the grades), but with all the other stuff I have on my plate I honestly think it might not be worth it."
Chris,That sucks dude
Chris,this course is such a nightmare
Chris,What class is this?
Chris,neural nets
Chris,the content is really interesting
Chris,but the prof sucks
Chris,and 2/3 TAs suck
Chris,"and the lecture slides suck, and the assignments are missing like half the information you'd need to do the assignment, and there's zero feedback on anything"
Chris,every time this year you've seen me complain about a course it's been this one
Chris,Is there a department head that you could talk to about this?
Chris,This honestly sounds really annoying
Chris,"probably, but they're notoriously backed up one everything"
Chris,@Ultimate yall wanna do some fun ultimate thing later
Chris,like a character crew battle?
Chris,I'd be down if I can get all my stuff done
Chris,that's why im working rn

Chris,Do you understand implicit differentiation?
Chris,"I don't remember what implicit differentiation is, but I know how I'd solve this normally"
Chris,Mostly
Chris,so I dunno how much help I'll be
Chris,I can help

Chris,Uhhhhh
Chris,Please tell me whippets are something else in canada
Chris,Isn't that a drug?
Chris,lol no
Chris,It's nitrous oxide in canisters and you huff it
Chris,But I assume it's something else
Chris,Unless Canada has some lit grocery stores
Chris,
Chris,Ah
Chris,I see
Chris,they are very addicting though
Chris,but usually more expensive than I would pay for
Chris,but it was 2 boxes for $5 as opposed to one box for $3.50
Chris,oh i thought whippets were dogs
Chris,they are that as well
Chris,two boxes of dogs for $5 would be pretty amazing
Chris,although that'd be a lot of dogs to take care of
Chris,but I could probably sell them at a reasonable markup
Chris,i wonder how many dogs comes in one box
Chris,@Ultimate anyone downs?
Chris,thats a little personal of a question dont ya think

Chris,I should get one
Chris,I just need a way to set up a push to talk that I can use while playing a game with a controller. My current thought is some kind of foot pedal.
Chris,Just use a button on the controller
Chris,
Chris,^
Chris,I don't have any free buttons on my GC controller that would be convenient to press while playing

Chris,well i had one fun game and then played a laggy rob on fd so i guess im done
Chris,you fought the spirit of my frustration at this neural nets assignment
Chris,yoshi link might be 100 0
Chris,that matchup feels very impossible
Chris,@Trapezoider @The Rona Rocket launched
Chris,"Congrats, you have gotten farther than both me and Andrew"
Chris,aight ya boi went on a run today https://kingstonsmash.challonge.com/KU39
Chris,Kingston Smash Ultimate 2019 - Weekly #39 - Challonge
Chris,"(also got 7th in melee, was one stock away from beating #3 in the city too but then I choked, and continued my unbroken string of 2nd places in unist, although I took a game off the best player in the city this time)"
Chris,Nice losers run
Chris,thanks :)
Chris,I played such a weird mix of characters
Chris,but like 2/3 incineroar and it worked really well
Chris,I made one guy soooo mad and ended up getting my first PR win for the season
Chris,"he won game 1, I took game 2, then he swapped off his main (dedede) for roy which was hilarious cause of all those incineroar-roy games I played against max where I learned to cheese the poor boy (runoff lariat), then he pulled a PT and I showed him why you don't try to zone out incineroar"
Chris,I feel bad for him. Incineroar would be in gouge eyes out tier of my annoying tier list.
Chris,yeah a little bit
Chris,I played some Bowser today
Chris,oh no
Chris,man is easy
Chris,are we gonna have three
Chris,no
Chris,yeah he's pretty straight forward
Chris,I just wanted to prove a point
Chris,have I ever pretended like he's not easy?
Chris,That wasn't the point. I was proving that he is good.
Chris,I always thought he was pretty good too?
Chris,he's at worst upper mid tier
Chris,These points were not directed at you
Chris,fair
Chris,I learned some new ledge trapping tricks with Palu as well in my session today against Benson.
Chris,I also finally hit this one unist combo in a real match for once
Chris,the one and only time I get to feel like mika actually has good damage
Chris,"costs half my meter as a starter though, and the other half as the ender, but it does like 50% of most characters health"
Chris,"was also the first time I didn't feel totally outmatched against harley (he did still 3-1 3-0 me between winner's and grand finals, but most of the games were really close)"
Chris,Have you lost to him for every 2nd place finish?
Chris,"naw, the weeks he wasn't there I lost to different people -_-"
Chris,but he is responsible for most of them
Chris,ay I just found that discord has a setting that puts light theme pretty much back to how it used to be
Chris,it's not quite as good but now I have a better alternative to dark mode so I'm going for it
Chris,dark sidebar pog
Chris,yup
Chris,although the old light theme had a lighter grey for the sidebar
Chris,it also had a darker bit for the users sidebar
Chris,but it's still better than all dark
Chris,but new light theme kinda nice tho

Chris,"You can talk about the importance of participating in a democracy. Cite low voter turnout percentages, and encourage voting in the next election."
Chris,yeah but im pretty sure that the person right before me is doing that already
Chris,the environment one
Chris,oh snap voting could be good
Chris,except that i dont do it
Chris,Do they know that though

Chris,i am watching stuff
Chris,"weekly summary:
7th in melee, lost to 1st and 2nd place, had pretty close sets against both of em (last stock game 3 with 2nd, two last hit games with 1st)

5th in ultimate, lost to 1st and 4th. Got bodied by the guy who won, game 5 last hit with the 4th place guy (who I kinda sorta hate as a human being and he said he'd quit if he ever lost to incineroar, so I'm real sad about that)

2nd in unist as always, but probably featured the ""highlight"" of the weekly, where between the last game of winner's finals and first two games of grands, I landed one hit. In those three games (six rounds) I was perfected 5 times. I have never been so completely destroyed in any game ever. Not playing melee against Ryan Ford or Moky, or ringing for plat 6s when I was in steel. Holy fuck I got completely and utterly shredded."
Chris,I also ate an excellent burrito that was far beyond my capacity for spiciness but it was so damn good that I kept taking these huge bites and then dying for the next five minutes then being really excited to take another bite
Chris,My younger self resonates with this so much

Chris,                                                                                                                              
Chris,
Chris,Man imagine playing  cowboi game when you arent even american
Chris,smfh
Chris,Game fun as fuck though
Chris,imagine buying rdr2 twice
Chris,literally spending 120 dollars on a video game
Chris,Literally didn't buy it the first time
Chris,My dad bought it for himself
Chris,I just mooched
Chris,Kameron out here thinking we pay 120 dollars for 2 video games
Chris,
Chris,TRUE
Chris,not in canadian schmeckles my friend
Chris,my b i meant 400 chuck e cheese coupons
Chris,^
Chris,there you go
Chris,@Trapezoider where'd you find my dpotg vods?
Chris,@Cs:go any1?
Chris,Youtub
Chris,Can yousend me the link I couldn't find it
Chris,@Cs:go
Chris,need a fifth
Chris,Someone just sent me a pic on Snapchat of them holding a pumpkin spiced latte and saying “still holding onto those fall vibes”
Chris,Like ofc you are it’s still fall you dumb bitch
Chris,"I think theyre saying that the ""fall vibes"" have become tangible through the latte that theyve had for a while"
Chris,kinda deep if you think about it
Chris,Ok push guy
Chris,Ok now I go this way
Chris,People in r/smashbros don't understand how balance work
Chris,Actually neither do blizzard tbh
Chris,Whenever you talk about the general public
Chris,They generally have no idea how to balance a game
Chris,you aren't supposed to buff bad character's weakness or nerf good character's strengths
Chris,you buff bad character's inherent strengths and nerf good characters inherent weaknesses
Chris,that keeps characters different and interesting
Chris,like people on r/smashbros are saying to buff incineroar's speed
Chris,but that would not make any sense with how incineroar works as a character
Chris,he's slow because his moves are really good and cover a lot of space
Chris,same as people who wanted to nerf roadhog's hook but make him more tanky
Chris,the tradeoff for roadhog was that he can have a high burst damage output but you risk dieing and feeding ult charge
Chris,oh god fast incineroar would be horrifying
Chris,but hurr durr he a tank he shouldnt do damage but he should have damage resistances like every other tank that already exists but have more utility than hog when you remove his hook's usefullness
Chris,also yea fast incineroar would be stupid
Chris,just let PT play as any three pokemon
Chris,he'd just be better bowser
Chris,why would you want that r/smashbros
Chris,not pt incin
Chris,becasue r/smashbros is not a particularly smart environment
Chris,but like these are core concepts of game balance
Chris,also that was a suggestion for a different dumb change
Chris,it would be funny
Chris,like preschooler level stuff
Chris,but also wack as fuck
Chris,yeah
Chris,you only nerf a strong character's strengths if you didn't actually mean to make it a strength/overdid it
Chris,you dont remove characters weaknesses when they bad or every char is gonna feel the same
Chris,^
Chris,true
Chris,like it's good that sm4sh took out diddy down throw up air up air up air
Chris,and made bayo stuff less consistent (for all the good that did)
Chris,like the only change I would make to pika is make him bigger or make his moves do less damage
Chris,but in general if you take away both strengths and weaknesses you end up with a bland cast
Chris,because fast safe moves and an insane recover are supposed to be pika's strengths
Chris,imo I'd make him upb on stage more punishable
Chris,but being small and doing a lot of damage are not
Chris,it's kind of a dumb neutral tool
Chris,yea mayb
Chris,but that would fall into your thing of a strength being too strong
Chris,like joker for example is a fundementally broken char
Chris,"but yeah his whole point is that he's small, fast, and has high-execution stuff that's really good"
Chris,because his strengths and weaknesses do not adhere to the design of the game
Chris,yeah he's a weird one
Chris,I can't really think of a good way to fix him without totally redesigning him as a character
Chris,so he should be changed entirely imo
Chris,also some parts of his kit are just crazy overtuned
Chris,like down gun
Chris,I mean really you just gotta change how arsene and down gun work
Chris,and side b doing like 17
Chris,and his arsene moves having hitboxes the size of bowser
Chris,but yea arsene coming from taking damage makes no sense
Chris,and hitting him with arsene should make it go away very quickly
Chris,"I'd say just make it so that if he eats a certain number of attacks he just loses arsense automatically, so if you hit him with like four moves (not four hits, four moves) he's back to normal"
Chris,or just like
Chris,yea
Chris,make him more in line with the game he's from
Chris,and just have arsene for his specials
Chris,and his normals are his normals
Chris,or maybe 25 damage and arsene goes away
Chris,he'd still be really good but not as dumb
Chris,but he gets arsene by dealing 30 damage
Chris,or make it time based idk
Chris,or go the p4a route of if you hit him with arsene out enough times he just has no arsene for the whole stock
Chris,meh characters changing based on stock stuff like that is kinda dumb imo
Chris,eh maybe
Chris,like lucario
Chris,or krool
Chris,krool?
Chris,his belly can break
Chris,oh right
Chris,or wonderwing
Chris,but banjo is just lame tho
Chris,also I gotta say I hate that arsene is such a bad mechanic because the visual design for arsene is so damn cool
Chris,but in smash it's such an anti-fun mechanic
Chris,and also you can barely see him
Chris,it really be tho
Chris,zack why dont you play joker
Chris,cause he's not all that fun imo
Chris,I don't like having to rely on arsene or tricky setups for my kills
Chris,I really wanted to like him
Chris,Only big losers play joker
Chris,Wrong
Chris,Only big winners play joker
Chris,Also
Chris,Only cuties
Chris,
Chris,whens kameron 5
Chris,soon
Chris,brother
Chris,"Zack: 15
Kameron: 8"
Chris,@SWIRL GIRL @Bitmin @Mr. Airplane csgo
Chris,yes
Chris,10 minutes
Chris,then me and matt play
Chris,@Cs:go need 1 more
Chris,i can come in 10
Chris,Paradise Lost might be up there as one of the works books I've ever been forced to read
Chris,By Milton?
Chris,No the other paradise lost
Chris,They buffed incineroar's neutral b a bunch 
Chris,Spin move time
Chris,Spin move!
Chris,patch notes?
Chris,also WHY did they buff incineroar neutral b
Chris,move's already mad good
Chris,Also Terry is out already
Chris,We play later tonight lads @Ultimate
Chris,Time to pick up another character
Chris,lol they buffed incineroar neutral b... third hit
Chris,just specifically the third hit
Chris,of like five
Chris,They buffed the rest of the move too keep reading
Chris,(oh wait that was jabs I'm dumb)
Chris,that is a big yikes
Chris,and revenge lasts longer and has less end lag
Chris,fair got a bit nerfed though? hard to tell
Chris,either they added a weak hitbox or they really extended the weak hitbox I can't tell
Chris,Terry appearantly is kinda nice
Chris,No Palu nerfs
Chris,I'm satisfied
Chris,I'm definitely a little upset they buffed Incineroar though
Chris,I mean he doesn't have any new goofy stuff
Chris,just some of his old goofy stuff is better
Chris,I still don't think it's enough for me to solo main him
Chris,"(also, probably won't immediately be joining ultimate stuff tonight, some of my housemates who play traditional fighters want to learn, and also I'm gonna be learning some soul caliber, so I probably won't be around until pretty late)"
Chris,I have a test tomorrow so I will be trying Terry offline for like 5 minutes but won't be here to play online games.
Chris,
Chris,just study now and we can play later
Chris,I have to go to class now
Chris,I just woke up
Chris,
Chris,oh dear terry has double quarter circle inputs
Chris,and also what appears to be ghetto qc back half circle forwards
Chris,this is what we get for KoF characters
Chris,Kinda hype for Terry not gonna lie
Chris,@Ultimate fite me
Chris,I'll play for 30 minutes

Chris,ill play but gonna bathroom first
Chris,"""Let's say you want to play poker. Let's say, hypothetically, you want to get a group of friends and play poker. Ok, and if you did play with friends, you would want to play with the homies right? Then hypothetically speaking, there would be a frostbite poker night. Now, let's say its tonight.

Now that we have established that there will be a poker night and the homies are invited, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that it would be fun. Am I not correct? A group of the homies deserves poker night, so I suggest that we play poker."""

Chris,I had such a lucky bracket lol
Chris,able dq'd?
Chris,"able DQ'd, and while I've brought him to last hit both times I've fought him he's always won, then Lungs upset Boo who I probably would have lost to again"
Chris,and then dog was playing luigi instead of his usual sheik
Chris,and his usual sheik fucks me up
Chris,made $10.50 from a $2 entry fee
Chris,did not cover the cost of entering two brackets and buying a giant burrito

Chris,
Chris,
Chris,"Got 33rd (3-2) at an ultimate regional, which I'm okay with given that both players I lost to finished 7th. I couldn't plausibly have done better given my seeding and I feel like I played pretty well. Also I made another campy player really mad about Incineroar which is always nice. Didn't even need revenge, just knowing that a) dash attack picks up banana and you're diddy so I don't care about the tiny punish you might get from that, b) while holding banana I still have access to sideb, lariat, and upb, and c) banana -> sideb is a thing Incineroar can do."

Chris,Good one
Chris,"“I don’t think I’ll have kids”
- Boring
- Invites argument

“My bloodline dies with me”
- Assertive
- Metal as fuck
- Implies you’re taking on a great noble burden which allows no arguments"
Chris,ty devon very cool
Chris,Me and Joan were discussing antinatalism and my 7 month pregnant boss walked in
Chris,I’ll keep y’all posted if I still have a job next week
Chris,Antinatalism is super toxic
Chris,It's up there with the death acceptance movement as one of my least favorite philosophical positions.
Chris,"Holdup why is the death acceptance movement one of your least favourite positions, I’m genuinely trying to find anything somebody could object to about it"
Chris,I have no idea why anyone would want to die given the alternative.
Chris,Suffering?
Chris,Eternal life is the ultimate goal of all medical research. Death and aging cause so much suffering that to end it would be a triumph unparalleled for all time.
Chris,Death acceptance is not a debate on medical suicide if that's what you were thinking
Chris,It means opposing eternal life
Chris,If that’s your stance then I don’t see how you can be antinatalism if you think living forever is the end goal then obv once we can live forever we need to stop having kids
Chris,No
Chris,We need to expand to other planets
Chris,So I understand the death acceptance movement and given the opportunity to have eternal life I would decline
Chris,There’s no point in living without dying imo
Chris,That is so contrary to my own belief I cannot comprehend why anyone would ever think that.
Chris,Eternal life is cool but if eternal life means an eternity of floating in the middle of space aimlessly while i lose my mind id rather not
Chris,"Would you ask the grim reaper to bring you blindness, weakness, ugliness, and an end to your relatives and yourself if he were a real entity. Why not just ask for nothing and lead a more enjoyable existence."
Chris,Eternal life doesn't mean you literally exist until the end of the universe
Chris,@Rotomotorz
Chris,"Watch CGP Grey's video ""why die"" for a great overview of my position"
Chris,?
Chris,Floating in the middle of space aimlessly
Chris,i.e.
Chris,just you floating in space
Chris,no ground for you to stand on
Chris,no like in a shuttle
Chris,not literally just you
Chris,The concept of one day you will die gives life more purpose and meaning IMO
Chris,"Also  @Max , does your idea of eternal life also include eternal youth?"
Chris,Yes of course. The research of the two go hand in hand.
Chris,"Okay, that's what I thought"
Chris,One will be a natural result of the other
Chris,But I wanted to make sure
Chris,"Also @Eric Working From Home , you will still eventually die"
Chris,In your uptown world is capitalism abolished or are human wage slaves for eternity
Chris,It's just about delaying that for as long as possible
Chris,Would you beat your child to make the days you don't beat him more enjoyable?
Chris,Utopian**
Chris,@Max that is so far from the point it’s mind boggling
Chris,Death giving life meaning is analogous to what I said
Chris,wait yeah thats definitely not analogous
Chris,I mean it bigly ain’t
Chris,If you think so then you don't understand my position
Chris,The concept of dying means your days are numbered and gives motivation to enjoy you days as you can
Chris,If you could live forever you’d have no motivation to accomplish anything
Chris,Maybe if you are lazy
Chris,I think it would lead to even greater progress since humans would never have to reset their knowledge pool
Chris,what gives people motivation during endless life
Chris,tho
Chris,Life is meaning in itself
Chris,I guess if you don't share that position none of my others make any sense
Chris,I have to go to class now
Chris,Perhaps but what do you plan to do with the people who view otherwise
Chris,Let them die obviously
Chris,so then endless life is a choice?
Chris,Why wouldn't it be
Chris,or is it given to only select individuals
Chris,And if its a choice what do you do with those of no ambition that choose to live forever
Chris,Not many people instictively wabt to die
Chris,People should have the option of death should they choose
Chris,I can consent to dying I couldn’t consent to being born
Chris,Like what if everybody all stopped having kids and humanity just lived in this utopian society until we all eventually died out and then the earth can try again in 1000000 years once primates evolve to our level
Chris,That’s the dream right there baby
Chris,Why would we not want ourselves to evolve?
Chris,Why would we want to end as homo sapiens?
Chris,When we could become homo superior?
Chris,What you propose is literally the opposite of what life tries to do
Chris,Life doesn’t take ethics and morality into account
Chris,Life doesn’t care if it’s ethically and morally wrong to have a child
Chris,I don't think it needs to
Chris,It just wants you to procreate and die
Chris,It supercedes all things
Chris,ethics and morality are mere concepts that we as humans have come up with
Chris,Life is a concept not an entity
Chris,Aren’t ethics and morality what we view and making us different and superior to non sentient races
Chris,Living != surviving
Chris,Life doesn't need to be an entity to supercede other concepts
Chris,If you are of the opinion that we should be slaves to the machinations of life then why oppose death
Chris,One merely exists because of the other
Chris,I also don't understand how procreation would be ethically or morally wrong
Chris,"A child can’t consent to being born, a child is burdened by the implications of society without being given a choose and inversely society is burdened by another person to cause damage to others and the world"
Chris,If you want a kid then adopt one
Chris,"There’s only three reasons to birth a child: ignorance, narcissism or both."
Chris,"That is a pretty narrow statement though, don't you think?"
Chris,What about that is narrow
Chris,Just because something cannot consent to being born doesn't mean that it is unhappy because it was
Chris,Also
Chris,It only takes into account the morality and ethics side of life
Chris,"We don’t owe life, it will persist regardless of our actions so why should we slave to it"
Chris,Why shouldn't I owe life? It allows me to exist and be who I am today. Passing on my own genes doesn't mean that I am a slave to life
Chris,So you want to have children to pass on your genes
Chris,It also gives others the chance to experience what life has to offer
Chris,I realize that this could be interpreted as your both statement
Chris,but so what?
Chris,Why don’t we just agree to disagree then cause it seems we are at an impasse
Chris,
Chris,This is 100% topic
Chris,But
Chris,I just got my schedule for next term
Chris,"and again, I only got 3 of the classes that I enrolled for"
Chris,Bruh hunt down the guy making the schedules
Chris,That’s bogus
Chris,So I went to look at all the class schedules
Chris,To see what was causing the conflict
Chris,and
Chris,There isn't any
Chris,There is literally no conflict
Chris,I didn't get put into these classes for reasons unknown
Chris,These classes are still open by the way
Chris,And they are also only available during winter

Chris,"also, at the tourney today we ran doubles, I ended up teaming in melee with a guy who's not all that good (generally goes 1-2 or 2-2, has no PR wins for the season) on the semi-arbitrary recommendation of dayman and we ended up going pretty hard - beat a team of #3 in the city and a guy around my level, and we were the only team to take a game off the team that won

we placed third, which doesn't seem all that impressive given that there were only 5 teams, but we crushed a team with players around the same levels, and beat a team we had absolutely no right to even get a game from"
Chris,@Homies quick bitta games or naw
Chris,we had shockingly good synergy
Chris,and I feel like if we practice we'll be an actual serious dubs threat
Chris,Aw fuck mate I’d love for a spot of games ping me if ya end up playing a not smash or csgo game

Chris,"December 1st, the snows have begun. I was outside for like ten minutes and the footprints I left on my way out of the house had vanished by the time I came back. This was a few minutes after I came back in and there was still snow in my hair that hadn't melted"
Chris,snow 
Chris,i hate snow
Chris,it is -15 and hella windy
Chris,yesterday there was no snow
Chris,would anybody like to engage in a board or card game
Chris,@Sak von Sak you just got snow shits been like this for me for like a good month now

apparently, if you're married and happen to catch a glimse of another women out of the corner of your eye, and think to yourself ""damn she's kinda hot"", you should rip that eye out."
Chris,Is this the old or new testament?
Chris,new
Chris,also the whole chunk that part is from is basically throwing shade at jews
Chris,"which is really funny because it frequently calls them hypocrites but I sure haven't heard of anyone, no matter how devout, tear out an eye because they saw someone attractive"
Chris,Yo but if every dude alive nutted at the same time
Chris,what would happen?
Chris,
Chris,A lot of teachers would be fired
Chris,no but like
Chris,if all dudes were on a rocket ship
Chris,and were facing dick down
Chris,could the nutt blast get you to orbit?
Chris,OR better yet
Chris,If they were facing dick up
Chris,Could they de orbit earth? 
Chris,unlikely
Chris,since each man's nut would have to propel their own body weight
Chris,and adding more people would just make that less efficient
Chris,anyone wanna @Cs:go @Mr. Airplane @waowder @Sak von Sak @Matt

Chris,I'm probably gonna play through before the storm then do life is strange again and then do the 2nd
Chris,Man now I'm excited for the last episode but I have an essay to write
Chris,wanna trade essays
Chris,and then neither of us do them and instead we play life is strange together?

Chris,my statuses were just my name and numbers
Chris,"A closed room is a concept used in mystery fiction. An example would be a room with a corpse and the only key to that room in the pocket of the dead person, giving the impression that the crime was not possible to commit."
Chris,I've been reading mystery fiction for the last few months and closed rooms have come up a lot.
Chris,I'm gonna bother you to play danganronpa again
Chris,I'll get to it later
Chris,Does Danganronpa have closed rooms?

Chris,you can't dodge closed rooms
Chris,stfu i was planning on playing them soon
Chris,ruining everything
Chris,look my dude
Chris,STFU
Chris,saying there's a lot of murder in danganronpa is like saying there's a lot of cowboys in red dead redemption
Chris,it's literally the premise
Chris,LOL
Chris,you're reminding me i need to play it too
Chris,wonder if i can pirate it somehow 
Chris,I can literally send you the rom
Chris,right now
Chris,woa h
Chris,i feel bad pirating games tho
Chris,i should just buy it
Chris,aight here's what I'd say
Chris,if you're not sure if you're gonna like it
Chris,"pirate it, play the first two trials then make up your mind"
Chris,"and then you can decide to stop, or buy it, or do what I did and finish the first game but buy the other two"

Chris,the only two important channels should be next to eachother

Chris,quotes - 6 characters
Chris,memes - 5 characters
Chris,memes > quotes

Chris,"Weeb: Enhanced sense of ""culture"" often takes things with satire and loves to shittalk.
Otaku: Owns various amounts of merchandise and can be very loyal to one or more of his waifus
One person can be both a weeb and otaku but there is a diffrence between a real otaku and a fake one"
Chris,@Zain
Chris,
Chris,"yeah except that literally no one cares and we all just call ourselves and each other ""weebs"""
Chris,also those aren't even the true definitions but go off ig
Chris,they arn't deffinitions
Chris,just my way of interoperting the differance
Chris,where did you even get that from???
Chris,i've never heard it described like that in my life
Chris,"weebs tend to be more of an ""american style"" shitpost version of otaku"
Chris,meanwhile otakus originate from the mainland itself
Chris,and dont really have that satire
Chris,?????
Chris,bruh
Chris,i ain't heard the word otaku in YEARS
Chris,idk where you're getting your info from
Chris,Gigguk
Chris,he said that?
Chris,weeb and otaku are interchangeable words
Chris,but there is a diffrence in which one is called
Chris,and percived
Chris,"that's why i said ""but there is a diffrence between a real otaku and a fake one"""

Chris,"Enjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube."

Chris,
Chris,^
Chris,saying youre an otaku is tbh more cringe than saying you're a weeb
Chris,cause atleast you arent in denail if you admit to being a weeb
Chris,there's a real dictionary deffiniton of otaku and not weeb
Chris,Well i just tried to kill myself
Chris,i'm genuinely unsure if you guys know the difference.
Chris,if you use a non english term to describe how much of an anime fan you are then you're a weeb
Chris,"weeb, ottaku who cards they both cringe"
Chris,you're all gay
Chris,problem solved
Chris,
Chris,^
Chris,so basically according to that video: Otakus don't exist in the west
Chris,checkmate
Chris,the weeb vs weeaboo thing seems to be true
Chris,"basically otaku is just a cringe-y, outdated term that people in the west don't really say anymore"
Chris,literally no one cares
Chris,im just saying rainbowpixel is wrONG
Chris,and im the more cultured weeb here
Chris,
Chris,Seems to fit
Chris,no ?
Chris,I mean what you just said now
Chris,compare your message with his definition
Chris,i never defined weeb
Chris,"all it means is someone who likes anime, that's literally it"
Chris,"""I'm the more cultured weeb here"" is what I was referring to"
Chris,don't you guys live in the same house?
Chris,IT WAS A JOKE SDKLFJSLDKJF

Chris,I'm gonna replay them all leading up to launch day
Chris,"I will hopefully be able to do that as well. Its doubtful that I'll have the time though, since I will be taking calc 2 when it comes out. My math professors have said to not expect much free time when taking calc 2."
Chris,I've looked over some of the stuff for integration
Chris,It seems conceptually easier than differential
Chris,That is so wrong
Chris,"But the ""shutup and calculate"" bits seem hard"
Chris,
Chris,Taking derivatives is pretty easy once you understand all the rules
Chris,@The Rona
Chris,Is my second comment correct?
Chris,I mean
Chris,It's just plug and chug really
Chris,But the equations can get complicated
Chris,so you have to be careful
Chris,What do you mean by shutup and calculate?
Chris,Definite integrals
Chris,You mean using the fundamental theorem?
Chris,I don't think so
Chris,Definite integrals are the ones where you have limits of integration right?
Chris,Definite integrals have a defined boundary
Chris,yes
Chris,Shutup and calculate is just another way of saying plug and chug
Chris,When you have found the antiderivative of a given function
Chris,and you want to calculate with the given boundary
Chris,To solve those what I've been doing is integrating and then plugging the 2 limits into the new equation and subtracting one from the other.
Chris,"It comes from physics land where students get to philosophical about what equations mean so the teachers shout ""SHUTUP AND CALCULATE!"""
Chris,@Max is your school trimesters or semesters?
Chris,semesters
Chris,Ahh
Chris,That's why you covered integration in calc 1
Chris,We have 3 calc courses 
Chris,So should Max
Chris,I mean my school does have calc 3
Chris,but I don't need to take it
Chris,Calc 3 is multivariable calculus
Chris,Chemistry majors only need up to calc 2
Chris,TBH now I'm confused and am not sure which calculi are available at my uni 
Chris,you should have calc 1-3

Chris,"Airheads God Tier, KitKat God tier, Reese dropped to very solid, Candy Cigarette dropped to suck"
Chris,How the fuck are airheads god tier
Chris,Airheads actually a tier above god tier
Chris,Not just saying this to fuck with you guys
Chris,This tier list is garbage
Chris,Airheads are #1 candy
Chris,Puts hot tamales in the pixie sticks tier this doesn’t even make any sense
Chris,They suck just as much as pixie sticks
Chris,I can understand why you disagree that it’s god tier but I’m genuinely baffled why airheads is rated as a low tier candy
Chris,LAFFY TAFFY IS GOOD
Chris,Unless you’re ranking it low cause like “oh it’s sticky if you hold it”
Chris,WAY BETTER THAN AIRHEADS
Chris,SMH
Chris,Airheads taste good
Chris,they aight
Chris,this is the worst tiers list of all time
Chris,Clearly the people who made this tier list had no hard candy proponents on their board of directors
Chris,How biased
Chris,How discriminatory
Chris,how are dots and health very solid ???
Chris,calling HR
Chris,those are both pretty nasty
Chris,There wasn't much hard candy here anyways
Chris,Also laffy taffy and airheads suck
Chris,settle this like civilized men and women
Chris,fight to the death
Chris,You have to put way too much effort into eating them for very little payoff
Chris,LAFFY TAFFY TASTES SUPER GOOD WYM
Chris,and theyre not hard to eat at all
Chris,im boutta throw hands
Chris,Throw them
Chris,also fun dip is great dont @ me
Chris,bro square up
Chris,I'm squared up
Chris,
Chris,yea maybe fun dip and laffy taffy are good if you like to suffer
Chris,Laffy Taffy better than airheads no cap
Chris,they both trash
Chris,No
Chris,they just sugar
Chris,if i wanna eat sugar
Chris,i would just eat sugar
Chris,They solid at lowest
Chris,yea
Chris,solidly in the lowest tier
Chris,Reese's overrated
Chris,that's patently false
Chris,No
Chris,@Mr. Airplane
Chris,Holy shit this is so bad
Chris,How the fuck are pixie sticks in c
Chris,Fun dip in b
Chris,Holy shit
Chris,sorry that you're wrong
Chris,EDIT: updated tier names adn dropped jawbreakers down a tier cause idk why i had them as high as they were

Chris,"Speedrunning leaderboards, resources, forums, and more!"
Chris,This is the greatest disservice I have ever seen for left handed people
Chris,We only get the left armrest
Chris,Everyone else has two except for the poor right handed person beside me
Chris,wouldn't that make it good for left handed people?
Chris,yea wait hold up
Chris,“””technically””” in the best (worst?) case where all seats are filled everyone else also only gets one armrest since you ain’t putting ur arm on someone else’s
Chris,otherwise you get below average armrests
Chris,oh snap it's elvin
Chris,just sit in one of hte center seats if you want two armrests so bad
Chris,the god
Chris,alvin
Chris,my favourite chipmunk
Chris,dab
Chris,also @Eric Working From Home ur candy tier list is high key awful
Chris,"your argument that ""its just sugar so why wouldnt i jsut eat sugar"" is the dumbest thing ive ever heard"
Chris,okay that was a joke
Chris,but actually
Chris,pixie sticks
Chris,are just sugar in a paper tube
Chris,crutches at school is not the move
Chris,there is no appeal to that whatsoever
Chris,also what jed said that too
Chris,thats why they C tier
Chris,"pixie sticks have no flavor, they are messy, and they make you want to die after eating them"
Chris,you put reese way too high
Chris,ok they arent messy
Chris,if you make a mess with them you're big dubm
Chris,reeses are clearly the best candy
Chris,what if you wanted to die before eating them
Chris,You literally can't eat them
Chris,If they get any moisture in them whatsoever
Chris,im convinced you two are disabled
Chris,It's game over
Chris,^
Chris,dont spit into the tube then??????
Chris,???
Chris,You have to put the tube to your mouth to eat it
Chris,you guys are also way too hung up on the pixie sticks i put them into C tier you monkeys
Chris,It's inevitable
Chris,oml how do you function
Chris,you turn the tube over nd pour it onto ur tongue
Chris,"Plus, even if you do get anything out of them"
Chris,like you dont suck the shit outta a tube
Chris,They don't even taste good
Chris,the only candy that i would consider being worse than pixie sticks is hot tamales
Chris,i put them C tier i dont know why you're so hung up on them
Chris,its not like i put them in A tier
Chris,In
Chris,What
Chris,World
Chris,Are they better than
Chris,Resses pieces
Chris,??????????????????
Chris,"hot tomales are like someone took mike and ikes and went ""yea these are incredibly disappointing, but i think we could make them worse"""
Chris,cause reeses pieces are big 
Chris,its like skittles meets the bad part of reeses
Chris,Ok
Chris,I just saw that you put York peppermint patties below them
Chris,Your opinion on candy is so bad
Chris,the fact that the bottom tier contained spicy candy is the only thing that saved yorks from bottom tier
Chris,yorks are actually
Chris,so
Chris,fucking
Chris,bad
Chris,you know what
Chris,i'd put them on the same level of hot tamales
Chris,york peppermint patties are the most vile disgusting shit in hte world
Chris,like peppermint marshmallow
Chris,what the fuck
Chris,youn know what fuck hot tamales im putting york patties in hte bottom tier
Chris,Looking more into your tier list
Chris,"bruh i dunno how i can trust anyone's opinion who puts CRUNCH above REECES, TWIX, HEATH, and SNICKERS"
Chris,You have fundip above twix
Chris,And twizzlers
Chris,that might be the worst take in this whole list
Chris,"hot take, twix bigly not good"
Chris,twix kinda meh
Chris,crunch is the worst chocolate bar free
Chris,Also
Chris,Skittles below fundip
Chris,no
Chris,What planet are you on?
Chris,twix is a crunchy flavourless cookie pretending to be a chocolate bar by adding in infinitesimal amounts fo chocolate and caramel
Chris,crunch is good
Chris,idk whats wrong with you
Chris,crunch is the kinda chocolate bar that you eat when you have given up on enjoying chocolate bars
Chris,chris the kinda guy with such shit taste in candy he puts this stuff in S tier
Chris,crunch is literally just a milk chocolate bar with crunchy pieces
Chris,idk what you find wrong with it
Chris,yes
Chris,you guys also thuroughly did not give milk duds enough credit
Chris,like unless you're lowering its rank cause its like cement for your teeth
Chris,cause if you your list loses all credit then
Chris,that is exactly why we put it lower
Chris,you guys are goons
Chris,also it snowing outside widepeepohappy
Chris,we're not ranking how fucking ergonomic the candy is
Chris,that is part of the consumption pprocess
Chris,we ranking how good it tastes
Chris,you moron
Chris,you fool
Chris,yall are some fucking reeses shills might I add
Chris,when trick or treating I wouldn't even trade my reeses pieces for anything I'd literally give that shit away
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,i should've known Chris' Cnady tier list would be shit cause of that time when he asked what candy i wanted i said gummies and this MF got Sour Cola Bottle Gummies
Chris,not even normal ones

Chris,cola

Chris,@Matt  i got 11 lights
Chris,9 regular and lux
Chris,Just got back from a reddit event at the board game café. It was pretty fun. 
Chris,what does that mean
Chris,It means people in the Houston board games subreddit said that there would be a lot of people there that day and they invited others to come join them. The store even gave a discount if you mentioned the subreddit.
Chris,nice
Chris,
Chris,I will be distancing myself from the other Zacks after discovering what shit taste they have
Chris,Literally
Chris,cereal
Chris,
Chris,This cereal tier list is pretty good
Chris,yeah
Chris,Much better than the candy one
Chris,we made it with group think
Chris,that's why kamerons bad opinions didn't make it to light
Chris,
Chris,fuuuuck the internet historian just released an hour long video
Chris,but I need to write an essy
Chris,oops
Chris,N O M A N S S K Y
Chris,whatabouttit
Chris,Internet historians video is about that
Chris,"Corn flakes isnt an ""organic"" ceral tf?"
Chris,
Chris,well it is tasteless
Chris,"Also the ""organic"" tier was a meme"
Chris,ah like my meatloaf ingredient tier
Chris,but also i heard feeding people grape nuts is banned by hte geneva convention
Chris,"and @Rotomotorz corn flakes are tasteless to stop masturbation, its by design"
Chris,
Chris,god yall so uneducated
Chris,"It might just be that your distaste for corn flakes is not by accident though, as Mr Kellogg actually developed cornflakes primarily to stop children from masturbating!  He had particular ideas about masturbation, writing, “if illicit commerce of the sexes is a heinous sin, self-pollution is a crime doubly abominable.” He felt that certain foods inspired ‘self-pollution’, like spicy foods,  meat, and generally anything that tasted too good. One of the biggest fights he had with his brother, and business partner, was over adding sugar to cornflakes. Kellogg’s brother had the (right) idea that sugar would vastly improve the taste of the cereal, but Kellogg stood by his original vision, that of plain and boring, sexual desire killing food, so the flakes remained unsweetened."
Chris,also hot take
Chris,french topast crunch
Chris,not that good
Chris,That's the hottest take
Chris,Because it is so wrong
Chris,undeniably worse that cinnamon toast crunch at the very least
Chris,atleast the latter has flavour
Chris,wait this corn flake story is hilarious
Chris,kellogg is actually stupid
Chris,well he became very rich and thne very dead
Chris,@Eric Working From Home your list is bad
Chris,My list may be bad but I stand by French toast crunch being at most B tier material
Chris,gamers
Chris,non-gamers
Chris,D:
Chris,daheck the iceborn monster hunter dlc is $40
Chris,It's a whole new storyline with a bunch of new monsters and more
Chris,New area aswell
Chris,so like
Chris,1/5th of a game
Chris,theres like 12 new monsters
Chris,31 total
Chris,so like 2/5th of a game
Chris,get it right
Chris,
Chris,Joined the server.
Chris,yo i told you guys french toast cruch was top teir
Chris,it really aint tho
Chris,"cheap, tasty, affordable for a broke student living by the paycheck ."
Chris,
Chris,the community consistently ranks it B-C tier
Chris,lucky charms is too sweet.
Chris,it is cheap and affordable
Chris,honey nuts is s
Chris,but it is flavourless
Chris,It's literally not flavourless though
Chris,Like what
Chris,naw. you can taste the honey
Chris,that's what makes it good
Chris,Do you have a tounge?
Chris,must've had a bad box at your place then during meetup
Chris,also life is really good too
Chris,cause it was like flavourless cardboard cubes
Chris,frosted flakes is also way too sweet
Chris,nah forsted flakes S tier
Chris,yeah
Chris,cheerios is tasteless
Chris,you're saying everything is too sweet
Chris,i think maybe you just like mild flavours
Chris,either tasteless or too sweet
Chris,maybe thast why you like french toast crunch
Chris,bruh. i never said frootloops was too sweet
Chris,frootloops is S
Chris,that we can agree on
Chris,high A
Chris,jsut cause hte basis for S tier is frosted flakes
Chris,if we put frootloops in S we gotta make a new tier above S
Chris,frosted flakes becomes so spongey after like 30 seconds
Chris,yeah thats the best way to eat cereal
Chris,leave it in hte milk for like 1 minute so its no longer crunchy
Chris,thats my second hot take of the day
Chris,no
Chris,This is why we ignore your opinions
Chris,no. crunchy cereal with the slight taste of milk is the best
Chris,so you're rather have mini wheats like right as you put the milk in when the inside is still fully dry
Chris,we fuck mini wheats
Chris,rather than let the milk permeate it
Chris,kuz it's disgusting
Chris,this fucker eats his mini wheats dry
Chris,
Chris,mini wheats is disgusting
Chris,wtfd
Chris,benson your taste in cereal is so shit
Chris,at least i have a tongue kuz i can actually taste the honey in the honey nut
Chris,im aware theres honey in honey nut
Chris,i jsut still do not enjoy it
Chris,also. more people here prefer crunchy cereal here.
Chris,im no longer on hte milky vs Dry cereal debate
Chris,mini wheats are good
Chris,they sweetness doesn't go well with the milk. if you're unfortunate enough to have 3% it tastes even worse. at that point you're eating cream with laxities.
Chris,im like 90% sure your tastebuds jsut finna dont work
Chris,you out here saying everyhitng too sweet
Chris,if it has even a semblance of flavour
Chris,i'm probably more sensitive to sweetness than you are. also not everything is too sweet. plus i never said mini wheats was too sweet.
Chris,
Chris,ok maybe that i coulda worded that better
Chris,mini wheats tastes like frosting. which doesnt go well with milk. it's like mixing mint and chocolate
Chris,bruh
Chris,you ever heard of mint chocolate chip
Chris,or andes mints
Chris,i have. but mint seems to ruin chocolate for me
Chris,I think your taste buds are broke
Chris,this guys taste buds def broke as hell
Chris,does cilantro taste slightly like mint to anyone here?
Chris,shit tastes like soap
Chris,soap* i meant soap
Chris,link the teirlist website
Chris,for cereal
Chris,nvm found it
Chris,
Chris,lucky charms i used to like.
Chris,but i cant eat it anymore.
Chris,krave is probably my favourite
Chris,and if the nesquick cereal was here it'd go in A teir
Chris,wrong
Chris,so wrong
Chris,i really like my milk.
Chris,if i'm gunna eat frosted flakes i'm gunna dump my milk with my unsweetend dark roast coffee
Chris,"bruh honey nut cheerios definitely ""ruins the milk"""
Chris,i see your point. but it's not as bad as frosted flakes
Chris,benson you put raisin bran over corn flakes
Chris,you opinion literally has negative validity
Chris,Devon you don't get to speak
Chris,actually shut up chris your shit taste extends beyond cereals
Chris,atleast benson kept his terrible taste localized to cereal
Chris,
Chris,@The Rona

What a visionary but seriously though Kameron do you need to bring something or is it optional. If it's not optional then bring something that you think is cool and come up with a way in witch it effected you.

Chris,10 mins
Chris,How's the novel coming along
Chris,"@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home Just played another game of Agricola, this time with the revised version (the one we played was the original), and thought you might want to hear my thoughts. 
1. The revised version is definitely an improvement upon the original. Everyone at the table had useful cards to play and some decent synergies; card quality just felt higher overall.
2. I think revised version + draft would be even better, as to allow for even better card synergies.
3. Restocking the spaces in the physical version is way less tedious than in TTS (not much we can do about that though).
4. Having a plan for food and getting it setup before the first harvest is VERY important, as having to waste actions on food later is painful when better action cards flip.
5. Overly focusing on one thing is bad. One player went totally in on the farming strategy and ended the game with 11 grain and 7 vegetables (max scoring is at 8 grain and 4 vegetables). While this is impressive, all the excess crops didn't help in the score department and this player didn't win.
6. I overall had a lot of fun and think we shouldn't give up on this game if we can find a way to use the revised edition cards."

Chris,yeah but I still have a small amount of hope
Chris,and if nothing else it's visually amazing
Chris,"and from talking to people who know more about the current guilty gear and more from people who've played the demo of the new one, it's still looking like a solid game, just not really in the same vein as the previous ones (apparently this one is just gonna be ""better street fighter"" if it continues in its current state)"

Chris,"How long after being locked in a grocery store would it take you to steal food to eat, with the assumption that you eventually be let out of the grocery store"
Chris,Wouldn't it make sense to eat as soon as you got hungry and just pay for it when they come back
Chris,you have no money
Chris,when you got locked in the store someone took your wallet aswell
Chris,then whats he doing there
Chris,are you dumb
Chris,I would eat once I was hungry. There is no way they could charge me for a crime if they locked me in. I would win.
Chris,browsing
Chris,what are you winning
Chris, Cops are gone 
Chris,The court case
Chris,They would settle it with me. They would have serious bad press to worry about if they locked me in. They would probably pay me to keep my mouth shut and not care if I munched a few chips to keep myself alive.

Chris,"Ike is too one dimensional, Bowser is pretty matchup dependent, and Toon Link isn't good enough."
Chris,Maybe I could give Pikachu another try.
Chris,just play ike he not bad
Chris,He was the character I kept coming back to
Chris,maybe
Chris,Ike + Bowser would be a fun duo
Chris,hey i like both of those characters
Chris,"Is that a ""back off"" type of message?"

Chris,Genesis boy pog
Chris,How was the flight?
Chris,I was gonna have nothing to do all morning but one of my friends was on my flight so we played friendlies for a few hours
Chris,Nice
Chris,It was super short it kinda felt like I didn't go anywhere
Chris,It was like an hour and a half
Chris,Yea that's not too long
Chris,It would've taken like 10 hours to drive tho
Chris,Yeah
Chris,Short flights always feel weird cause the check-in and waiting for the plane always takes longer than the flight itself
Chris,Yeah
Chris,We had a bunch of smash players I know on the flight
Chris,Fat Goku sat like 2 seats away from me
Chris,That's sick
Chris,Who did you play friendlies with
Chris,Also I'm mega bored just waiting for my ENT
Chris,Just sitting in a room

Chris,Did you have a fucking stroke there buddy?
Chris,was laying on the floor and reached up to try and type games

Chris,On the floor
Chris,
Chris,??
Chris,What the fuck
Chris,
Chris,I am never using one of the restrooms by the foundry ever again
Chris,These people are ANIMALS
Chris,Bruh who does that in the space x IBM apple Lockheed Martin Uber office headquarters
Chris,You forgot Google aswell
Chris,No I didn't
Chris,i cant believe berkshire hathaway would hire someone who does that
Chris,also yes Oakland is pretty ghetto be careful
Chris,it's like 90% very sketchy and after the first time I went there I decided it'd be the bright move to just uber both in and out
Chris,also like two people were murdered there in the four months I was nearby
Chris,Yeah I'm not planning on being anywhere other than the bnb and venue after today
Chris,You forgot Amazon and Netflix
Chris,i heard there was a round 1 near there

Chris,Did someone say furry 
Chris,
Chris,The Aussie player I'm seeded to play is fucking good
Chris,But he's in my bnb and I'm getting the download
Chris,stream it
Chris,"Just played some more agricola, this time with the school board game club. Really enjoying the game."
Chris,board game club 
Chris,More like
Chris,Board game club 
Chris,Lmao my sponsor really out here dropping me the morning of genesis
Chris,Oof
Chris,Place higher than 16th and show them who they shouldnt have dropped
Chris,It's only cause I called him out about getting the money he said I'd get in October
Chris,Hmm that sounds illegal on their part
Chris,I mean he said that atk doesn't deserve me and doesn't think I'm a good fit
Chris,Do you have email/message chains?
Chris,Well he sent me the money today
Chris,Aight that's not too bad then
Chris,But it still might be worth going public with provided that's not a breach of contract
Chris,"Yeah just kind of stupid that he'd just drop me with no discussion, I've literally been with the org for over a year now and joined at it's conception"
Chris,So here's the funny thing
Chris,"""They didn't pay me and when I gave them shit about it they fired me for 'not being a good fit'"" is kind of a huge red flag"
Chris,I never signed a contract so I can say whatever I want
Chris,"Like, wanting money from your sponsor is kinda how sponsors work"
Chris,I'd say don't go overboard but it's an important cautionary tale
Chris,Yeah I'm probably gonna tweet and just say that I've been let go and the circumstances behind it
Chris,Yaw
Chris,"Be honest, don't be overly vicious (don't want to alienate potential future sponsors), but also make it clear that there appears to be a correlation between wanting to be paid and not being a good fit"
Chris,Yeah
Chris,F. Sorry to hear that Jed
Chris,"It's okay, I was kind of thinking about it anyways cause I was getting really frustrated"
Chris,It took bemmie almost 5 months to get me the money
Chris,And I would ask kindly once a month
Chris,Until last month u started to show I was getting upset
Chris,Cause he keeps running all these tournaments with thousands of dollars on the line
Chris,How much money did you get anyways?
Chris,150 for one event
Chris,Which is better than what most rivals sponsorships do
Chris,also do they handle travel fees and stuff?
Chris,So it was a hella good deal and that's why I wanted to stay
Chris,They way that they did it was they reimbursed half my flight
Chris,But I had to buy the ticket and send them the reciept
Chris,are they still gonna reimburse your genesis travel?
Chris,I highly doubt it
Chris,We barely discussed it
Chris,"I said ""I assume genesis reimbursement is out of the question as I still haven't gotten the reimbursement from heatwave"""
Chris,yikes
Chris,That's a big F
Chris,"although now he has an excuse to be like ""yup not paying for genesis"""
Chris,"also that's probably something worth mentioning in your post ""so I flew out to genesis while still on the team and they're not gonna be paying my flight"""
Chris,Yeah I'm gonna write it up after I've thought about it
Chris,One of my now ex teammates is at genesis and I'm gonna try and find him
Chris,Not sure if this is real homies but stay safe

Chris,I just saw an article by a veteran Terraforming Mars player that said building cities is one of the worst strategies in the game. I'm not sure how that could be given that my city spam in the second game we played seemed so effective.
Chris,I guess we never really understood how to play the game at all
Chris,Someday I'll probably try it again
Chris,"Now that I'm thinking about it more, I feel like I actually probably liked the game, but that feeling was overshadowed by the rather negative table atmosphere and how much everyone else seemed to be miserable."
Chris,"Logically, it has two of my favorite things in a game, drafting and engine building, so I should probably like it."
Chris,"I think that if I could be shown/show myself with more plays that the game has more viable strategies than city spam like that article claims, I could probably have fun playing the game."
Chris,@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home

Chris,hbox has really bad di
Chris,also marth puff on dreamland looks practically impossible
Chris,even tho zain is winning
Chris,he is just way better
Chris,Hbox is carried by puff
Chris,I feel like he's just gotten really complacent
Chris,he dragged puff up for years
Chris,but now that he's on top he's getting lazy
Chris,I would say he actually used to be carried by puff even more than now. See his skill with other characters over time as evidence.
Chris,his secondaries have always kinda sucked?
Chris,They are way better now
Chris,but in general I'd say he is the reason he's carried by puff
Chris,"not only is dreamland busted for puff, but it also kills the momentum of the other player"
Chris,like he made puff into a character who can carry
Chris,and then stopped pushing her as a character
Chris,and now he's letting his past work carry him
Chris,and now everyone's figuring out how to counter that
Chris,bro he literally never used the sing punish on marth until like last year
Chris,thats how little he innovates
Chris,"wow, one (1) new piece of tech"
Chris,naw it was evidence for your point moron
Chris,yeah I was agreeing
Chris,he stopped innovating after like 2017
Chris,hbox is honestly so lame
Chris,I would say that at that point in time he was carrying puff but now he's just letting puff carry him
Chris,the worst guy to be the best melee player
Chris,never plays friendlies
Chris,at least people are figuring him out
Chris,doesnt innovate or play to the meta
Chris,camps when he is losing
Chris,like I think unless he starts working hard again he's not holding onto #1 for another year
Chris,think about how unstoppable he looked in early 2019
Chris,and now he's got a whole bunch of frequent losses
Chris,look how much data he gets by playing games on dreamland
Chris,"zain, wizzy for a bit, hbox sometimes, especially leffen"
Chris,i dunno if winning a game on dreamland vs hbox is even a good idea
Chris,"Go Zain, saving melee"
Chris,"and he's got hax, leffen, fiction all chilling down there"
Chris,it'd be fairly insane if he even makes grands
Chris,dammit I want to make dinner but there's like no sets I don't want to watch
Chris,I guess I'll wait for hbox fiction
Chris,fuck which set is next
Chris,can I just leave during the ad break?
Chris,but it's probably gonna be leffen hax
Chris,smash gg says that leffen hax is next
Chris,darn
Chris,HAX$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Chris,tweet incoming 
Chris,THE ROOM WAS COLD
Chris,idk if the box should be leagl. in my opinion the set should be replayed?
Chris,I WAS DISTRACTED BY THE LIGHTING

Chris,if i was playing well i would win the whole tourney

5th ain't too bad to start my comeback off with I guess. We'll take it all things considered!"
Chris,SPAM  THIS  CRUSTACEAN  FOR  HBOX  ELIMINATION 
Chris,Hax is abusing puff's lackluster defense very well
Chris,HAX$ IS NUTS
Chris,hax stay strong
Chris,go slow
Chris,welp
Chris,that was a choke and a half
Chris,We take those
Chris,plot armor

Chris,"Beating the World’s Best at Super Smash Bros. Melee with Deep Reinforcement
Learning"
Chris,@solarlight
Chris,Andrew what is this?
Chris,
Chris,Can you read?
Chris,"One particularly clever player found that the simple strategy of crouching at the edge of the stage caused the network to behave very oddly, refusing to attack and eventually KOing itself by falling off the other side of the stage. One hypothesis to explain this weakness is the lack of diversity in training - since the network only played against old copies of itself, it never encountered such a degenerate strategy"
Chris,absolutely large brain
Chris,RIGHT
Chris,Its a cool paper

Chris,What
Chris,?
Chris,so
Chris,fuck essays
Chris,True
Chris,Settle a debate https://www.strawpoll.me/19347040
Chris,THe is our high five phrase
Chris,"Vote Now! [Up high, down low fakes out high five too slow] [Up high, down low, in the middle fakes out high five too slow]"
Chris,It’s supposed to say the fake out not “the is our” autocorrect
Chris,Yo wait
Chris,who the fuck out here saying in the middle
Chris,Cause Ashley says you don’t say in the middle but I’m saying you gotta day in the middle so that you have proper rhyming sequence
Chris,Literally never met anybody why doesn’t do in the middle
Chris,Tf
Chris,Wait
Chris,Also Chris don’t vote I want to know what the general populace does and you have time and time again shown you don’t do a single normal thing
Chris,How does saying in the middle make it a rhyming sequence
Chris,It literally doesn't rhyme
Chris,"Cause it it goes 
Up high (not rhyming line)
Down low (setup for the rhyme)
In the middle (additional line to keep the rhymes on alternating lines)
Too slow (Rhyme Payoff)"
Chris,If you lead a single not rhyming line into two back to back rhyming lines it messes with the flow
Chris,I guess that makes sense
Chris,Listen to any song
Chris,Okay
Chris,I feel like your thing works better in text
Chris,I feel like it works better in practice aswell
Chris,Nah
Chris,Cause the rhyme part is tacked onto the middle line
Chris,So it doesn't feel like payoff for the down low line
Chris,you feel
Chris,The only additional payoff of not adding in the middle is that if you fake out the low high five it leaves their hand lingering in a downward instead of horizontal motion
Chris,You don’t need lay-off on every like
Chris,Payoff*
Chris,Line*
Chris,"Like example
Life is old there (spacing)
Older than the trees (setup)
Younger than the mountains (spacing)
Blowing like a breeze (payoff)"
Chris,There no payoff on the mountains line cause it’s added as spacing
Chris,I think the clear distinction here is that your example is a song while the high five action is not
Chris,bruh who be saying in the middle
Chris,You're trying to turn it into a song
Chris,probably dumb people
Chris,But it doesn't need to be
Chris,It’s not a song it’s a rhyme sequence though
Chris,Genuinely never met people who didn’t say in the middle until now tf
Chris,Well here's the thing with that
Chris,You mostly do this joke to kids
Chris,So your family probably played it on you using the middle version
Chris,You aren't exposed to how other people say it because the other people you are exposed to in your life probably realize that you are too old to fall for the joke
Chris,I feel like the desire for there to be patterns in the rhyming sequence is a natural thing not something you learn like why “tock tick” sounds worse than “tick tock” there’s an actual like psychological reason for that
Chris,Ergo you never meet anyone that would say it the other way
Chris,Idk about you bro but I still be pulling the fake out high fives to this day
Chris,That’s how we got onto this topic of discussion
Chris,in the middle breaks the rythymic sequence which imo sounds worse
Chris,though ive heard both
Chris,That just wrong tho
Chris,It doesn’t break the sequence the fuck?
Chris,I think it could be due to kids not picking up on the rhyme the way you propose it though
Chris,Not adding it breaks the sequence
Chris,It's more clear that the rhyme is intended when the middle portion is excluded
Chris,To kids at least
Chris,What dumbass kids are you dealing with
Chris,The fuck
Chris,"yeah ""up high"" ""down low"" and ""too slow"" are all two syllable"
Chris,If you play a kid country roads are they not gonna notice trees rhymes with breeze
Chris,"""in the middle"" is 4"
Chris,It’s the bridging line Greg
Chris,Cause I was doing it to Ashley and when I said “down low” she slapped my hand with the might of a thousand suns then was like “why didn’t you try and pull your hand away” and I was like cause I pull it away in the middle and that’s how we got here
Chris,That line is from way back I just had to keep deleting and refusing it cause Greg kept saying some@dumb shit that I had to respond to right away
Chris,Hence why it doesn’t make sense in the conversation
Chris,fwiw i’ve always heard it w/ “in the middle”
Chris,e

Chris,@Mr. Airplane @Eric Working From Home @Rotomotorz Just finished an in person game of Terra Mystica. I played the Fakirs to handicap myself but still got  133. Pretty happy with that score given how bad they are.
Chris,wow the coronavirus is really getting to max
Chris,I should have gotten 136 but I forgot to take water 1 for my sanctuary
Chris,
Chris,tragic
Chris,OH SHIT HES SO WIDE
Chris,network wide asf
Chris,"Carpet flight, earth 1, and dwelling round meant I scored 44 points in the last turn plus another 8 for passing with the sanctuary stronghold bonus card with both in play."
Chris,"On another note, I'm even more happy with the score when I consider I had both neighboring colors in play (which the Fakirs especially dislike)."
Chris,welp I got a new celeste PB but I'm real sad
Chris,the splits tell a tragic tale

Chris,damn that sucks
Chris,Bro that’s fucked
Chris,hunt him down
Chris,How does one manage to hit the side of a car in a driveway
Chris,These are the people you share the road with everyday
Chris,"Could of been an animal, or some dude with a bat"
Chris,bro how an animal bouta do that
Chris,there aren't like bison walking around in florida
Chris,Humans are animals
Chris,
Chris,Human drive car
Chris,car hit car
Chris,i mena a deer could do that
Chris,^
Chris,That was my original idea
Chris,It looks all scratched up though at the bottom so it looks like it was acutally a car
Chris,how tf did that other car even get onto your driveway tbh
Chris,like wtf were they doing
Chris,the funniest thing about it is that I dont have a normal driveway
Chris,like my car was pretty far from the road
Chris,Draw a diagram
Chris,
Chris,Wow
Chris,That was really fast
Chris,and detailed
Chris,You should be an artist
Chris,but real talk I was sideways up by the door
Chris,and even then the road is a good couple feet behind me
Chris,Damn sucks dude
Chris,"Okay, theory time"
Chris,Some guy needed to turn around
Chris,so he pulls into your driveway to do it
Chris,hits your car
Chris,Theory time over
Chris,nah apparently people heard the guy speeding down the road and slamming into my car
Chris,but no one did anything

Chris,Who here has played the Steam version of UNO?
Chris,I wasn't even aware that there was a steam version of UNO. I've played it on tabletop simulator though.
Chris,"I think it's only like... $5-10...?
I've seen a few YouTubers play it and it actually looks kind fun."
Chris,It's got special rules you can enable... And different game settings with special cards.
Chris,"For example, 7s & 0s
Play a 7, you swap hands with someone
Play a 0, all hands rotate in the direction of the turn order."
Chris,Frostbite uno night @Tabletop
Chris,ok
Chris,uno?

Chris,jesus fuck what
Chris,I'm watching dbfz world tour finals
Chris,grand finals
Chris,go1 vs fenritti
Chris,"game one: go1 perfects fenritti
game two: fenritti perfects go1"
Chris,what the actual fuck
Chris,was it like 100-0 both games lol?
Chris,yeah
Chris,lol
Chris,do you know how rare a single perfect is in dbfz?
Chris,insanely rare
Chris,I don't watch this game that often but I've literally never seen one until today
Chris,well i mean if you can 100-0 i cant imagine its that rare
Chris,"""If you can do it, it's not rare"""
Chris,a 100-0 is a guaranteed perfect
Chris,
Chris,you jsut gotta land hte first hit
Chris,you dingus
Chris,when i say 100-0 i mean you hit a guy when hes full health and fully kill him without dropping combo
Chris,"you can only 100-0 with sparking (which is a once-per-game thing, and also often used defensively) and hella bar"
Chris,and only on one of their three characters
Chris,most of the time it's 2-3 openings per character
Chris,so you pretty much need 5-9 straight openings to perfect someone
Chris,"depending on your team (damage-heavy vs neutral/mix-heavy vs balanced) and meter management (meter for damage vs meter for mixups, sparking for defense vs damage vs pressure)"
Chris,nerd
Chris,@Master Memers I have it on good authority that @The Rona is the suck dick man
Chris,https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/662012908284280853.gif?v=1
Chris,COCK
Chris,you're the suck cock man?
Chris,cheese is kinda insane at sm64
Chris,
Chris,oof
Chris,I got an A so I'm fine but I feel bad for the others
Chris,(this was a Gen Chem II test)
Chris,it might get curved
Chris,I've never seen a math/science test get curved
Chris,don't you curve by the highest grade tho
Chris,I remember one of my old housemates calling her parents about getting a 28% on a midterm but that was okay since the class average was 22%
Chris,lol
Chris,damn
Chris,and that was engineering
Chris,but I guess it might depend on the school for what gets curved
Chris,"but still, odds are if it gets curved max's grade goes up"
Chris,I know my school curves business classes like accounting
Chris,"Also, my grade was 100 so it cannot go up"
Chris,ah well
Chris,This was supposedly the easiest test too
Chris,The class may shrink to a tiny size by the end of the semester if this trend continues
Chris,my guess is that those 6 people who failed are dragging the average down since most people seem to have done aight
Chris,they've probably given up on the course but haven't dropped yet
Chris,"meanwhile, in courses I wish I could drop, currently working on an assignment where this is one part of it:"
Chris,I have no idea what 'layout 2' is
Chris,this is the only use of the word 'layout' in the entire assignment
Chris,hmmm
Chris,so I've just decided to make my best guess at what they want here
Chris,"unfortunately, the whole assignment is like this"
Chris,so I'm making my best guess at like... half
Chris,this course is terrible but also mandatory
Chris,What course is this?
Chris,Software Requirements
Chris,it's all about how to plan software
Chris,"with the caveat that this is not, in any way, how anything works at any actual company"
Chris,sounds useless
Chris,it's a course about the pipe dream of how we wish people told us to make software
Chris,and the prof uses the word 'requirements' more than the word 'the'
Chris,it's 80% common sense and 20% buzzwords
Chris,I wish I still had classes where I could pass the tests on common sense alone
Chris,yes but also it's mind-numbingly boring and a shocking amount of work
Chris,I've been working on this assignment since like 2
Chris,ouch
Chris,most of that time has been consulting other people in the class and trying to put together a picture of wtf the prof wants us to do
Chris,Unclear instructions are the actual worst
Chris,You seem to get them a lot of the time
Chris,at this point we've all given up actually figuring anything out and we're just doing going with our best assumptions about what he wants
Chris,I hope he enjoys the eight pages of BS he's gonna be getting
Chris,also I hope that he stops doing the thing where whenever he posts the slides for a lecture it's all the slides for the whole course up until that point so you have to scroll through an increasingly long series of slides to reach the new stuff
Chris,"I may complain about my school a lot, but the one thing I will give it credit for is that the professors are of shockingly high quality on average."
Chris,mine are usually solid but there's generally one disaster per term
Chris,I've been told that's because my school attracts people who like the teaching part of being a prof rather than the research part.
Chris,"and yes, it's usually the researchers"
Chris,im zack's professor
Chris,Someone in my chem group chat just says he got a zero on the exam
Chris,i hate zack
Chris,I hope he read that one wrong
Chris,He did indeed
Chris,he actually got an A
Chris,the only test i've ever passed was a test on how to fail tests

Chris,GG
Chris,"there were group fuckups and I had to move to another group, they didn't change my group assignment in the system but said they'd match my final project's marks with the new group's"
Chris,that never fucking happened
Chris,final project was worth 30% of my grade
Chris,and with a zero on the system
Chris,I failed the course
Chris,thank god I have emails from the prof/TAs saying they'd do it
Chris,I've probably spent several hours over the last few weeks deliberating on what game to buy (board game) now that I have access to a place to play them weekly. I feel like my inability to choose is killing me but these games are just so expensive.
Chris,B U Y  T H E M
Chris,coward
Chris,
Chris,
Chris,"so quick question. Any of you guys know of a kind of sweet candy/chocolate that has cream in the middle? I know it sounds like a weird question, but I'm doing research.

and I want a serious answer......"
Chris,like a twinky?
Chris,"maybe, but not quite"
Chris,I mean I might know the thing you're thinking of but just not immediately connecting the dots
Chris,"I'm not sure if something like this exists.... but I'm thinking of something that's kind of like the length of a churro, but cream filled"
Chris,crunchy? soft?
Chris,
Chris,maybe more like crunchy?
Chris,these things?
Chris,yeah something like that
Chris,it would be better if they were like a type of candy though.... but I can make this work if nothing else
Chris,happy to kinda sorta help
Chris,
Chris,What is this for??
Chris,a valentines gift
Chris,
Chris,For someone?
Chris,"yeah, a co-worker"
Chris,Oooh :0
Chris,good luck!
Chris, love is in the air
Chris,huzzah ya boi is getting the runaround by campus faculty
Chris,still stuck waiting on that one prof to fix my grade so that I'm not failing
Chris,found out that half the systems show me failing another course but the other half show me passing it so I'm also waiting on a fix for that
Chris,found out that my credits from the summer school I took back in 2016 never got transferred so I'm short six credits (equivalent to one full-year course) to graduate unless I can get that fixed and no one seems quite sure how that process is gonna work so I keep getting passed off to new people
Chris,and now all the faculty offices are closed so instead of shlepping all around campus I have to send emails which are inevitably gonna get ignored for awhile
Chris,Damn that shit must be fucking infuriating hope you get it all sorted out
Chris,yeh
Chris,I've at least done all I can for today until people email me back
Chris,Zack boi where are you going to work?
Chris,Where do you WANT* to work?
Chris,fuckin anywhere at this point
Chris,but honestly in the here and now my focus is on making sure I can dodge all these weird administrative fuckups and actually graduate
Chris,"cause it'd be real awkward to get hired and be like ""surprise I gotta do one more term of school cause my credits ain't got transferred properly"""
Chris,Well just remember you don't have to be honest on your resume. You can put you have your degree then explain the situation
Chris,IF THEY FUCK UP
Chris,I might be wrong but I feel like resumes are just ice breakers
Chris,"And if you are honest but can't even get your foot in the door, you will never have a chance to prove yourself "
Chris,GOOD LUCK BUDDY
Chris,I would hire you 
Chris,Just finished my first calculus 2 test (was an online class so I could have procrastinated in to next Monday at the latest) . Now I can go play terra mystica again tomorrow guilt free

Chris,"like actual pain, not just cold"
Chris,Why the fuck is gotta be -22 on the day I wear the distressed denim smh
Chris,Bro I just saw some mother fucker in shorts
Chris,ballsy
Chris,I respect it
Chris,I knew someone in elementary school who did that
Chris,killed like 2/3 of the nerves in his legs and he doesn't feel cold anymore

Chris,@Rotomotorz
Chris,Axe is crazy
Chris,
Chris,I wish rivals was as big as melee
Chris,"Rivals is a cool game, I would also like it to be better known"
Chris,Wrastor is maybe my favorite platform fighter character ever

Chris,but ill sauce you ip and you can join the next time its up 
Chris,
Chris,I'll play mc
Chris,okay I'm back @Cs:go
Chris,"i would be interested, but I think people are gone"
Chris,You're dumb
Chris,is that a yay or nay from you smith
Chris,"When I ordered something from Amazon it said the delivery would be Sunday. The page was still up and it said it could ""ship by Saturday if you order within the next 6 hours!"" So I cancelled my order and ordered again lol. I have no idea why this happened."
Chris,The time gap between the orders was like 9 hours
Chris,"So I'm going to visit my brother over reading week, checked and apparently there was supposed to be a 2-3 hour wait to get through customs"
Chris,There was no line at all
Chris,My flight doesn't leave for another two hours
Chris,F
Chris,I'm sitting in a very overpriced restaurant staring down this bottle of fiji water they leave at every table and presumably have to pay like $15 if you open
Chris,go to a cheaper restaurant and feast on something?
Chris,They're all super expensive
Chris,Or moderately expensive and serve tiny portions
Chris,Feels Airport Man
Chris,And I haven't eaten yet today and my flight keeps getting delayed
Chris,So I'm willing to pay the five extra dollars for bigger better food
Chris,sounds like a plan
Chris,hbox legitimately looks unbeatable
Chris,he dominated 4 players who have historically gave him at least a bit of trouble
Chris,i dunno if fox beats puff tbh
Chris,not in b05 with sdi existing
Chris,I think fox is the best character against puff whether he wins or not
Chris,Puff is just overpowered. Puff gets to play brawl while everyone else plays melee.
Chris,amsa is sick
Chris,like he lost but he's sick
Chris,oh hope he gets better
Chris,@Cs:go
Chris,"If we get some peeps, sure"
Chris,ok
Chris,@trashpanda risky rain with me and devon
Chris,?
Chris,@Homies  we play MvM at some point tomorrow
Chris,Tomorrow is Summit finals day
Chris,No
Chris,Your point
Chris,I'm going to be occupied with that
Chris,Just don't
Chris,In addition to other things
Chris,Watch vods
Chris,
Chris,no
Chris,
Chris,max gay
Chris,
Chris,this summit final bracket is hype
Chris,zain plup
Chris,facts
Chris,hbox maNG
Chris,anyone can win tbh
Chris,maNG
Chris,BUMPED CAPS
Chris,again
Chris,also 9 top 10 players left
Chris,no m2k lol
Chris,wait there are like no top sheiks anymore
Chris,And then I said
Chris,Penis
Chris,yeah same
Chris,i think that if fox players win game 1 vs puff/marth they should just sd 4 times in the counterpick
Chris,like no meme
Chris,its more important to preserve momentum than to maybe win on the counterpick
Chris,I think people prone to tilting might do this but I don't think everyone should.
Chris,i do
Chris,at top level
Chris,its literally not worth the risk
Chris,fox never beats zain on fd
Chris,vs marth maybe I could see that everyone should
Chris,not vs puff though
Chris,even if you win dreamland
Chris,you have to play it again
Chris,giving hbox so much momentum and info
Chris,Maybe I'm biased because Dreamland is my favorite stage but I would never forfeit that game.
Chris,and it burns the fox player out
Chris,making them prone to make more mistakes in future games
Chris,The fact that this is even a discussion means the ruleset is broken
Chris,bans
Chris,id like to see the stats
Chris,of how much hbox wins on the fox's counterpick
Chris,after winning the second dreamland game
Chris,i guarantee its real high
Chris,why not just stand still on the counterpick
Chris,like honestly losing dreamland the first time might be better sometimes
Chris,plup is godlike
Chris,I think this is the first win vs Hbox since Plup won genesis
Chris,hbox hasnt lost so badly since mang0 at birthday bash
Chris,ggs
Chris,dreamland 
Chris,so dumb
Chris,puff dies early
Chris,that was a good tourney still
Chris,Yeah
Chris,Sup everyone?
Chris,hi

Chris,"In an extremely ill-advised decision, I'm currently at a casino with my brother"
Chris,Time to lose $80usd
Chris,win money
Chris,Good advice
Chris,Just think of gambling as paying for entertainment rather than a way to earn money
Chris, 
Chris,Well yeah
Chris,Also a way to make him stop bothering me about going to the casino
Chris,"I've heard that helps soften the blow of the inevitable loss and prevent going in too much to ""win it back"""
Chris,Yeah
Chris,I've committed to losing $80 and if I lose less it's an accomplishment
Chris,Good mindset
Chris,Bit of a roller coaster so far but atm I'm only down $4
Chris,Nice
Chris,$4 is not much
Chris,Lost like $50 on one hand tho
Chris,Playing poker?
Chris,he was playing blind and got triple sevens
Chris,What moron plays blind
Chris,"Yeah, Texas hold em"
Chris,Texas hold em is the only valid poker
Chris,Hes doing really well
Chris,Could afford to play blind one hand
Chris,Poker is the only gambling I would consider since I can use skill to win
Chris,"Yeah, to a point at least"
Chris,I'm alright at the game but have never played with real money
Chris,I've played for really small money once
Chris,First time at a casino tho
Chris,Im out lol
Chris,Pocket kings lost to pocket aces

Chris,Very quick
Chris,Super fast

Chris,This is Zack we are talking about
Chris,"@Homies I've recently discovered a game that I think could be great fun for our group if everyone is willing to learn it. It features highly asymmetric factions (apparently balanced), information trading, treachery, and alliance making and breaking. Tonight I am pretty free if people want to get together and play it on tabletop simulator. It plays best with 6 players so please let me know if you are interested. (The game is Dune)"
Chris,@Advanced Memers
Chris,"Players interested so far: Max, Chris, Devon, maybe Greg"
Chris,@Rotomotorz Were you interested?
Chris,maybe but depends on when u plan to play
Chris,"This evening, I suppose around 8:00 since that is when devon gets back"
Chris,I never said that
Chris,Where’s your proof
Chris,Please don't be difficult
Chris,I had that as an option so I could remove anyone who didn’t vote within the right demographic
Chris,Because I put it on a subreddit
Chris,Ty for taking my survey tho :)))
Chris,Dune sounds dumb
Chris,But any of you boys heard of zune?
Chris,Them boys play music
Chris,"Bruh a customer spent like $300 in the store and was like “I gotta stop spending so much money, I guess this is better than spending it on mafia city” and I was like “the phone app?” And this mf says “yeah I’ve sunk like $3000 into it with nothing to show for it”"
Chris,BRO
Chris,What
Chris,Why
Chris,No fucking clue
Chris,Who looks at an ad for that game

Chris,I would make one but I dont know how
Chris,so yell at @Zain to do it
Chris,"I mean I can do it, but wouldn't it be better to have the server hosted by someone who lives closer to everyone cuz I'm not that close relative to a lot of people in the server"
Chris,Sounds just like someone who doesn't want to set up the server
Chris,We should probably pick a modpack first though
Chris,Do we want a more vanilla friendly pack? An rpg-esque pack? A tech heavy pack?
Chris,I mean I'll set it up doesn't matter to me and tech heavy in my opinion
Chris,"Check out crackpack 3, All the mods 4, engineer's life, valhelsia 2, enigmatica 4"

Eventually realized that I'm arguing that the author is trying to show that a major component of good is to seek knowledge beyond that which is directly handed to you, and reaching that conclusion required me to put down the story he wrote and go read Plato to understand those four sentences.

- yelling at TOs over tiny changes to seeding
- yelling at other players
- general toxicity
- being so loud that you can clearly make out whatever he's ranting about from the far side of the venue

But what finally got him the ban was unapolagetically using 'faggot' and 'gay'. This went over poorly with our TOs, who are:

Chris,@Max they probably do not care
Chris,This was one of the classes 3 major assignments and not meeting the visual aid requirement is an instant F. If they care so little they would just fail a major assignment why would they even be there.
Chris,It's not like they didn't prepare a speech. The speeches were actually pretty alright.

Chris,"@Homies I have invented a social deduction game that is quite different from any that are currently popular (Secret Hitler, Avalon, Mafia, Werewolf, etc.) and would like to playtest it this weekend if possible. It features such things as a globally known person on the good side who cannot be killed and leads the investigation, the possibility to kill for the bad guys with risk involved for doing so, and an interesting bluffing dynamic of ""confinement without execution""."

Chris,Don't forget your 5 points
Chris,@The Rona Don't forget you can burn power
Chris,If you need stuff
Chris,Place on brown unless you need 2 towns there
Chris,Digging for 3 workers is a terrible idea
Chris,burn power
Chris,You could use double dig power action and build on both reds
Chris,@The Rona
Chris,actually you need to build a dwelling on the empty space first
Chris,so they are both in range
Chris,yeah
Chris,Now just try and get coins
Chris,I did it
Chris,For you
Chris,It moved from bowl 1
Chris,Did you tell him you can turn workers to money?
Chris,You should highly consider the 6 coin bonus
Chris,Yeah I think so
Chris,Do you want me to get your income Chris?
Chris,2 power
Chris,"Now you can easily prep at least 1 town for the town bonus round, maybe even 2."
Chris,This is a bad impression of the game for Chris @Mr. Airplane
Chris,sure
Chris,Chris and I were making such a great plan

Chris,this lookin mega weeb tbh

Chris,it's sooooo fuuuuun thooooo
Chris,What do you use as a controller for this?
Chris,"I'm using my stick, but it's pretty straightforward so I'd assume just about any controller or keyboard would work"
Chris,"it's 8-directional movement, 4 attacks, and one 'move slower so you can be more precise' button"
Chris,so just about any modern or modern-ish controller should be fine
Chris,I might get it later today
Chris,I've been bored
Chris,Though I wouldn't be able to talk while playing
Chris,"aight, lemme know if you want to play at some point (the multiplayer is way better than the single player imo)"

Chris,Gyazo
Chris,this some bullshit
Chris,What blizzard game do you even play?
Chris,cod
Chris,what do you guys think of these character designs?
Chris,One thing you might want to consider is that the girl's shirt looks like an Easter egg pattern. Whether or not you want that is up to you.
Chris,very saturated and clashing colors
Chris,Easter Egg pattern?
Chris,oh yeah it does lol
Chris,
Chris,it looks like a typical design you'd find on an easter egg
Chris,kinda like this
Chris,oh Shirt! I thought you said Skirt.
Chris,"but yeah, that's what the original shirt looked like, so I went with it"
Chris,but i think the dark blue on gray is no bueno
Chris,Original?
Chris,the values are way too similar you can hardly see the design
Chris,allow me to explain
Chris,I build my character designs by using bits and pieces from other designs...
Chris,this is where I got the shirt and jacket
Chris,Those colours work better
Chris,I agree ^
Chris,better contrast
Chris,thats what im sayin
Chris,so maybe change the color of the vest?
Chris,No
Chris,The actual shirt itself
Chris,the shirt or the design
Chris,on the shirt
Chris,make it contrast
Chris,really? I think the black and blue go well together
Chris,either the pattern colour or the base shirt colour
Chris,they're way too similar
Chris,the design fades into the shirt
Chris,hmm alright
Chris,but i would also recommend toning down the vest as it is much to bright and saturated
Chris,also the male character's hair is wayyyyy too blue and bright as well
Chris,he looks like Sonic
Chris,how about a white shirt instead of black?
Chris,also the whole thing is a bit generic
Chris,yeah that seems better
Chris,
Chris,yes better
Chris,maybe now you should change the socks too
Chris,maybe now she needs white socks
Chris,"and I agree. The guy looks a little too monotone. I want the blue hair, so what other colors should be changed"
Chris,yeah I'd say white socks + black on the shoes
Chris,but i dont think the blue hair would work with anything
Chris,it doesn't suit the art style
Chris,well maybe idk
Chris,"something else to keep in mind....... these aren't ""natural"" designs either. Like no one could have a ponytail that long and think (don't take that out of context)"
Chris,omg
Chris,i know this bro
Chris,i make really unrealistic designs of blue dogs
Chris,but there still are principals of character design
Chris,"I'm aware. Like I said, I think the guy looks a little monotone, so I feel like some colors should be changed"
Chris,probably the bandada
Chris,"other than his hair, because I want to keep the blue hair"
Chris,bandana
Chris,i didnt even see it at first since it matched the shirt color
Chris,"hmm, ok. Or I could change his shirt."
Chris,true
Chris,but if you change the shirt make sure it doesnt clash with the vest or pants
Chris,"but I feel like something other than black. Because then he'd look a little too ""dark"""
Chris,well he's got blue jeans. Almost anything goes with blue jeans
Chris,i also think the shoes look a tad out of place since there is not brown anywhere else
Chris,maybe you could make something else brown
Chris,this is where I got the body for his design.
Chris,wow you barely changed a thing
Chris,he also looks very generic
Chris,like all harem protagonists
Chris,yeah and thats not good
Chris,give him a mohawk
Chris,are you making a harem?
Chris,Not with this guy
Chris,i think the outfit is just kinda plain
Chris,needs something else
Chris,"Well I gave him a scarf, so I thought that added something"
Chris,yeah but idk I personally dont like his vest thingy
Chris,but thats just me
Chris,anyone else?
Chris,I think you're a weeb
Chris,are you an artist at all?
Chris,or are you just making designs to get other people to draw them
Chris,No. Hence why I use other design pieces to make mine
Chris,hmm
Chris,I can't even draw lines without screwing them up
Chris,well thats because you probably havent really practiced
Chris,that's how bad an artist I am
Chris,bruh
Chris,everyone starts off bad
Chris,you're bad for AT LEAST a solid year
Chris,usually way longer
Chris,did it also come across to you I don't feel like becoming an artist. I'd rather not spend a year practicing a skill I'll never use
Chris,fair ig
Chris,you didnt say that at all tho
Chris,"but i mean,, art isnt really a skill you never use if you, yknow, draw"
Chris,Eh
Chris,i find a lot of fulfillment in drawing for the sake of drawing but i know not everyone's like that
Chris,but its not a pointless skill
Chris,Did I ever show you guys my commissions I had done?
Chris,you showed us one
Chris,fair
Chris,lol what kind of response is that
Chris,well there's just one more I plan to get done when his next session opens up
Chris,oh so you've only had one done so far
Chris,I've actually had 2
Chris,1 character done twice
Chris,i thought one of them was a group photo
Chris,"there's the group photo, but there's also the single one, which I had done first"
Chris,this one was more a test
Chris,aaa thats pretty cute
Chris,I do really like this one.
Chris,same shirt design as your new character tho
Chris,this character I mean
Chris,because I use the same one lol
Chris,huh?
Chris,"I wanted to give her a short sleeved shirt with a vest, and that was the best I could find"
Chris,"tbf, her design was made long before the one I just showed you"
Chris,yeah but that doesn't mean you should give your other characters the same clothes lol
Chris,"eh, whether I give these guys full life or not is still in the air. I just made them to kill some time"
Chris,fair ig
Chris,use that creativity tho bro
Chris,this is the girl I plan to get commissioned next.
Chris,who is probably my favorite character of them all
Chris,:o cute
Chris,"A lot of my fans of the fanfiction I write also like her. In fact, in a poll I did on my server, she ranked the highest out of all the others"
Chris,how many people you got in that server? :0
Chris,You have a big enough fan base to have a discord server?
Chris,wow
Chris,"let me check the action number, cause I can't remember"
Chris,"Well I've got 34 on the server, but not all of my fans are on my server"
Chris,if I look at my ff.net account (which is where I post the fanfic)
Chris,"the story has 26 followers, so add that to the 34 on my server"
Chris,wow
Chris,Wow the vanguard wiki even has a page for your alternate universe
Chris,WHAT
Chris,ARE YOU FR
Chris,how'd you find that out???
Chris,google
Chris,please send me link
Chris,"plus there are the ones who don't follow the story or on my server, but I know they're reading it."
Chris,Those I can't count
Chris,did you add that page yourself
Chris,"if it's on the fanon wiki, than yes, I added it myself"
Chris,https://cardfightvanguardfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cardfight!!_Vanguard_X
Chris,Cardfight!! Vanguard X
Chris,Cardfight!! Vanguard X is a fan fiction series made by mrd256. It acts as a sequel to G that takes place 20 years later.
Chris,there's a link to the fanfic on this page
Chris,"just a fair warning, the fanfic might contain a few missing words here and there, and a few grammar mistakes, but I'm trying to get better"
Chris,well idk anything about the original story so
Chris,you actually really don't need to understand the original story to get this.
Chris,"since it takes place in the future and has it's own story.

also, if they recall back the events in the canon, then I throw in a short summery of what happened"
Chris,"for example, in one of the most recent chapters, two canon characters, who are friends with the heroine's father, explain how they became friends with him, which are actual events that happened in the original show."
Chris,"still, i think its odd to read fanfiction if you've never watched/read/whatever the source. I know some people disagree with me though !"
Chris,"eh, I somewhat agree with you"
Chris,the story also has over 400 views and 31 reviews
Chris,What's most valuable lesson you learned while writing this? I plan on writing a book in a few months so some tips would be appreciated.
Chris,"something is, write every character like they are the protagonist of their own story."
Chris,"obviously you have you story's main protagonist, but in reality, everyone leads their own life"
Chris,"So you should reflect that in your stories. Give them personalities that flow with their back stories, and maybe put a little twist on them if you can"
Chris,My story has 4 maybe 5 point of view characters so I'll definitely need to do this
Chris,"for example, maybe a character had a tragic back story, but they act all happy and cheerful"
Chris,maybe use that happy and cheerful personality as way for them to cover up their pain and despair
Chris,"and when their tragic event is brought up, you (the viewer) sees a different side to them you never thought they had"
Chris,that can be a key to make 2 or even 3 dimensional characters
Chris,I've been planning my story for almost a year so I hope it goes well once I start
Chris,I always think of ideas for stories but this one is my favorite of them all
Chris,I've never had one develop so fully before
Chris,"all stories can take time, but sometimes, a good strategy is to release 1 chapter/1 volume at a time. This will make the view anxious or curious as to what's gonna happen next"
Chris,"also, it gives you time to learn what you did wrong in previous chapters and learn from them to improve future ones"
Chris,I'm still trying to decide if I should release my story chapter by chapter or wait until the whole thing is done. I'm leaning towards waiting until its done so I can present the best possible product.
Chris,I'll probably have a small number of test readers who read it live though
Chris,I kinda like to do both
Chris,"if I have a story that's fairly short, I'll just release the whole thing at once"
Chris,"but Vanguard X is a pretty long story, spanning across a total of 4 seasons, and 2 spin off series."
Chris,"where the story lies right now, I'm entering the last chapter of the first arc of season 1"
Chris,I've never written a serious project like this so I have no idea how long it will end up being
Chris,well your first project is always gonna suck. No matter what it is
Chris,I do know it has three main parts though
Chris,I hope to avoid that
Chris,I have done some less serious projects to practice
Chris,I didn't mean to discourage you
Chris,"For me personally, I try to keep a positive mindset."
Chris,I think it leads to the best results.
Chris,That is true
Chris,and that's something I envy about you.
Chris,"lately, I've had a hard time staying positive with all the crap that's been going on in my life"
Chris,Good luck getting though it
Chris,It's actually gotten to the point where I need to see a therapist
Chris,I've already got an appointment scheduled next week
Chris,I've never been to therapy so I don't know much about it but I hope it helps
Chris,me too
Chris,"well it's about time for me to hit the hay. I have work tomorrow, so I'm gonna try and get some sleep"
Chris,good night

Chris,@Feral Nebula ?
Chris,This is my opportunity
Chris,wait what?? how are we supposed to make them
Chris,Don't ask others
Chris,ok
Chris,
Chris,450 is a lot
Chris,I dont care how you make them
Chris,You just need to draw in a single color over the vessels
Chris,and another color over the brain reigons (blue)
Chris,you need 450 of the first image you sent?
Chris,you can probably just use photoshop filters
Chris,I have to create all this fucking training data so I can make a computer automatically do it
Chris,Wait
Chris,You want me to recreate the same image
Chris,with different colours?
Chris,you are basically just creating a label that says
Chris,HEY
Chris,these pixels are blood vessles
Chris,Ok wait hol up
Chris,and these other pixels are NOT blood vessels
Chris,okay send me the files
Chris,it just has to be too colors
Chris,wait i wanna do some too
Chris,uploading them to g drive rn
Chris,its going to take all night
Chris,because I was a fucking retard with the way I extracted these
Chris,and I don't want to redo it lol
Chris,"they don't all have to be done by the same person, right?"
Chris,ehhh honestly it would be best if the same person did it because I am willing to bet there are variations in the way different people would label these images
Chris,so anyone who is interested can fight amongst the other people who want the job
Chris,Ill let the free market work in my favor here 
Chris,I NEED IT
Chris,DIBS
Chris,
Chris,I just need my labelled images ASAP and as cheap as possible
Chris,Gonna make fat stacks
Chris,
Chris,i bet i could do it faster than you

Chris,You have a big foler of a bunch of images similar to this
Chris,"or like, each start from opposite ends and meet in the middle"
Chris,That you just need in different colours?
Chris,Are they all coloured in purple and yellow?
Chris,Oh wait
Chris,a
Chris,minute
Chris,I get it
Chris,Actually small append
Chris,BLACK for vessels
Chris,WHITE for brain reigons
Chris,and yes I am willing to have a race
Chris,Ava will start from the bottom of the folder
Chris,chris will start from the top
Chris,wait how is that a race then
Chris,wtf
Chris,whoever gets halfway through first has to do the rest?
Chris,what ab out me
Chris,whoever reaches the halfway point first
Chris,okay chris starts at the top
Chris,dober starts at the 1 /3
Chris,OKAY FUCK THIS
Chris,that seems like a waste of time tho for whoever doesnt win
Chris,Just fight amongst yourselves and decide who gets the job
Chris,i'm going to bed!
Chris,what format are the files in?
Chris,JPG
Chris,bruh
Chris,needs more JPG
Chris,smh bad business man just abandoning things
Chris,Wrong
Chris,I am going to let the market work in my favor while sleeping
Chris,When I wakeup someone will have won the contract by out bidding there components for who can do the work cheapest and quickest  Or if you guys are really smart you will conspire by electing 1 person to officially take the job. Demanding a hire wage for that person. Then splitting the work amongst yourselfs
Chris,  Food for thought  ? 
Chris,i thought you said one person had to do them all

Chris,especially cause someone I know and usually beat is seeded 14th (he actually enters these so they know how to place him) so I have a chance to make some upsets

Chris,we also somehow had 90 ping
Chris,but I don't think that would have changed the results one bit

Chris,"There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.
All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.
IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.
IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.
Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.
Cognitive ability is substantially heritable, apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent."

Chris,locked behind fucking paywalls
Chris,what the fuck is this bullshit
Chris,have u tried sci-hub
Chris,I might have to
Chris,but mostly I just want to highlight the sheer incompetence of this professor
Chris,"like, maybe he has memberships to all these random ass journals on software development"
Chris,but his students sure as hell don't
Chris,also our summary/review thing has to be 2 pages and the only one of these papers I've found that isn't pay-to-read is only two pages including pictures
Chris,the summary would have to be longer than the original
Chris,shoot me
Chris,haha good luck with that

Chris,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence.
Chris,By dropping the slippers while equipped they get placed back into our inventory which we can then drop again to reach the entity limit blocking the spawn of Stan's family as well as the newspaper he reads during the newspaper sequence. Then by continually bouncing off the slippers and the bed we can generate enough momentum to clip through the floor and skip the window sequence.

Chris,?
Chris,@everyone games cs ow ?
Chris,@here
Chris,games
Chris,SURE
Chris,i guess thats a no from everone else lol
Chris,So I just thought of an interesting challenge.
Chris,"I call it the ""Bottom Tier Challenge""

You take the lowest tiered character in some kind of competitive fighting game (like Smash), and you keep doing random join ups with random people, until you get a legitimate victory using that character.

here's what counts as a legitimate victory. You have to win via the conditions set in the rules. You cannot win via a timeout, or your opponent disconnects.

You stop play at all before you get a legit win, you fail the challenge."
Chris,very neat idea
Chris,Have you won this challenge in any games?
Chris,I have not.
Chris,Also @Max you were up pretty early this morning

Chris,no
Chris,dont get it
Chris,alright tuning into 5 streams rn
Chris,is it any more effective to have multiple streams open?
Chris,idk if this works but in theory you could open a stream and mute it so your twitch default opens streams muted them jsut go to the valorant directory and middle click each stream to open them all then ctrl+tab through them all so they are all marked as open then just minimize hte window
Chris,cause you dont have to actually have hte stream unmuted on an active window to recieve drops
Chris,@Cs:go

Chris,oh also you missed that one game where Kameron went like 32-6
Chris,he was going pretty ham last night

- Greg || Jed
- Ben
- Ben ^2
- Smithy

Chris,oh boy apparently the Valorant anti-cheat has root-level access to your computer 24/7
Chris,we have all handed riot our entire computers
Chris,@The Rona I forgot to add zain and since you were last you are out 
Chris,Sounds like Zain's problem
Chris,‍♂️
Chris,Nah dude
Chris,"so yeah even if they weren't already, China now owns your entire computer"
Chris,uh
Chris,"""Ring-0 is essentially the lowest level something can run in.

Running in this permission level essentially means that a given driver has full administrative access to your operating system before it even throws a login screen. It can monitor the boot process, check every driver and device that loads at boot (at least after it's loaded), and can run arbitrary code without any input or knowledge from the user.

It doesn't matter whether you're logged in or not, or whether you've even played the game recently. It is ALWAYS running."""
Chris,and uninstalling Valorant won't uninstall the monitoring
Chris,so we have to reinstall windows?
Chris,wait i'm not sure that's true
Chris,you can uninstall it manually but it's a separate thing
Chris,and significantly more complicated
Chris,I saw someone talking about this in a stream too
Chris,It is true
Chris,wtf
Chris,Wait so am I not in the 10 man
Chris,Rip
Chris,and posts about this stuff is getting banned on r/valorant
Chris,Also people were reporting performance loss in other games due to this
Chris,so what do I need to delete?
Chris,whoops
Chris,@Matt I forgot about max too
Chris,Max has your spot sorry buddy
Chris,Whew
Chris,Accept the Chinese Communist Party into your heart
Chris,
Chris,this is riots response to it
Chris,yeah what do I delete
Chris,Why did you delete that
Chris,"If you delete it, then you can't play the game"
Chris,"there's some control panel level stuff, here's the thread I'm seeing: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/g0gdug/riots_trusted_valorant_mods_deleted_a_thread/"
Chris,r/pcgaming - Riot's 'Trusted' /Valorant mods deleted a thread about...
Chris,"9,084 votes and 1,544 comments so far on Reddit"
Chris,
Chris,but then yeah you can't play the game
Chris,"TL;DR Yes we run a driver at system startup, it doesn't scan anything (unless the game is running), it's designed to take up as few system resources as possible and it doesn't communicate to our servers. You can remove it at anytime.

Vanguard contains a driver component called vgk.sys (similar to other anti-cheat systems), it's the reason why a reboot is required after installing. Vanguard doesn't consider the computer trusted unless the Vanguard driver is loaded at system startup (this part is less common for anti-cheat systems).

This is good for stopping cheaters because a common way to bypass anti-cheat systems is to load cheats before the anti-cheat system starts and either modify system components to contain the cheat or to have the cheat tamper with the anti-cheat system as it loads. Running the driver at system startup time makes this significantly more difficult.

We've tried to be very careful with the security of the driver. We've had multiple external security research teams review it for flaws (we don't want to accidentally decrease the security of the computer like other anti-cheat drivers have done in the past). We're also following a least-privilege approach to the driver where the driver component does as little as possible preferring to let the non-driver component do the majority of work (also the non-driver component doesn't run unless the game is running)."
Chris,I'd rather not play the game then have my data mined
Chris,"The Vanguard driver does not collect or send any information about your computer back to us. Any cheat detection scans will be run by the non-driver component only when the game is running.

The Vanguard driver can be uninstalled at any time (it'll be ""Riot Vanguard"" in Add/Remove programs) and the driver component does not collect any information from your computer or communicate over the network at all.

We think this is an important tool in our fight against cheaters but the important part is that we're here so that players can have a good experience with Valorant and if our security tools do more harm than good we will remove them (and try something else). For now we think a run-at-boot time driver is the right choice."
Chris,thats the riot response
Chris,Lets review the fax
Chris,bullshit
Chris,literally no one else does this and it's functionally malware
Chris,riot is conviniently owned by 10cent
Chris,they can run anything they want on your computer with this
Chris,it's also not stopping hackers
Chris,"and even assuming there's no malicious intent, the second this gets cracked fuckin anyone who wants gets root level access to your computer and can do malicious things with it"
Chris,antivirus software does this
Chris,yes but our antivirus software isn't owned by a company owned by China
Chris,a country famous for not invading privacy for malicious purposes
Chris,"also, people are already beating the anticheat"
Chris,so it's not insane to assume someone has or will soon beat the security and boom we're all even more compromised
Chris,apparently this is an article response to it https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/dev-null-anti-cheat-kernel-driver/
Chris,/dev/null: Anti-Cheat Kernel Driver - League of Legends
Chris,We’re protecting some of Riot’s upcoming games with new anti-cheat systems.
Chris,yeh I still don't really trust it
Chris,"because no matter what it's still extremely sketchy to need that level of access, especially if it's not working"
Chris,yeah if we are going this tin foil hat then there is literally nothing any one could say
Chris,yup
Chris,but there's plenty of good reasons to tinfoil hat on this one
Chris,Yeah literally
Chris,namely the censorship of r/valorant
Chris,"on the other hand, there's no real reason to panic cause odds are your computer's already hella compromised"
Chris,fusion doesnt use a vpn when he torrents all of those games so i doubt hes scared of anyone
Chris,ok if we are worried about the big bad tencent and china then we must be worried about all of these companies as well right https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/
Chris,Every game company that Tencent has invested in
Chris,A quick reference of how China's largest tech conglomerate has quietly expanded into videogames.
Chris,@Jed
Chris,have my spot
Chris,@Zain
Chris,"yes, yes I am Zain"
Chris,but none of them have installed root-level permission software on my computer
Chris,Zack you can get so much information off of discord but why do you still use this application when Tencent has invested in it as well
Chris,"like, on one hand, I'm still gonna play Valorant because I assume everything I do is already tracked by at least someone sketchy because realistically you can't avoid it, but on the other hand, I think people should understand what's going on

also are you insane in comparing what they can get out of discord vs. always on root access"
Chris,if we are worried about selling our information or compromising or security this would priority number one no?
Chris,"discord can't run any code it wants with any level of permission on my computer without me knowing about it
discord can't see every single thing I do on my computer
discord can't look at every single file on my computer at all times"
Chris,"discord can see what I put into discord: messages, voice, occasionally video, what game I'm playing, and the files I post"
Chris,ok sure
Chris,facts dood

Chris,"Copied from another server: PLEASE do not play TF2 or ANY source games in the meantime. A serious leak of source code has been reportedly leaked into the public. If true, it means source games are easily compromised and you should not play them at the moment.What this means is cheaters could potentially install programs or get information from your PC through source games if true.(Allegedly) the developer of cathook has discovered a way to RCE (remote code execute) on TF2 just by you being in the server. This allows anyone who does this to run any code on your computer, including viruses, turning your game into an aimbot, or deleting your items. Playing any source game, including TF2 is dangerous right now, and we suggest not playing until there is some kind of fix for this."

Chris,ever noticed how f and j have marks on them

Chris,owch
Chris,You know something's up when you don't know even remotely what class someone is by looking at test questions
Chris,This is the least relevant test I've ever seen
Chris,Most of the questions are normal but like 20% are garbage like above
Chris,"I don't know if what I said sounded insulting, but believe me, I'm only insulting the test."
Chris,
Chris,ikd max but that sounds like an insult
Chris,I wrote it poorly
Chris,I was trashing the test
Chris,not you
Chris,if i had to take a guess i'd say its some type of philisophical course but like
Chris,lol
Chris,"Sorry Benson, I only realized it could sound like an insult towards you like 30 seconds after sending it"
Chris,Definitely was not my intention
Chris,non taken. just poking fun at your wording choice
